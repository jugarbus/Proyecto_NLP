15,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/moonlight-2016/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,kyle20ellis,"Mar 18, 2022",8,"Wanted to see as many 2016 films as possible, especially those that won or were nominated for the big awards. Took me a while to see 'Moonlight', with the controversy it garnered when it was announced for the Best Picture Oscar and the amount of hate it's got here part of me was wary.

Finally getting round to seeing 'Moonlight', it turned out that it was more than well worth the while and that the wariness was not needed. 'Moonlight' is not a perfect film and may not have been my personal pick for the Best Picture award (for me that was 'La La Land' though that is not a popular opinion it seems). Truly admired what it set out to do and found it a brave and powerful film, despite what the detractors say there is far more to 'Moonlight's' appeal than politics, sexuality and race (clearly trying to find conspiracy theories and reasons for why a film they dislike is loved by others, without taking into account that the film simply just connected to and resonated with those who liked it).

'Moonlight' does end on an anti-climactic note, some of the last act is a bit rushed. A longer length would have helped as a result, it also would have helped make a couple of events in the first act a little clearer and not so choppy.

It may not say much new, despite the ground-breaking concept on paper with the exploration of lives rarely seen on film, and doesn't always have subtlety. Then again it is tackling far from subtle themes and a heavy subject, so that sort of was going to be inevitable.

However, 'Moonlight' is an exceptionally well made film. The cinematography and editing are some of the most eye-pleasing and best of that year, and can't find anything to fault the expertly handled direction. The music is cleverly mixed and has haunting power and fluidity.

Regarding the writing, it is not perfect, at times as said a little heavy-handed and vague in parts, but it is thought-provoking and handles very ambitious, relevant, important themes with power, truth and (mostly) delicacy. The story makes the most of the three act structure, it's handled simply but not simplistically and also handled cleverly and with passion, honesty and intelligence. Found myself relating quite a lot to and being moved significantly by the story and found the film handled a heavy and sensitive subject matter with a lot of relevance and importance today more than admirably.

Can't fault the acting, doing wonders with compellingly real characters and strongly defined character relationships (especially the central one). Much has been made of Maharshala Ali and Naomie Harris and deservedly with two of the best performances that year, Ali especially is extraordinary. It is easy though to overlook Alex R. Hibbert, Trevante Rhodes and Ashton Sanders and one shouldn't, as they are just as worthy (particularly Sanders).

Overall, didn't completely blow me away but very well done and with a lot to admire. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

17,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/moonlight-2016/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,ben1322,"Sep 4, 2021",9,"The best way to describe Moonlight is a painting that is so realistic that it looks like a picture. The film tackles issues people may not have even crossed that average viewer's mind and does it brilliantly. It does not over dramatize, or over romanticize any moment. Everything is exactly how it should be. It provides insight into all types of challenges mixed into one perspective. Camera work also makes the movie feel first person. Scenes where the camera is half submerged into the ocean invokes nostalgia of when you were young and could barely keep your head above water. Everytime the film leaps in time to a different point in Chiron’s life, the viewer has a lot of catching up to do. Chiron changes on the surface in a substantial manner. However, eventually, you realize that each and every Chiron is the same on the inside. The message of self identity in this film is hammered home. I go back to my point of the film being a realistic painting. Many directors aim for twists on their films to make it feel authentic to themselves, similar to how Picasso may skew his paintings to make it identifiable as “a Picasso” . Barry Jenkins' approach was to make this film authentic to the viewer. He focused on the truth of the matter at hand. He found success in making the matter relatable to viewers who may have never thought to relate to Chiron."

Poignant is, main character, Chiron’s alienation from his peers and through the world of a child, you have to work out why he is different.

Meanwhile the score excellently captures the many different moods of his internal journey, fear, love, torment, betrayal and reconciliation.

Chiron is perceived as a victim and bullied until one striking incident. His life is shown at 3 different stages in 3 acts and each offer the viewer something different.

A lot of thought is put behind the story and you can see the intelligence in the smaller details. It took me a second watch to fully enjoy and appreciate the depth behind this masterpiece."

La banda sonora es bellísima, lo único que no me gustó fue que se deshicieran de Juan tan repentinamente, ya que así se tiró por el drenaje toda su breve aparición en la vida de Chiron."

The second act is without question the highlight of the story, where there is a drive behind the plot: we see the beauty and the ugliness perfectly captured within Chiron's life. The shots where the character's look into the camera are fantastic at drawing you into the feelings of the character. Sadly, the film lacks narrative depth and the plot is limited.

If there's any lesson to be learned, it's that Moonlight's subtlety enhances its message and themes, and they don't play it safe, which is fairly hard in a social atmosphere that wouldn't praise its message. What I love about this film is that it isn't afraid to show the reality for its protagonist. Homosexuality in his community is a rough subject that isn't received well and is sadly filled with prejudice. There are some story hiccups, but the visuals are well suited for its nuanced theme."

I'm going to talk about the best of this movie first and I'll begin with a big praise towards its WONDERFUL cinematrogtaphy and directing. All the shots in this movie are beautiful and the color palette adds to the intended mood of what the audience is watching. This is one of the most visually stunning movies I've seen in recent memory, I swear I could only rewatch it too see the beautiful shots this movie has. The performances are great and add to the realism this movie tries to give.

What this movie, for me at least, doesn't do that great, is everything else. The plot wasn't that great or interesting. The movie failed to make me care about the characters and the plot, because it wasn't too interesting. There's a huge plot hole between Chiron's adolescence and its adulthood, I don't know, maybe some more minutes of runtime to see what happened to him during that time gap, I think that could've added to his character, and most of the movie felt pretty standard and forgettable, nothing too bad, but anything great.

However the ending is so heartbreaking and perfect when you stop and think about it, the last shot of the movie is one of my favorites in recent memory, I think that the ending was what redeemed this movie.

This isn't my favorite movie of 2016 and it's not a great movie, it's good, the cinematography, acting, directing and the ending is what gives this movie a lot of points. It's a pretty bland and forgettable movie for the most part but those aspects I just mentioned are what save this movie from being bad."

The directing is absolutely flawless, with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the film's themes of social inequality. The way Bong uses vertical space to represent class hierarchy is brilliant - from the cramped semi-basement of the Kim family to the architectural marvel of the Park residence. 

The script is equally impressive, seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary. The dialogue is razor-sharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced, with shocking twists that never feel contrived. The way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to Bong's exceptional storytelling skills.

What elevates this film beyond mere social commentary is how it refuses to paint its characters in black and white terms. Both families are sympathetic yet flawed, making the inevitable collision all the more devastating. I give it a perfect 10/10 - a true modern masterpiece that rewards multiple viewings."

Unpredictably composed, Parasite shifts effortlessly between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in deep breaths, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, the inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.

The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."

Also throwing away the satire genre’s usual ways, transcending deeper into the world of grim, depressing black comedy that highlights the lack of brightness in our everyday struggles not with diseases, not with evil monsters, not with a lack of food and water supply, but out struggles with people. And the struggles of classes fitting into this world of deceit, lies and brutal honesty."

I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film’s message is a little on the nose but I don’t have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film’s slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film’s story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It’s so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it’s always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I’m using the word tension a lot but that’s what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose."

When it comes to dog centric films, I tend to not watch them because let’s just be honest - most of them are sad. Beautiful, but sad. Togo may look like just another Disney dog movie, but it is so much more. This film blew me away from start to finish. And one really interesting fact about this film is it IS based on a true story. I even fact checked the movie after and was floored to find how truly faithful this movie is to the real events.

If you grew up with the animated film Balto, I can’t recommend the watch more, it takes the story of a dog mushing adventure that we loved as kids but made for the whole family - and especially us adults.  Willem Dafoe again proves his worth as an actor, giving a beautiful performance and Julianne Nicholson was a brilliant cast to back his character up. Give it a watch - you don’t be disappointed."

I disagree with some of the extreme fanfare, but that is not to say that many of his works are quite stellar. While I still prefer Children of Men, Roma offers many new experiences that I admit to enjoying. Roma is mostly a stark drama which explores class divide, marital struggle, and how unresolved broken relations can leave lasting wounds. The cinematography is the best part of Roma; there are maybe two poorly shot scenes, but the others more than make up for these. Roma is filled with expansive landscapes and busy scenes. The set pieces and extras are phenomenal; nothing feels phoney and there is a lot of everything. The riot and search scenes are filmed over large sprawling areas with well-coordinated groups of people all portraying different characters. Roma tells the story of a dysfunctional family, the maid who serves them, and the struggles they face as the economy and family structure collapse around them. Cuarón has truly created a long-lasting masterpiece in Roma, something that will be studied and returned to again and again."

117,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/roma/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Alex_P,"Mar 30, 2020",10,"Roma... is single handedly the most slow paced and boring movie I have ever watched. But it is also the most exciting, scary, thought provoking and interesting movie I've ever seen. It takes it's time to tell a story, and it makes that clear in the first couple minutes of the film, where we watch a floor being washed for a solid 3 minutes, which doesn't seem like long but it drags on. The first two acts are interesting, sure, but slow and it drags out. Then all of a sudden, in the third act, BAM! everything happens, and we have been well prepared with the previous hour and 30 minutes of film to deal with it. It is definitely not everyone's movie, but wow, it's one hell of a snail ride.
The cinematography speaks for itself, as most people associate Roma with the cinematography. It is fantastic, probably the best I've seen, but people don't give enough credit to the sound editing. If you haven't seen it yet, do NOT watch this on a tv (unless itis widescreen surround sound) watch it on a big phone or tablet, with a wide screen and put high quality surround sound headphones in. Obviously It would of been ideal to watch it at the cinema, but it's too late now. You really need to pay attention to this movie, don't have it on in the background, you need to watch it and focus on it
The reviews speak for themselves, this is less of a movie, more like Art, with a Capitol A."

126,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/roma/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Alinzpark,"Jun 17, 2019",10,"“Roma”, written, directed, edited, produced, and shot by Alfonso Cuarón (Children of Men, Gravity) is a plain and simple masterpiece. Set in 1970’s Mexico, the film follows Cleo (played by first-time actress Yalitza Aparicio), a middle maid for a middle-class family. The film began streaming on Netflix December 14th of this year.    The story of Roma is an unusual one as it seemingly has no narrative structure. It follows Cleo as she performs her duties as the surrogate mother of the family, goes on dates and hangs out with her friends. Despite the loose structure, the story is far from listless. It possesses a hypnotic pace; slowly drawing towards an emotional climax. The seemingly meandering plot turns out to actually be a meticulous set up for not one, but a sequence of gutwrenching payoffs towards the latter part of the film.    This film is one of the few in Cuarón’s filmography that isn’t shot by longtime collaborator Emmanuel Lubezki with Roma rather being shot by Cuarón himself. That being said, the influence of Lubezki is certainly felt on the style of cinematography (though similarities to the 3-time Oscar-winner is hardly a bad thing). That isn’t to say the film lacks visual character. it’s shot in stunning black-and-white with the camera moving in a hypnotic, smooth manner; rarely interrupted by cuts.    The acting is as excellent as one would expect, with Yalitza Aparicio being a standout. Because of this, it is unfortunate that Cuarón rarely gives his actors the opportunity to show off their skills, as the camera is often pulled extremely far out; not allowing for much expression.    There is an unspoken rule in film criticism to be sparing with the word “masterpiece”. If one overuses the term, it loses its gravity. That being said, Roma is a film worthy of the title. It is a narrative and technical marvel. It is an absolute masterpiece."

Beautifully directed, excellent performances and cinematography. Cuarón balances nostalgia and sentiment just right without things getting overbearing but still gripping you. It’s a shame not more movies like this reach cinemas. In a world saturated by superhero movies and kid stuff one can only reminisce the good old times when cinema was truly in the hands of daring filmmakers with a vision. What does it say of our current movie going culture that everything is, so dumbed down?"
130,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/roma/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,BrunoVn00,"Mar 31, 2019",9,"This is an amazing visual masterpiece and a great example of wonderful cinematography. Director Alfonso Cuarón made an incredible and realistic representation of Mexico in the 1970s, there's so much attention to detail in every single shot that really indicate that this movie is about the experience and not the plot.

By that, I'm saying that the weakest point of this movie, for me, at least, it's the weak and simplistic plot. If you tell to someone that hasn't seen the movie a basic plot summary, that person might not find it too interesting. Obviously I'm not expecting dumb action or explosions or whatever, I do appreciate slow-paced movies when they have interesting visuals and this is one of those movies, but you need to be lying if you don't say that the plot of this movie isn't anything special and if you watch it and you ONLY focus on the story and not on anything else, this movie might become boring for you.

The direction is fantastic with tons of dynamic and complicated shots and tons of style and attetion to detail. Believe it or not this is a big scale movie because there's always tons of things happening on screen to watch and talk about. The setting feels organic, feels massive and realistic, it honestly feels like the crew traveled back in time to film in actual 1970s Mexico.

The acting is fine. Nothing bad or nothing too great. There wasn't any actor that I felt that gave a bad performance, every actor seems to have made the best with the characters they were given and again, nothing too special, I honestly don't think Yalitza Aparicio's or Marina de Tavira's acting was something Oscar-worthy, not saying they gave a bad performance, but nothing great, either.

When I said this movie is about the experience is to appreaciate anything but the plot or the acting, this is not a film for everyone which, for me, it's something bad because I think that the greatest movies can appeal to almost everyone and not only film critics, film experts or film students or art-house lovers. There are tons of movies that can appeal to anyone and are at the same time great artsy movies.

I actually liked this movie, but I don't think it's anything outstanding."

138,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/roma/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,AJGo85,"Feb 27, 2019",9,"A movie like Roma does not come along too often. The new film by master filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón has the look and feel of an epic film and the intimacy and emotion of a small, personal film. From the trailer, plot description, and lavish, wordy praise it’s received from critics you might get the impression that Roma is the epitome of an arthouse movie. Perhaps it is, if that means it is also a beautiful, superbly crafted, and deeply affecting cinematic achievement. It’s hard to describe what makes Roma so special because it elicits such an emotional response in the people it connects with, myself included. Roma works on so many levels I suspect any viewer will connect with it in some way.
Cuarón’s screenplay is loosely based on his experiences as a boy in Mexico City in the early 1970’s, specifically on his relationship with the family maid/nanny. This is not a story about a young boy, however. Seeking to pay tribute to the women that raised him, Cuarón makes them the focus of the movie. He even dedicates this film to his real life nanny, Liboria ""Libo"" Rodriguez. We follow a year in the life Cleo, a servant for an upper-class family in the Mexico City district of Roma. She cleans the house (including endless amounts of dog poop), cares for the children, and is treated as lovingly as a servant can be by her employers. First time actress Yalitza Aparicioas Cleo is so good and feels so natural in her role that she’s earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Marina deTavira has received a Supporting Actress nomination for her role as the family matriarch, Sofia.
Cleo’s eventful year begins when her boyfriend abandons her in a movie theater after she tells him that she is pregnant. At the same time, we gather from overheard snippets of conversations between Sofia and other adults that her husband has left the family. She tells her children that their father is on a long business trip in Canada. Sofia and Cleo do not necessarily become any closer, but Sofia and her mother are happy for Cleo and take her to see the doctor. The life events in Roma, both big and small, are episodic, but thankfully the story never meanders or feels aimless. Cleo accompanies the family to a relative’s estate, goes on a search for her wayward boyfriend, and goes with the family on a vacation to the beach. The outside world intrudes abruptly and harshly into Cleo’s day to day life though natural and man-made disasters. The focus is kept on Cleo throughout these events, which in a way makes them more real. A forest fire at a New Year’s party provides some of the film’s most memorable images. Just as the children are only marginally aware of the world of the adults until they feel a direct effect, so too are the adults with the larger world. Roma is not without some heavy-handed moments such as when a toast to someone’s doesn’t happen because the cup breaks, or when the characters go to see Marooned (I’m sure both Cleo and Sofia feel that they have been marooned by the men in their lives).
For Roma Cuarón did the cinematography himself, and it is safe to say that he learned a thing or two from his long-time cinematographer, the legendary Emmanuel Lubezki, who has won 3 Oscars in a row. Cuarón shot his picture in glorious black & white on 65mm cameras. This is what makes Roma so visually stunning and gives it the feel of an epic. Typically, 65mm cameras are used for big budget action films like Lawrence of Arabia, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and, most recently, Dunkirk. When a modern filmmaker uses black and white, they tend to emphasize shadows. Cuarón’s camera captures wonderful shadows but it is much more concerned with what light illuminates. Sunlight seems to make everything it touches have an ethereal and dreamlike glow. The black & white makes every image feel like an old photograph conjuring old memories and emotions. Whenever the camera moves it is slow and deliberate and long, unbroken shots are numerous. Cuarón does not use many, if any, close ups. Instead his camera keeps its distance acting like window into Cleo’s life. The emotions in this story are so universal that you don’t need tight close ups on faces to know what a character is feeling or share in their emotions.
I expect Roma will challenge Children of Men’s title as his masterpiece and make an appearance on the next round Best of the Decade lists.
Roma received a very brief theatrical release from its online streaming distributor, Netflix. It played in Austin in just one theater for two weeks and I was lucky enough to see it on a big screen. Seeing these images projected larger than life was a very enjoyable experience. I watched Roma again on my TV recently, and it is still visually and emotionally compelling. This is the sign of a truly great film. No matter how or when you see it, those sights and sounds will swirl around and take you on a journey."

By Chase M
	Not only is Roma (2018) Alfonso Cuarnó’s most personal work, it’s also his best. The film grabs you from the first frame, and doesn’t let you go until the end of its 2:15 run time. Cuarón’s mastery of the camera is evident in scene. Every shot contains so much painstaking detail; you can’t help but feel the passion and commitment that went into this project. Roma, is the story of Cleo who works as a maid for a middle class family in the 1970s. The film documents a year in her life.
	Before I discuss anything else, let me heap more praise onto what Cuarón did. To take these childhood experiences, and recreate them in such a loving way is something truly special. The writing in this film is simple yet moving. The film really made me care about, and connect with the character of Cleo. Cuarón’s cinematography is something to marvel at as well. Each shot is beautifully presented, and the lighting is top notch all the way through. I could go on about how great the camera work is, but I won’t. Just know it’s something special and go experience it.
	The performances are all strong. Particularly those of Cleo and Sofía, played by Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira. Both embody the strong female figures that become the focus of the film. Aparicio as a first time actress is particularly impressive, she delivers a powerful performance full of emotion. The acting nominations for these two, were well deserved.
	Roma is a masterpiece. It is the culmination of all the work Alfonso Cuarón has put in throughout his career. I was skeptical going in (mostly due to the fact that it’s a Netflix movie) but I loved every second of it. This movie is a victory for foreign film makers everywhere. It’s a shame the Academy didn't pick Roma as ‘best picture’, because it deserved it more than any of the other nominees. Regardless, Roma is exceptional in every sense of the word and deserves to be experienced by anyone who appreciates the art of cinema. 10/10"

It's generally one of the best foreign films this year. Sound design is jaw-dropping from the music to the small sound effects. The world feels so real and lively and nobody is off and out of place. I love the black and white style filter, since taking place from 1970 to 1971. It makes feel like I'm there. Every actor and actress even the kids were fantastic, maybe because of the script (It's generally very real like actual people would say).

Please watch this film. It's one of the best Netflix movie I have seen before which is rare to come across. Thank you Alfonso Cuarón for writing and directing this masterpiece."

Gorgeous cinematography, emotionally gripping storytelling and great acting as well. It's also incredibly apparent the Cuarron is at his absolute best here which considering his pedigree is almost unbelievable. However with all of that being said I did not enjoy the movie that much personally. I found it overall to be a very lonely and boring movie that just overall didn't have a lot of interesting things going on up until the last hour or so of the film. I'm almost sure this is somebody's cup of tea if you are a cinema connoisseur but I just found it hard to get through and had to watch it in about three different sessions. I'm quite sure this will be taking all the Oscars this year and I do think it's deserving of it because after walking away from it I found my still having an enormous amount of respect for it at the very least. Which is why despite my personal feelings about the movie I would be lying to not at least give it a solid 8/10."

Trajo escenas majestuosas como el plano secuencia final en Niños de Hombre o la escena inicial en Gravedad. Pero con esta consolida ese estilo implantado sus anteriores realizaciones.

Lavar los platos o limpiar el corredor de una casa se vuelve hermoso y se siente real. Planos generales y pausados, mostrando la influencia que tiene de Emmanuel Lubezki con un trabajo excelente en la profundidad de campo, van envolviéndonos en la cotidianidad  de una empleada doméstica de una familia medio acomodada durante los 70. La estupenda fotografía de Cuarón y la edición convierte a la película en una recordatorio fiel y con el mismo impacto de un documental sobre esa época, trayendo una experiencia sensorial pocas veces vista en una película.

No solo la recreación de la época sorprende, sino el retrato que hace sobre el rol de la mujer en la familia a través de Cleo, recordando y tributando con esperanza y deseos de reflexión. Cuarón toma momentos de su vida para construir este relato contemplativo y pausado que llega a un punto de clímax pasando por escenas que hipnotizan por su complejidad y belleza. La actuación de Yalitza Aparicio cautiva desde el inicio, sin impostaciones ni sobre-actuación, mostrando una imagen honesta sobre su condición y además la soledad y miedo al desamparo. La nueva actriz a logrado conmover y mostrado su talento en esta película, que seguro sera recordada como lo mejor del cine latinoamericano moderno."

.
( 72/100 )
.
Roma es una colección de fotografías que evocan una memoria con un valor sensible increíble, pero, como dije hace un párrafo, no puedes planear una memoria, y Roma es una memoria muy bien planeada.
Cuaron no es un tonto y estoy seguro de que sabe cada una de las razones de sus decisiones y el alcance de ellas, lo admiro plenamente por ello. Sin embargo yo no me dejaré llevar tan fácilmente.
Roma relata uno de los fragmentos más importantes en la vida de Cleo, quien trata de darle vida al recuerdo de Libo, quien fue la sirvienta, cuidadora y nana de la familia de Cuaron. Cleo será quien nos transporte por la ciudad y las habitaciones; quien nos hable de las personas, de los romances y odios; las clases sociales, los paisajes, los niños, los adultos y, en sí, el panorama intimo de la sociedad mexicana en los 70's.
Cuaron reafirma su capacidad de hacer cine y su gran habilidad poética. Él se demuestra como una de las personalidades más responsables, humanas, emotivas y conscientes en su arte. Esto no es nuevo, pues en cada uno de sus proyectos sorprende narrativa, visual y simbólicamente. Sin embargo, Roma, como una carta personal a sus seres queridos, no lo siento como su mejor proyecto. A pesar de que cuida y detalla cada plano de sus tomas con paisajes, eventos y rostros, la película es pesada por el hecho de que pretende hacer que su público contemple lo más posible. Uno de los amigos con los que fui a verla mencionó al salir: ""Siento que la película podría alargarse todo lo que sea y yo podría seguir viéndola a gusto."" Le doy la razón, el nivel de encanto que el público le tenga a la película depende del nivel de atención que le preste a Cuaron, y la paciencia de cargar, no solo con la historia, sino con el lugar y tiempo mismo de la exposición. Dicha exposición es, repito, una colección de memorias fotográficas. La memoria no necesita de narrativa extra, de visualización extra, de buenas actuaciones, de un guión, de una dirección y de un elenco enorme para construir grandes y bellos espacios, sino al revés. El contexto, la actitud, la interacción y la situación están delimitadas por la misma memoria fotográfica. Y Cuaron tomó sus mejores fotografías, las recordó, construyó un escenario para recrearlas, escogió a la gente necesaria para representarla e, independientemente de la calidad, la presentó. Eso no solo es injusto, sino también un golpe bajo. Por eso hay gente enojada con Yalitza Aparicio y su falta de trayectoria; y Marina De Tavira y su falta de presencia comercial. Pero también es por eso que han sido muy merecidamente premiadas con sus nominaciones al Oscars.
El ingenio reside en que Cuaron ha escogido los retratos más bellos no de su vida, sino de la vida. Así como esas pequeñas brisas de paz que me acariciaron aquel día en el que estuve en el bote, él toma a todo su equipo y los pone frente a la cámara para reaccionar ante la belleza de la vida y sus diferentes significados. La belleza de hablar con un niño, la belleza del cuerpo, la belleza del llanto, la belleza un abrazo, de un temblor, tanto en el cuerpo como en el alma, de una abandono, de una búsqueda, de una lucha, de una muerte y una victoria. Cuaron sabe que hay belleza en la vida y lo usa a su favor, usa a la vida para expresarla en su película junto a un elenco que no necesita nada más que ser sensible a ella misma. Por lo tanto no importa que la fotografía tenga efectos especiales, o que el guión salte abruptamente a una resolución incoherente con la actitud de los personajes, personajes que no demuestran un estilo de vida extraordinario. Mientras todos los elementos sean bien advertidos de qué, lo que están haciendo no es actuar y trabajar, sino vivir, todo estará bien. No me quiero extender más. El film es hermoso, y está muy bien filmado, la esperanza que tiene Roma en que el público sea tan sensible, paciente, atento y melancólico es demasiada. Personalmente, tengo suficiente belleza en mi propia vida como para querer verla a través de las fotos de alguien más. Otros tendrán suficiente belleza en la suya como para apreciar la de alguien más. Otros carecerán de belleza en su vida como para ser capaces de admirar la de alguien más, o tal vez carecen tanto de ella que son incapaces de reconocerla aunque la vean en una película. Sea cual sea la situación, Roma es una belleza que no es difícil encontrar en la vida que cada uno de nosotros va fotografiando y coleccionando en su memoria."

Yönetmenin, 70'lerin Meksikasını bize yansıtmak için siyah beyaz yapmayı seçtiği filmin neredeyse her resminde geniş açıyı tercih etmiş. Seyirciyi filmin tam anlamıyla içerisine almak için de pan ve dolly hareketlerini çok efektif biçimde kullanmış bence. Başından sonuna kadar sıradan ama sıcak bir hikaye işlenen filmin uzun ve tek planlı sahneleri filmin sanatsal yönünü de bir o kadar ortaya çıkarmaya yardımcı olmuş. Ayrıca uzun sahnelerdeki trafik de yönetmenin bu film için ne kadar titiz çalıştığını gösterir gibi. Cannes film festivaline, Netflix yapımı olduğu için alınmayan film bu sebeple bu sene oldukça konuşuldu. Bence de eğer bir festival bu sebeple film kabul etmiyorsa tüm kabul ettiği filmler bağımsız olmalı. Kısacası tam bir yönetmen filmi olan Roma, kesinlikle izlenmesi gerektiğini düşündüğüm filmlerden biri."

Dort trifft er seinen 16-jährigen Neffen Patrick (Lucas Hedges), den er schon Jahre nicht mehr gesehen hat und jetzt soll er sich um ihn kümmern. Der Film zeigt in mehreren Rückblenden die Geschichte von Lee und wie er so geworden ist. In Manchester trifft er unter anderem seine Ex-Frau wieder und dessen neuen Freund.

Manchester by the Sea ist ein trauriges Drama. Der Film thematisiert den Umgang mit dem Verlust von Familienmitgliedern. Lees Geschichte ist sehr traurig anzusehen und es ist nachvollziehbar, warum er so geworden ist. Die ersten zehn Minuten sehen wir ihn in Boston, wie er seinem Job nachgeht und er schüchtern ist und Probleme dabei hat neue Leute kennenzulernen und dass er ein Alkoholproblem hat. Ich finde Lee, trotz seiner Probleme sympathisch und kann mich in ihn hineinversetzen. Die Beziehung zwischen ihm und seinem Neffen geht auf Distanz, weil er Angst hat, noch jemanden zu verlieren. Der Soundtrack ist überragend, vor allem in den emotionalen Momenten. Casey Affleck hat zu Recht den Oscar als bester Hauptdarsteller gewonnen. Der Cast generell ist super ausgewählt und man kann jede Figur nachvollziehen. Manchester by the Sea ist ein schöner, emotionaler Film, welcher einen berührt und über die Familiensituation nachdenken lässt. Der Film zeigt, dass es schlechte Familien gibt, man sich trotzdem ändern kann.

Featuring a great script and outrageously natural acting, this movie possesses absolutely no schlock, pulls no punches, and sacrifices balancing its mood in favour of displaying unprecedented levels of existential cruelty.

Though this movie possesses a certain subtle beauty in its narrative, at its core, it generally depicts a cynical apathy that is punctuated by the loudest kind of bitter suffering. The beauty lies within its bleakness, which can make it as powerful as it is difficult to watch.

While not a movie with general appeal, Manchester by the Sea's bold display of uninterrupted pain and suffering is laudable, and is worth watching for those who can manage to bear witness to the on-screen cruelty it often demonstrates."

There may be those out there who find that this film drags in certain parts, however the cleverly executed non-linear plot and near-flawless performances of conflict, hate and sly humour from the likes of Casey Affleck (who is now my favourite for the Oscar) makes 'Manchester by the Sea' one of the most gritty and emotionally-reverent dramas of recent years.

With a plot that dashes backwards and forwards, Lonergan has crafted an intense and almost shocking plot that gradually builds Affleck's character through the clever use of flashbacks and disguised thrills. Affleck has slowly been proving himself as an acting body to be commended, and this film has finally given us his most complex performance to date, that of a man on a path of self-inflicted emotional trauma. A film that hits hard and leaves a lasting impression."

But dear god, nothing quite like Manchester by the Sea. My sister saw it first and explained it as “It starts as the saddest movie you’ve ever seen, and then halfway through, it sinks into another level of incomprehensible despair.” I am paraphrasing. But she is correct. At every plot turn, Kenneth Lonergan takes the road less travelled and much more depressing. The writing and screenplay work together in perfect emotional harmony, highlighted by the quietly dynamic performances by Casey Affleck, Lucas Hedges, and one spectacular scene by Michelle Williams that left me crying into a dirty scarf from the bottom of my purse. This movie isn’t about redemption, it’s about surviving and self-preservation, in spite of the most horrific thing you could ever imagine, and despite what others may need from you. 8.7/10"

It's realistic, sad, and depressing. With 137 minutes runtime, i can't find any boring moment from this movie. Casey Affleck successfully elevates this movie with his quiet, and charming persona. For the first 60 minutes, you'll probably hate his character. But after that, you'll feel sad to his character and maybe you'll love him. Because how Lonergan represent Casey's character and give us a reason why his character hate this life is really touching in my opinion. Not all directors can build a character like that.  And Casey executes it beautifully. Michelle, Hedges, and surprisingly CJ Wilson is also successfully bring their characters to life. Lonergan's decision to deliver the message from this movie with a slow but realistic act, is a masterpiece.  The dialogue in this movie is so natural. There are no cheesy nor overly dramatic lines in this film. Which i love it. This movie proves that Lonergan is a fantastic director and writer. I'm glad this movie won the Oscar for Original Screenplay and Actor in a leading role. Affleck is really, really joining the ranks of giants."

Director Kenneth Lonergan wants to show the real depths to sadness and grief. This doesn't include wallowing in it but instead living with it in the most mundane ways possible.

In that sense, Casey Affleck is perfectly cast. Some actors transform for their roles, some actors are born only for certain roles they already fit. This is probably the latter, though it's no less remarkable for being so. This isn't Affleck playing himself, but instead doing a soul-search within himself to play a variation of the kind of characters he was born to play. We are all the better for it. Lucas Hedges and Michelle Williams also do great work.

Lonergan finds a way to capture without exclamation all the ways in which a person can be ruined, without even being a bad person, while still dealing with everyday life. He's changed, but the world hasn't, and it won't just for him. This sounds depressing, and it can be, and it sounds nihilistic, which it's not. There is light in this, if you look, which is really the key after all."

First of all it was not based on any book, but you can see that book kind of effect in the storytelling. One of the best original screenplay, I won't be surprised if it wins the Oscars for that. I actually struggled in the opening to catch the storyline. Because the past and present overlapped while sharing the presentation alternatively. But it was about the present with flashbacks popping out regularly to join the tale by comparing/revealing the earlier events. So after few occasions, I got used to it and enjoyed my rest of the watch.

I always love good drama films. But not all the drama films I have seen are the masterpiece. So despite it was received so well from all the quarters, I kept my expectations low. The initial parts were okay, but its only during the final stage I begin to like it more. Especially the Casey's performance. I have seen him in many great films, in the big roles, but I think this one is his best, particularly from the positive perspective of the character he had played. Looks like the decade belongs to Affleck brothers. They have given great performances recently and acted in the great films that will be remembered for a long time.

This is the story of the Lee, a man who works as a janitor. One day he receives a call that his brother had passed away as he was suffering from the illness for a some time. Since his brother got divorced, all the responsibility comes under his belt, including his teenage son. Now those two struggles to join the force, but somehow manages all. Meanwhile, till the conclusion, the Lee's life before that point were disclosed to us, like how he struggled in his own life before coming to end in the current situation.

I could be wrong, but Casey Affleck's going to win the Oscars for his performance. Andrew Garfield is the other guy standing between his chance. I'll be happy whoever wins between them. I like Michelle Williams, but her Oscars nominee is meaningless. What, she appeared for 10-15 minutes in the entire narration which can be tagged as a guest appearance than a full fledged role. This is a fine drama, one of the year's best, deserved all the Oscars nod it got. Surely worth a watch and I recommend it.

 Initially, I had to embrace the formal, almost rigid staging, look more closely, peek beneath the surface—just like with a painting, where hidden emotions only reveal themselves through active observation. What is shown, and what is left out?

Director Celine Sciamma's latest may be a joy to look at, and its content may indeed constitute an earnest, heartfelt feminine manifesto, but it often comes across as somewhat tentative and restrained in going all-out for what it really wants to say (especially with a title that includes the words ""on fire"" in it). To be sure, this is a fine piece of filmmaking in many regards, but rising to the level of ""masterpiece"" sincerely requires more than what's served up here."

A French movie, it's a slow movie, art - subtle drama. Each moment in the movie builds up to the next moment of the movie. Half way through, there's one particular scene that makes audience feel totally worth it and goosebumps during the scene and also builds anticipation for further narrative. Silences and nuances convey deep emotions without even putting anything out there outright. Although the intention and the story of the movie is debatable varying person to person, this movie will be a textbook reference for every film making aspect. I could write a never ending essay on it.

It is easily my favorite film of 2020 to date. (yes I'm counting it as a 2020 release even though it had a tiny release in December 2019 okay wow) This is a film that showcases the raw might and devastation embodied by forbidden love.  I don't think I have been so moved by a romance in film since 2018's Call Me By Your Name. I feel that the amount of emotion this film is able to evoke results from fully drawn characters, patient, exacting performances, gorgeous lighting, and purposeful cinematography.


The way this script reveals its characters' personalities and histories is through the brief and extremely femininely coded interactions between each of them. So much is accomplished by the writing and performances in so little dialogue that both the characters and the audience are given quite an allowance of time to fully soak in the weight of each and every line. Shots will linger on each of the main characters as they act and react to each other in a way that achieves significant tension and suspense, especially for a film in the romance genre. That suspense is only heightened by how this film is lit and shot. Between the beautiful French cliff-side beach and the surprisingly warm castle home, the main locations this film takes place in provide ample opportunities for visually stunning shots, all of which were seized and all of which directly aligned with the script. Honestly, I was gushing for most of the movie over just how effectively the language of the camera was being used. It felt similar to Parasite in that way. With that review and comparison, I don't think my rating here should come as any shock. PoaLoF is on Hulu right now and it is definitely worth a watch."

Bringing the audience's eyes towards the eyes, noses, and other facial features of Heloise and Marianna, the texture is a very present part of the film. The costume design, the acting, the cinematography, the direction, the score, and most of all, the Art direction were through the roof. With matching images to Bergman's Persona, stellar direction for an even more stellar screenplay, I can't praise this film enough.

The use of score reminds me of Miyazaki's embedding of Hisahashi's music into his films. Not gonna write much more on the themes of the film as I just wrote this blob of text to fill in a rating.

243,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,KeithDow,"Mar 18, 2020",8,"Nearly every scene in Céline Sciamma’s ‘Portrait of a Lady on Fire’ can be frozen in time, mounted on canvas, and hung on a wall for display.  There’s a deep, rich luxuriousness to the film, from the cinematography to the acting to the story itself, making it ever so deserving of winning the **** Palm and Best Screenplay award at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.

The ethereal, hovering camera work evokes the essence of a Terrance Malick film.  Considering Sciamma both wrote and directed ‘Portrait,’ her budding career shows no less promise.

Noémie Merlant plays protagonist Marianne, an artist tasked with painting the wedding portrait of Héloïse, played by Adèle Haenel.  Héloïse mustn’t know Marianne’s true intentions as the bride-to-be is emotionally fraught, having suffered through the recent suicide of her sister along with a stint in a convent.  The notion of being married off to some Milanese nobleman in a sudden and emotionless marriage may simply be too much to bear.

As the cat-and-mouse interplay unfolds, Marianne and Héloïse bond, creating an emotional connection  flecked with romantic leanings.  It’s within this raw passionate atmosphere that the story lingers, offering the audience a meditative mood piece that draws our own emotions into a deep, sensory-rich trance.

Though the pacing of ‘Portrait of a Lady on Fire’ is slow, it is necessary to achieve the hypnotic nature of the film.  In capturing this deliberate rhythm, which is essential to the period and plot, Sciamma is able to fully realize the lingering memory of lovers long past into something vibrantly and excitingly new."

246,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Sierra-117,"Mar 6, 2020",9,"Portrait of a lady on fire is a French romance/historical drama from the capable hands of Céline Sciamma, who crafts this meticulous, tantalizing tale of an artist who falls in love with the woman she is assigned to paint. Unlike the typical romance, the film takes a more gradual approach to building a dynamic between each of the characters, which ultimately makes the events that follow all the more meaningful. In Some ways you could say it’s the polar opposite to a romance like James Cameron’s Titanic, which I’ll have you know I’m not especially fond of. This is because in my opinion it (Titanic) rushes the development of the protagonists’ relationship in order to create an illusion of ‘Star crosses lovers’ . In some instances I don’t mind this, such as when used in Romcoms, but in the case of a serious film like Titanic I believe it is extremely out of place. This is one of the reasons why I enjoyed Portrait of a Lady on Fire so much. Rather than rush into the romantic elements, it demands your patience, which in turn is rewarded to a satisfactory extent. One of the ways that Sciamma builds tension between Noémie Merlant’s ‘Marianne’ and Adèle Haenel’s ‘Héloïse’, is that during moments of interest she tends to linger on each of their faces, long enough for the average viewer to decipher their emotions and watch how they alter after certain changes. Of course this does almost entirely depend on the cast’s ability to display said emotions, and fortunately each actress plays their part beautifully. The cinematography is also incredible, with some absolutely stunning shots of vastly different scenery, and although music is used sparingly, when it’s utilized it perfectly contributes to the atmosphere. My one small gripe with this film is that often there is a meaningful scene that feels hastily cut off in order to continue with the plot. Although many people won’t mind this I would’ve personally preferred if they had lasted a tad longer.
In conclusion, Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a phenomenal film that echoes the directors passion, and due to a stellar cast, brilliant writing and amazing cinematography I give it a 9/10"

Directed by Raoul Peck and narrated by Samuel L. Jackson, the film presents vast amounts of archival footage from the civil rights era, juxtaposed against modern day representations of racial conflict, in which both the past and present are contextualized by the words of writer James Baldwin.

Given that the source material is nearly 40 years old, many of Baldwin’s thoughts and opinions on the black experience in America ought to feel dated, yet the overall feeling leaving the theater isn't about how far we've come, but how much farther we still have to go."

There are elements of a traditional doc in this film, but it's more an artistic treatise using Baldwin's eloquent words (quietly voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) and charismatic on-screen appearances to delineate his musings on the subject. It's supported with disturbing historical photos and excerpts from Hollywood films. There is a focus on 3 great leaders of the civil rights movement (Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King), but the extended analysis sometimes becomes repetitive or seems to ramble. Even so, this is a forceful examination that sadly still rings true more than 50 years later."
261,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-am-not-your-negro/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Feb 10, 2017",7,"(Disclosure--not full: I met James Baldwin at the 92nd Street YMCA in NYC just after his second book ""Giovanna's Room"" was published and he was participating on a panel for what was very rare at that time talking about gay sex, black men and women in the 1950s none of the  3 related to each other. At that time he was friends with Marlon Brando and Wally Cox and I had lived next door to the former and when he saw me he hugged me and asked me to join them for  a bite to eat afterwards. For awhile I became part of their circle though I certainly was on the outer circle!)

With all that said after he went to live in Paris I didn't see him nor when he came back so I didn't know too much about his last book that wasn't finished when he died and Director Raoul Peck decided to make this documentary using Baldwin's words, and public appearances, to finish the book.

James Baldwin knew Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Junior, and all 4 men, in the 1970s, wrote and spoke about events that took place many decades before and, unaware, all talked about events that are taking place today.

""I Am Not Your Negro"" is an in your face look at race relations in our country from day one until today and though it is Oscar nominated it would be better seen on HBO or PBS or showed in classrooms for all ages.

I do hope whoever sees this will be lead to the readings of James Baldwin's from his ""Go Tell It On The Mountain"" to ""Giovanni's Room"", ""The Fire Next Time"", ""Notes Of A Native Son"", ""Another Country"" just to name a few that will have you entertained, moved, educated and intrigued."

It is so sad that there are so many people in this country who hate people because they are black or because they are white or because they are gay or because they have the audacity to challenge existing societal norms.  One of the most amazing things about Baldwin that I got from this film is that he, unlike other outspoken civil rights leaders of the 1960s, is that he didn't hate white people.  He just saw what was so obvious to him then, and is obvious to me now, that there are many ignorant people who hate other people based on their skin color, ethnicity or religion.  This film was so powerful to me that I watched another documentary about him the next day and I am now reading Baldwin.

Gazing each other across the room or touching someone for the first time or even talk about them to someone else is depicted as electrifying as it is in real life and this is something that very few of them can achieve. Carol is a suave and mild love story that is too practical to be a film and still Todd Haynes pulls it off with Phyllis Nagy's smart adaptation from the novel with enough drama for the audience to rely upon for 2 whole hours. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are the keys that withholds the audience throughout the movie with a great supporting cast like Sarah Paulson and Kyle Chandler.

The lovely character of Carol will easily slay you, and Rooney Mara's crying in the train is one of the saddest moments of the movies in memory, one that so many can relate to."
298,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/carol/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Spangle,"Oct 21, 2016",9,"Carol is undeniably a revelation. A subtle romantic film, Carol's power is exquisitely defined in the expression on Therese Belivet's (Rooney Mara) face upon seeing Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) for the first time. The look of love at first sight, as if Carol were the answer to questions Therese had been subconsciously asking her whole life, the film's beauty and elegance is defined in that look. This film is the answer to the question: What is the most authentic romance film in years? Though I may not be gay or a woman, the romance here transcends any false boundary between humanity. In this, director Todd Haynes crafts a truly universal romance film that is for the entire world to behold in awe.

The same look on Therese's face is shared by Carol at the very end. As Therese walks slowly over to her and Haynes expertly uses slow motion to emphasize the moment, the look of subtle peace and joy highlights what this film does so well. It is not a teenage romance in any way. It is not excessive. It is not over-the-top. It is not cinematic love. Rather, it has a raw authenticity that is truly impossible to ignore. Instead, it consumes you and absorbs the viewer into this lush world that makes you experience the same love and pain as the characters.

This authenticity is translated into the screenplay, which is a thoroughly poetic and moving experience. The characters of Therese and Carol are so well defined, it is as if they are real human beings and this is merely their tale. The real emotions of love, pain, joy, and hurt, demonstrated by these women is impactful to the very core. However, its real success comes in the dialogue. Therese constantly shooting down Richard (Jake Lacy) and his offers to go away to Europe with him, while immediately accepting an offer to go away with Carol. The encounter between Carol and Harge (Kyle Chandler), in which Carol explains how having her daughter only for a short amount of time and being true to herself is better for her daughter than having her all the time and ""living against her own grain"". Carol not only is a revelation for its power in terms of LGBT romance, but also in its communication of its character's feelings. Instead of explicitly telling you how they feel, it leaves it open for you to pick up on their intentions. Above all of other elements, this is what makes the film feel so authentic. They act and speak like real human beings who express their feelings, but not directly. These women leave bread crumbs for the viewer to figure out what really makes them tick. Not only does this indicate incredible trust given to the audience by Haynes, but it also highlights his trust in the writing and the actors to convey meaning.

Visually, the film is equally as stunning. Cinematographer Edward Lachman's camera is a magnet for beautiful shots. The heavy reliance upon reflections and mirrors is what truly caught my attention the most, especially when considering when they are utilized and the overall meaning of the film. Carol, above all, is a film about being true to one's self. Carol could have stayed with Harge and kept her daughter. Therese could have married Richard. Yet, neither felt truly satisfied in that life when without one another. Lachman captures this in his use of reflections. In one particular sequence, Therese goes with Carol to visit her home, with Richard bidding Therese goodbye before she leaves. As they drive, reflections abound. Symbolically, this most closely represents the double life being led by these women. A mirror merely reflects who you are, but is not you true self. It is other. This reflection is Therese's life with Richard. The camera then juxtaposes these shots with her in the car with Carol, highlighting how that is her true self. She is meant to be with Carol and it is her path to happiness.

Lachman and Haynes also use a notable color scheme for the entire film, with many shots being covered with an apparent green filter. These shots are accented by the heavy use of brown, red, and yellow. Interestingly, when Carol first visits with Therese, she is wearing red. However, after her daughter is taken from her and the two women see each other once more, it is Therese wearing red. As red often represents passion, one must assume that this is foreshadowing. Initially, Carol was the one pursuing this relationship. Therese knew she was infatuated with her, but was not confident enough to pursue her. Carol, meanwhile, had experience in the area and did pursue her. However, once her daughter leaves, she is more concerned with being reunited with her daughter, not being with Therese. The opposite is true for Therese, who has blossomed and is filled with passion and wonderous feelings for Carol.

Finally, the cherry on top of the film is score. Carter Burwell's score hits all the right notes and truly highlights the setting and feelings of the film. This is a very cozy and warm film. The colors certainly highlight this as well, as does the setting"

This is the most beautiful film of the year. Visually stunning masterpiece, very atmospheric, and this movie is about love, no matter what happens or even exists. We really DID see on-screen Love.

Fulfilled with deep and emotional performances by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara (probably even their best performances to date) and composition softly directed by Todd Haynes, Carol is emotionally overwhelming, really. A beautiful score by Carter Burwell is like the third main character as it complements the whole composition with its beauty and richness. Costumes and cinematography are Oscar-worthy as well, and the ending is very emotional in its own way.

The movie is not about lesbianism, it's all about love. The real one.

It's a shame that Carol wasn't nominated for Best Picture, but it's complicated for Academy."
302,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/carol/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"Mar 4, 2016",7,"Just when it can't get any better...

The first thing I noticed was after seeing the movie is there's some kind of mistake in the Oscars nominee. Rooney Mara should have been on the lead role list, while Cate Blanchett in the supporting character's. Maybe the Academy people misunderstood that the title role must be the lead character. Theirs switched place actually does not make any sense. Anyway the Oscars never made sense at all.

This story was okay, but adapted screenplay and direction, especially the music was excellent. For the ending scene alone, you will be tempted to raise your rating than what you initially thought it deserves. I was not expecting the movie to be awesome, so I'm not upset for the overall movie.

Believe me, the last thing I want in this movie is to see Cate Blanchett in naked. Maybe out of respect or her age or she's not attracted to me, there are plenty of reasons that I can't figure it out which one, but after knowing what this theme is, I was only praying for that not to happen. And obviously that is unavoidable, otherwise the movie will lose its soul and strength.

Well, it was better than I thought, both the actresses were good, but Rooney Mara dominated. Whatever category she's in for the Oscars, I'll be happy if she wins. It is not a must watch, but a decent movie and betters in some parts.

304,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/carol/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,ydnar4,"Feb 28, 2016",7,Carol is a well crafted film. Both Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett are well cast and both deserved their Oscar nominations. Your eye is just drawn to Blanchett throughout the movie and I think that she is the real star of the film even though Mara may actually get more screen time overall. Todd Haynes direction is great as well and although the time the film is based in is the 1950's it doesn't take over the story. It looks great and you feel like you are in the 50's but you far more drawn to the two actresses. I thought that the music was Oscar worthy also. It is a bit of a boring film though and there are some points where I had a difficult time paying attention. The only other small problem I had with Carol was Kyle Chandler's role was almost supposed to be villainous but he really wasn't that bad of a person. There can still be some enjoyment in this as well.

Thus is lit a long slow fuse whose detonation is accordingly all the more cathartic.  This is not to say, though, that the love affair does not get started until well into the movie.  It is to Haynes’s credit, and that of his actresses, that the depth of feeling within the pair is throughout the film clearly conveyed, but by actions and words denoting no more than a subtle regard.   In fact, though it requires some patience for much of its length, this may be one of the better screen portrayals of an intense affair that I can remember.  Fans of this film should check out Haynes’s huge critical hit from 2002, ""Far from Heaven.""  (Personally, I like the current film better, though.)"

This movie is set in 1950s and it follows Carol and Therese who form a bond,after meeting in a department store,and they soon begin to fall in love with each other but that is followed by complicated consequences.
I really did not think much of this movie,the stars do a pretty fine job especially Cate Blanchett but unfortunately I did not find Rooney Mara's performance to be nowhere near as good as some have suggested.Overall I would say this is an overrated movie that got a lot of buzz,which in my opinion came with the leading stars being female and the subject touching on the lesbian matter (and consequences of the time period that the movie takes place).
The story became predictable by the end,the direction was not very good either simply because the way that the director chose to display this movie out has already been done before many times.
However, I did love the score though,as it made some not-so-well made scenes have more weight to them and also gave the dialogue a little much needed punch.Also, the cinematography and the scenery is beautiful throughout as the 1950s come to life on the big screen in an amazing way.
I was bored in some parts and also had quite a few issues but all in all this is a well made and good looking/well acted movie enough to get a pass as a GOOD movie (but not much else)."

However, I think given the time, and even now, the behavior of the characters are completely understandable and realistic. It hurts when someone leaves you, no matter what the reason. The male characters were following their interest just like the two primary female characters.

Given that, everything about this movie was prefect to me."

310,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/carol/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Barracuda89,"Jan 25, 2016",10,"It’s not often that a film like Carol comes along. A film so beautifully shot, about such important subject matter, so flawlessly acted; leaving one in a state of shock after the first time they have seen it. Such an important film, Carol is one that will restore your faith in the current state of cinema. In the age of Hollywood blockbusters, simply trying to fill seats with copious amounts of action, it is reassuring that a work of true film art, such as Carol, is still being so exceptionally made.

To pose the claim that Carol is one-dimensional could not be farther from the truth. Love, self, society, and sacrifice are explored in the film Carol; issues which affect each individual. Passively observing her life unfold, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) exists as an unfulfilled being in all aspects of her life. Living in a shabby New York apartment which she cannot even afford to adequately heat, Therese stumbles through her daily existence. Riding on the handlebars of her insipid “boyfriend” to her daily work at a department store where she is reduced to just another holiday hat wearing drone, it is clear to see that Therese is unhappy with the dull ache that has become her life. Finding refuge in her photographs, Therese escapes her unhappiness and finds fulfillment in honing her photography talents. One magical day changes the course of Therese’s mundane existence. A stunningly classic beauty exuding wealth named Carol (Cate Blanchett) happens upon Therese’s display at the department store. There is moving art in their exchange, as one can soon pick up on the discontent Carol projects ever so subtlety.  Carol Aird is a prisoner of her own life; stuck in a loveless marriage, mother to a child she adores, Carol is living proof that even when one enjoys great wealth, as she does, happiness can still only be an illusion. Sharing a mutual distaste for their own lives and harboring feelings they themselves were often too afraid to feel, Carol and Therese set out on to travel; to escape their glum realities, even temporarily. As the two continue their quest, protected by isolation, their inhibitions dissipate, and they begin to explore the loving reality that is their relationship. The internal struggle of being a married lesbian mother in the early 1950’s proves too much for Carol to bear, as she abandons the trip and returns home to fight for custody of her daughter against her imposing husband Harge (Kyle Chandler) Devastated at the seeming end to the purposeful existence she has so longed for, Therese finds it impossible to return to her normal work at the department store. Invigorated by a new sense of purpose, Therese channels her pain in her pictures, taking a job at a newspaper where she can explore photography full-time. Carol also finds it intolerable to return to her prior life; renewed with strength, Carol finally stands up to Harge, vowing to never again go against her grain. Carol is what she is, whether society approves or not, and after she realizes that, there may be hope yet for true love.

Based on the novel The Price of Salt, by Patricia Highsmith, Carol is beautifully photographed against the seminal images of life in the 1950’s. Edward Lachman’s cinematography work on this film is nothing short of poetic, as the audience is guided deeper and deeper into the crux of forbidden love in the “good ole’ days”. Cate Blanchett turns out a career best performance as the titular character defined by the society she is a part of, yet wants nothing to do with. Rooney Mara’s performance of a young girl learning about even the suppressed facets of her own self was stellar. The direction of Todd Haynes was extraordinary in delivering such a raw, relentless love, told almost exclusively through subtlety. Powerfully shot with a heavy reliance on filming through windows or opposite mirrors, Haynes allows the audience to explore how much of their selves can only be viewed from within, and how much of a distorted display our true self is when exposed to those around us. Accompanied by a powerful score, Carol is a masterpiece to be viewed the world over for its brilliance in capturing feelings so relatable to everyday life within the human condition.

Brilliantly written, with remarkable production design and costumes, Carol is the most beautiful film I’ve seen in years. A truly intoxicating experience; if given the chance, Carol transforms the viewer to a place where it is not ok to be who you are meant to be, and on some level, everyone can relate to this feeling. A rare form of near perfection is captured on screen through Todd Haynes’ masterwork. Carol is a film that should be enjoyed by masses for years to come."

Cate Blanchett's performance was beyond words.... stunning!  The subtlety of the acting, the ever present nuances are the predominant features that sets this movie apart from any other I have seen, and may ever see again.  The juxtaposition of the ever present menace from society and even family against a sublimely enacted love story creates both tension and passion.

The romance between the two leads works with Mara especially shining.  What’s notable isn’t just what is said but what isn’t said. How while Mara doesn’t say much the camera speaks for her both the diegetic one she holds and the non-diegetic one. It is the construction of the various shots to the tell the story that almost make this something special. Had the film just clarified the various relationships it could’ve been great. Nonetheless, it is still a well made film and the fact that exists shows how far we’ve come. While such a romance may have happened in an earlier time period it is only recently that we are at a point where we can show it."

Director Todd Haynes has beautifully crafted a period world, while masterfully capturing the longing and frustration of their relationship.

It's gorgeously shot, has great, expertly-crafted production, costume designs, etc, and of course has wonderful performances from Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. However, with that being said, I found myself a bit underwhelmed in terms of the story and its development as the film went on. I felt as though it could've found a slightly better balance between the plot point of Carol fighting for her daughter and the main plot point of the romance between the two leads. It works very well emotionally but lacks any true emotional punch. However, I will say that the best scenes in the film were the ones between Blanchett and Mara, who work wonderfully together and their on-screen relationship felt genuine and beautiful. All credit goes to them for making the slightly uneven story a little more intriguing and emotional to watch. Overall, despite a sometimes unsure and uneven story, the film is beautifully set up and Blanchett and Mara's performances are easy the film's strongest aspects."

Sexual atttraction, yes, we get it - over & over & over.  (I felt the pace in general was too slow).

But mostly, I just wanted to know these characters better, especially Therese.  Who was she, as a young woman, beyond her sexual preference?  There's no dialogue that fills us in.  Being ""flung from space"" might've been good enough for Carol but it wasn't for me. Despite the movie's critical acclaim for its authentic depiction of the damage done by homophobia, I have to say that it sells Therese short by having her lesbianism standing in for everything she was.  It pretty much summed her up, and what kind of ""message"" is that?  (I thought Mara's acting was stilted, but it may have had more to do with her role being so underwritten.)

There's also the absence of any consideration of class; how did Carol's wealth play into the attraction?  That mink!  That palatial home!  This was a way into the character that was never developed.  Also, the issue of Carol being threatened with losing custody of her daughter is there, and I doubt Highsmith felt very connected to it emotionally, so it wasn't necessary to do more with it, in an adaptation; but if something were to be ""run with,"" I would've liked more about it than what's there in this film.  A beat near the end, maybe, to remind us of it?

I read the book it was based on, and have to say, I liked it better, because it wasn't trying to be gorgeous.  It felt more real.  This movie certainly was gorgeous, and Cate Blanchett was perfect  - stunning at times, especially that last shot of her.   But, overall, I came away wishing there had been more substance, and that's not what I'd wanted to feel."

It is beautiful, and I certainly do miss that feeling."
324,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/carol/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,FilmPhonic,"Jan 5, 2016",7,"It’s probably controversial in today’s political climate to say that a gay love story is unconventional, but given the 1950s social climate in which the story is set, ‘Carol’ is very much that, as was Patricia Highsmith’s source novel which was published at the time in question.

There’s no doubt that the nature of a lesbian relationship in the 50s is a driving factor for the narrative in ‘Carol’, as Highsmith’s original book soft-cover claimed, this is “The novel of a love society forbids”.
But the careful and considered treatment that’s given to the story, plus masterful craftsmanship by director Todd Haynes, means that you quickly move past a gay love story into a non-traditional yet familiar and tender relationship drama which most adult audiences will relate to.

The irrepressible Cate Blanchett stars in the titular role as woman in repressed turmoil who struggles to balance her character with her family obligations and societal constraints, a distinguished and subtle performance that’s a perfect counterpoint to her Oscar-winning turn in ‘Blue Jasmine’. Rooney Mara also delivers a strong measured performance as an equally uncertain “Therese Belivet”, a girl struggling with youth-related inner turmoil, and who is the catalyst for “Carol’s” inner revolution.

Much has been made of the visual stylishness of the film and indeed the achievements of the cinematographers and costume designers deserve the praise they’re receiving. By rejecting digital and choosing to shoot in 16mm film, Todd Haynes has achieved a vivid colour palette and texture that’s faithful to the cinematic aesthetic of the period in which it’s set.

‘Carol’ carefully walks the line between a tender romance and a melodrama, occasionally stepping over that line with convenient and unlikely story turns and characters that are mostly one-note, apart from the leads. Indeed the narrative is unbalanced with everything revolving around “Carol” while simultaneously portraying characters that no matter how understated, are all fundamentally self-centered. In that sense ‘Carol’ has distinct 21st century characteristics.

Despite strong and subtle performances from the leads and a commendable attempt at a realist depiction of a period romance, regardless of sexuality, the central love story is beautiful but just not that compelling.

The Bottom Line…
Director Todd Haynes has managed to beautifully craft a subtle period-piece romance about “forbidden” love that backs away from melodrama and delivers a universally relatable narrative, despite some character flaws and a slightly underwhelming core courtship."

I thought it was a bit of a shame that there's no additional information about the singers life given alongside the performances - I suppose I assume that music documentaries will include more than 'just' the music itself but that's not to say that it's not a good, uplifting, entertaining and enjoyable musical performance because it is.

333,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/amazing-grace-1972/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MarkHReviews,"Apr 19, 2019",9,"“Amazing Grace” is a revelation.  That this documentary even exists is a miracle.

In January, 1972, a 29-year-old Aretha Franklin recorded a live gospel album.  Over two days, with the help of Rev. James Cleveland (himself a well-known gospel singer), the Southern California Community Choir and the studio musicians who had helped make her the Queen of Soul on Atlantic Records, Aretha recorded at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Watts, Los Angeles.  “Amazing Grace,” the resulting album, became the best-selling gospel recording of all time.

The songs selected for the album, and indirectly the film, are an eclectic blend.  They include traditional gospel hymns, a mash-up of Carole King’s “You’ve Got a Friend” with the gospel tune “Precious Lord,” Marvin Gaye’s “Wholy Holy.”  With my Baptist upbringing, I was literally sobbing throughout “What a Friend We Have in Jesus” and “Amazing Grace” – with Aretha in full flight, the choir in full-throated response and the audience in rapture.  In fairness, my wife, one of the more empathic souls on the planet, was completely dry-eyed and found the film “an interesting anthropology lesson.”  So your experience may vary.

Sensing that something magical was about to happen during these recording sessions, Warner Brothers studio (which owned Atlantic Records) hired director Sidney Pollack to document the proceedings.  With five cameramen, he recorded every moment.  The result was over twenty hours of audio recording and over 1500 video scenes, including shots of Mick Jagger standing, clapping and singing (the Stones were in LA to record “Exile on Main Street”).  The structure of this documentary is quite bare-bones. There are almost no side conversations, no voiceovers for context and no interviews with any of the participants.  This austere structure allows Pollack and his crew to focus on the most important task – capturing Aretha singing at the height of her powers, often in extreme close-up.

Now on to the miraculous part.  Presumably because they were filming and recording a live performance, Pollack and his crew never “slated the scenes” (using the wood clapper to mark the beginning of the upcoming scene).  In 1972, slating the scene was the only way to accurately sync 16mm video with the audio, which came from two different sources.  After months of effort, including hiring Choir Director Alexander Hamilton for $200/week to lip-read some of the video, producers decided this problem was insurmountable.  The project was abandoned and the materials shelved for decades.

In 2007, Producer Alan Elliott purchased the raw footage from Warner Brothers, unaware of the syncing problem.  Fortunately, what was impossible in 1972 could by then be conquered through digitization.  However, because the tapes had sat in a basement unattended for over 35 years, they first had to be “re-baked” (literally placed in an oven and heated to over 130 degrees) so they would not disintegrate while being digitally processed.  The finally-synced footage was edited into the final version of the documentary by 2015.  For reasons unknown, Aretha then sued to block release.  Only after a screening for Franklin’s family following Aretha’s death last year did her estate eventually allow the film to be shown publicly.

So, this documentary is forty-seven years in the making, but wow, was it worth the wait.  “Amazing Grace” – how sweet the sound!"

However, while the picture is somewhat typical of concert films of the day, it comes across as somewhat amateurish by contemporary standards (unfocused cinematography, choppy editing, inconsistent sound quality, etc., material quite surprising from a director like Sydney Pollack).

Abandoning the more experimental themes he toyed with in Inception and Interstellar, Christopher Nolan has set out to make a mostly-straight war picture, shining his spotlight on a major test (and ultimate turning point) for the British armed forces. Told from three entangled perspectives - one each from land, sea and air - we see heroes, victims, cowards and lunatics emerge from what might have otherwise seemed a nondescript group of frightened young men.

Dunkirk is far less bombastic than the standard combat film, with a soft, observant character and distinct lack of extraneous dialogue. That reticence, paired with an emphasis on beautifully-composed photography, reminded me more of an art film than an action epic. The battlefield's thick tension is inescapable, though, always drawing us back to the moment, with the wary skyward eyes and skittish, shell-shocked nature of nearby soldiers proving a constant reminder that arbitrary death could be mere moments away. It’s also the rare positive example of a recent tendency toward uneven sound mixes: a barrage of gunfire or sudden, screaming airborne bombing run can pack a mighty punch."

And boy oh boy was I happy to be surprised! Nolan crafted not a tale, story, or insight into a tiny aspect of the war. But successfully detected a literal experience, not telling, showing, and dramatizing what happened but simply depicting the events that unfolded while emphasizing the already very enticing literal events that unfolded at Dunkirk. 

By using simple yet effective plot devices and strong characters Christopher Nolan did not craft a film but an experience of what was.

A film that shows the war scenario around the evacuation success of over 300,000 mainly British and French soldiers on the last line of defense around Dunkirk. Basically the many soldiers were waiting there to be taken over to the island by ship. You had the advancing armed forces of the **** behind you and the Luftwaffe above your heads.

The film mainly stages the psychologically stressful accessories of a war or a single war scenario. The constant fear of every single soldier has been conveyed (mostly) well and you have had one or two goose bumps here. So it is not shown in the very classic sense of ""war"", but much more the surrounding area. Various impressions underline the sheer fear in the soldiers' thoughts.

For me, the very impressive presentation resulted mainly from the parallelism of the scenes, which are then put together from different perspectives, underlaid with suitable sound and good music. The sound design in particular was very haunting and threatening, especially due to the dive fighter planes, and it conveyed the situation very well.

Dunkirk is a film about survival. The evacuation process is focused on the air, sea and beach sections in the film. These subdivisions of the film are represented by different actors (e.g. Tom Hardy in a Spitfire). But especially with the soldiers, I would have liked to have had more time in Dunkirk to portray the psychological stress even more drastically on film. Unfortunately, this part was dealt with very quickly and right at the beginning.

A total of 4/5 evacuation boats."

'Dunkirk', as you'd expect given the director, is extremely well made. I particularly enjoyed how the film is shot, the sound editing and the score. It's a watchable story about an event from World War II.

I wouldn't, personally, say there's a standout cast performer. I don't mean that negatively, it's just more a film about a group of people rather than individuals - which I assume was the intention. There are still good performances, from the likes of Tom Glynn-Carney and Jack Lowden. It also features star names, including Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy and Mark Rylance.

The music and how the sequences are crafted is what elevates this film up, while the pacing is almost spot on - they could easily have made this 2hr 15mins+, like most war films seem to do, but keeping it at around 1hr 47mins was a smart choice.

Every scene in the plane felt tense, the music swells at the perfect times, and the hints of a story feel...disappointing. I can't help but feel that the addition of a more fledged out narrative would only add to the film. Nevertheless, Dunkirk is beautifully crafted and the incredible sound design pulls you into the second world war like no other film has. Yet, I have to recommend other world war 2 films - such as Hacksaw Ridge - as the must watch films instead."

It's about thousands of French and British soldiers stranded on the shore of the french sea town, Dunkirk. There's only one word to describe it-dazzling. The amazing thing is, the movie never shows the enemy, but even then manages to be filled with tension and drama, without any real large scale action sequences. Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is beautiful, and sound and visual effects and great. One of the best war movies of all time"

A strong, growing soundtrack that boosts the atmosphere. Scenes from which there is not enough air is when a whole cruiser goes to the bottom. Terrible things are shown in this film.

The sense of fear and tension built is unlike many other movies and the tense captivating stories really build on the impact of this film. The lack of deep character building is obvious to me but it seems fitting as there wasn't time for that during war and they are just a few out of the 400,000 men.

Knowing of their family members appearance in a movie called Dunkirk is a must know. After the first 10 minutes thought I that I am watching a low cost, amateur movie in a cheap German attempt to copy Hollywood greatness. Then I started counting the actors who all resemble a famous international actor and recognised that they are all family members. At the end was I the low cost amateur watcher trying to copy Hollywood greatness as a consumer. Don't listen to negative reviews of this movie. Alone on an intelligence level and the actor placement is this a must see movie. Which obviously, a view viewers did not get, considering their negative review. Then back to the movie itself. The scenes are nearly all of an immense emotional, dramatic and moral aspect that will stay in mind, they are as thrilling as well as realistic possible in case someone would end in a similar war or conflict position as a soldier. I would nearly say that I had once or twice the feeling that the movie sends an anti war message above everything else, which depends on someones attitude related to war. I personally see war as sometimes necessary to sustain our values and virtues, not to mention for the protection of our freedom. I think that the anti war message was just my emotional reaction due to the perception and how I might feel if I would have been in the position of one of the soldiers. The art and the spirit of this movie is unique and hard to describe. At the end have I not just lifted psychological childhood traumas but got my faith and hope in Hollywood sealed and locked."

The auteur himself, Nolan, has devised a film in an anarchic way as to generate the true story of Dunkirk and deserves Academy Award nominations in all of the categories probable: will he finally receive the Best Director award?

The 330,000 Allied soldiers, who languished on the beaches of Dunkirk, endeavoured to leave the beaches - and they're unremitting masquerade was the catalyst for their deliverance. The picture itself, irrefutably, alludes to the notion that the war was filled with unknown faces, who faced a nefarious crisis; and, the volatility of war, such as death, despondency or hope.

This film is one of the best films I have seen - if not, the best - and its realism and acute nature offers a rigorous outlook of the events that ensued during World War II."

Dunkirk

Why do we end up here? Always? Revisiting the dreadful history. That we started, ended, celebrated and mourned for. It cannot just be a ""quick"" recall. And it shouldn't be that. I may not know the real pulp behind all this passion and necessity but Christopher Nolan, the writer and director, surely tells you, it shouldn't just be a recall. Quick one, surely compared to his other films, but more than an experience and a moral lesson. Poem, it sings and poetic is its run. To me the film felt like a marathon. A sprint, to be precise. ""The mole"" tries to run away from the enemy, the air support towards the enemy but the real heroes, the common man, are kept in hault.

Mid way. They are stretched and strained from the responsibilities of both the kind, the personal and towards the nation. And that is exactly how Nolan pitches this incredibly noble deed by these brave hearts in one lap. Setting the parameters, he never breaks any boundaries for obvious reasons, but hovers very close to the red zone marked in this film. And that is another way how he elevates a most simplistic act or a decision that lives up to the clean soundtrack of Hans Zimmer.

The same year, Steven Spielberg's The Post released which dealt with the similar highly tensed close up shots. But the tension never communicates for no one actually points out or marginalizes the ""normal"" behavior. And in here, Nolan keeps Cilian Murphy to strike fear, a simple meter to explain the stakes of Tom Hardy and a know-it-all Harry Styles to guide Fionn Whitehead. Dunkirk is still at the end of the day comes under the catalogue of Nolan's filmography. He cannot help but whisper secrets if he can in a storyline, I mean he even packs a humorous punch as a big reveal for that scene."

The film is about a man who receives a letter that a body has been found in a glacier and it is that of his ex-girlfriend, who died in a freak accident during his youth and her body presumably lost. This sets off a chain of events that shakes this 45 year marriage to the core. Rampling's character then begins to question everything she knew about her husband and how deep his love for her really is. Especially when he begins to reminisce of his past love and she comes to the bitter realization that she isn't the true love of his life and never was.

This little British romance-drama was not expected by everyone. Without Charlotte Rampling's Oscars nominee for the lead role, it would have been an easily forgotten. Because it is very slow, the story is just okay, but the performances are the saviour IMO. At this age, Charlotte Rampling was looking so good on the screen, her youthful costume was maybe the reason.

The story of a long married couple, the whole movie takes place on the eve of their 45th anniversary celebration. A week to go for their big day, the wife discovers some hidden secret by her hubby. While digging it only gets bigger, but how it would affect their present relationship was told quite interestingly. It was only a single perspective tale, so the detail on the other side are not briefed to us that well. But everything was quite understandable.

In some relationship, some secret needs to be left untouched for good, only if it is not hurting anybody. Life is a long journey if you're an old and to look back your path. What happened a long time ago is not to be judged for the in between timeline events. In someone's perspective, some past incidents are fair. The beauty of this drama is simply lies how smoothly narrated this complicated issue between a husband and wife. Because even if you're not a regular movie goer, still you can name a couple of similar titles, but how unique this was when comparing with those is that's where it betters. It was not so good, but much better in many ways, in its own way.

I thought about The Big Short over the course of the following week to see if I could understand the housing bubble better in my head, I thought about how Room made me feel while I was falling asleep that night after I saw it, but I've thought about the last 10 minutes of 45 Years more than all of the Best Picture Nominees combined. This was one of those movies that lingers in your head so much, The Cranberries could have written a song about it. Let me preface, this movie is only 90 minutes, and the first 80 are so incredibly slow it's like you're being forced to watch How It's Made  in High School P.E., but boy does it pay off. The ending of this movie punches you in the gut with so much futility you'll think Gone Girl had a happy ending. I will also preface this movie is not for people who disapprove of sad endings, this movie can only be described as ""Soul-crushing."" Also, don't bring a date if you want the relationship to last. Couples should have at least 10 years of bliss under their belt, or be confident enough to claim they're the next Niles and Daphne Crane.

Picking  one central character, played by Charlotte Rampling, and having Tom Courtney's grieving husband secondary lessens the depth of the movie. She is shown as the victim, while he comes across as self centered, which makes his grief shallow, thus trying to force us to pick her as the aggrieved one, where in reality both stories deserve our respect. Rampling is very good as the emotions cascading inside her broil under the surface while she struggles with the ever expanding revelations that devestate her."

I, too, go to 50-100 movies a year, most of which we ""screen"" through Metacritic overall scores, unless something else draws us. For example, Woman in Gold was rated orange but we love Helen Mirren and we loved that movie.  My wife is more sensitive to movies like 45 Years than I am, and there were times in the early stages of the film, I sought more ""action"".  That ultimately was naive on my part.  My wife understood the nuances, particularly of Rampling's understated performance far better than I.  I love the Platters, and when ""Smoke Gets in your Eyes"" played, I hummed along instead of carefully listening to the words.  When I got home and googled the lyrics, WOW!  The more reviews I read that night and thought about the movie (I couldn't STOP thinking about it), the more I loved it.  So, do NOT miss this movie and go to it with an open mind, watch very carefully (remember the movie Sixth Sense, and how you had to wanted to watch it again to understand how you could have missed the clues?) or you will miss much.  I think it will be challenging for younger people to get this movie.  Furthermore, if you are a little hard of hearing, you will miss some of the quiet, British dialogue.

It stars Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay who, at 69 and 78, respectively, play the parts of Geoff and Kate Mercer, a supposedly happily married couple as they, or more properly, Kate, plans their 45th Wedding Anniversary celebration at the local banquet hall. Spanning a period of less than a week in their lives, this is the story of a long lost romance Geoff had well before he ever met Kate and how this 50 year old experience suddenly impacts on their present lives and, more significantly, Kate’s reaction and response to what she now learns about it. Mr. Courtenay plays a subdued and stoic role as he attempts to move on from the past while Ms. Rampling’s character becomes more absorbed with the historic details as if this now deceased part of her husband’s life is still alive and in competition with her. Enough cannot be said of the wonderful acting of Ms. Rampling who, with little or no dialogue, is able to express more emotion and feeling than most actors might if they were shouting. Although the film is long and at times somewhat tedious, it is in effect mirroring the relationship of the couple on the screen as they, in their typical British civility, struggle through the emotional obstacles that confront them. I give the film a 0 rating and credit Mr. Haigh with successfully accomplishing the dual role of good writing and directing."

Tom Courtenay is Geoff, while Charlotte Rampling is Kate, both giving superb performances. They play a couple who have been together for 45 years in the lead up to their huge anniversary party, but it’s on the Monday that Geoff receives that letter letting him know that the body of Katya, his previous love before Kate, has been found in the Swiss Alps. Oh so many years ago Geoff and Katya were on a walking holiday when Katya fell into a fissure in a glacier, with her body never actually found. It’s the letter that Geoff receives that brings him back to the memories of his first love, but it does the opposite to Kate. She actually never knew much about Katya because Geoff really never spoke about her much, but the letter seems to peak her interest in their relationship, and she learn things that Geoff had never confessed to her. Kate didn’t know that they were very serious about each other because it’s something that Geoff never talk about, all those years they’ve been together. Has he been hiding from Kate the true nature of him and Katia’s love for each other? Kate then calls into question her relationship with Geoff. Is she his true love? Or was it Katia? Kate increasingly becomes preoccupied, and worried about this. There’s also something within Geoff that has changed. He has begun smoking again, and he’s been going into the attic to look at the photos of him and Katia. Kate soon discovers that Katia was pregnant with Geoff’s child, and that Geoff having told Kate that he had planned to Marry Katia. As the huge anniversary party gets nearer, and as each day progresses, Katia becomes very unsure and unconfirment of Geoff’s love for her, but will this new revelation cancel/ruin the party?

Director Andrew Haigh, best known for his 2011 film Weekend which captured the short weekend relationship between two gay men, does a similar take in 45 Years, where he captures, in a week’s time, a long-term relationship between a straight married couple, in the lush surroundings and landscape of the Norfolk countryside. It’s a different perspective from his previous work, as well as from his hit television show ‘Looking’ – about gay men in San Francisco. In ’45 Years,’ he makes us slowly progress to the big day, that of the anniversary celebrations, with uncertainty, nervousness, and sadness, not just for Kate, but for Geoff as well. It’s like their entire relationship is being suddenly called into question. And Courtenay and Rampling give excellent performances. Courtenay’s Geoff seems to have no clue how this revelation is affecting Kate, while Rampling’s Kate slowly absorbs the truth about Katia, and is having a harder and harder time accepting it. Hers is an Academy Award worthy performance, and she’s been nominated (but somehow snubbed by the BAFTA’s – it’s a crime!). Based on a short story by British Poet David Constantine called Another Country, 45 Years slowly builds itself from a film that is a very simple quiet relationship of a long-married couple into a loud obstruction where it’s questionable whether there is any point to go nay further. 45 Years stars out as peaceful and quiet, yet gets messier and destructive. It’s one of the best and most beautiful films of the year."

This isn't always the easiest film to watch, but it leaves an indelible impression on anyone who sees it."
401,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/45-years/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Pontefractious,"Jan 19, 2016",9,"A teacher and a factory manager who has climbed his way up from the shop floor are retired and shortly to celebrate their 45th wedding anniversary. News comes that the body of a long ago girlfriend has emerged from a glacier in Switzerland. Little by little we learn that she died in an accident, that they were in love, that he has kept photos and mementos (in contrast to the 45 years of his marriage where they have nothing), and that she was expecting. The film is the story of the impact that this revelation has on the couple's relationship.
Most reviews have focused on the relationship's deterioration and the whys and wherefors. Curiously, though some came close, to my mind not one critic got it right. To understand the process fully you must appreciate that when these two married, distinctions of class were very much alive in the UK (some would say they still are). These two were never a good match. Perhaps the most ""in your face"" clue is his three failed efforts to get beyond chapter two of Kierkegaard. There are others such as Kate's expressed pleasure when he talks about bird watching. Here is not a man who enjoys intellectual pursuits. Again, his strong working class roots show in his complaint after the re-union lunch that the Len that they used to call Len-in now has a holiday home and a daughter dating/married to (I can't remember which) a banker. Jeff is clearly upset by this sell-out. But we don't really need these clues - Jeff clearly has what back then when they got married would have been considered a working class accent. And if you still need to be convinced, listen to Jeff talking during his speech at the party and referencing Kate's father's opposition to the marriage. Kate's father knew.
Kate, in contrast is educated (one critic noted that she was a head teacher). Her passage of arms with the caterer clearly indicates that she has taste and does not suffer fools gladly. But Kate has sublimated her middle class self. She must have realized at an early stage that the two of them have nothing in common. And here is the key. She has spent the last 45 years selflessly making the marriage work with precious little help from the self-centered Jeff. If pressed she would admit that it has involved sacrifice but it has paid off since they are still together. And then this happens. Kate gradually comes to the conclusion that that lifetime of sacrifice has been for nothing. The fragile marriage she has sought to preserve is meaningless. She has thrown her life away on someone who settled for her when his first love died. Self-centered Jeff doesn't even realize there has been a sacrifice and wouldn't understand it, still less appreciate it, even if he did. Yes, the revival of old and deep memories has had a strong effect on him. But he doesn't understand why Kate should be affected in any way. And there is the real story.  Kate feels that her whole life has been wasted. Not surprising that she is beyond being upset. Not surprising that that sentimental cloying speech of Jeff''s did nothing to reduce the pain. And what a perfect ending when Kate snatches her hand away. Perhaps the most eloquent gesture in film since Jonathan Pryce checked his watch at his mother's funeral in Ploughman's Lunch."

Her husband has never forgotten his Katcha, and the story of how she re-enters his life and how his reaction **** what seemed to be a solid relationship is beautifully told. I found this tragic story deeply moving and overwhelmingly sad thanks to Rampling’s wonderful portrayal of a woman whose belief in her husband’s love is shaken to the core and, judging by the last scene at their anniversary party, tragically broken forever.

Though it is slow and deliberate, the film never drags and really always grips you as you watch it all unfold. The film is interesting in the sense that thought it focuses on Rampling's character, it really provides an astute look at how both men and women look at relationships, in particular at how they progress as the years go on.

It takes place in just one week and the pace is unhurried. The story is subtle and nuanced, but everything counts in the unfolding of this extraordinarily difficult moment in this 45 year marriage. Charlotte Rampling is perfect in every detail in this unforced performance. It's like you're not watching acting at all."
408,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/45-years/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,knightofcups,"Dec 23, 2015",10,"45 Years can be experienced through Rampling's eyes from the first minute to the breathtaking final scene of last Andrew Haigh flick. The film begins with Courtenay's character receiving a letter confirming the death of his former lover, a situation which obviously triggers lots of problems indoors. What is seen from there is a relationship made of feathers that, at the earliest of opportunities, is finally blown. Rampling's eyes silently cry in despair during the 95 minutes of the film and during the best final twenty seconds of the cinema in 2015, you realize what really was going on during the forty five years. The direction of Haigh makes us forget that we are watching a film, the performances of Rampling and Courtenay transform the two strangers into old acquaintances being observed. This film will be stuck in my head for days."
409,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/45-years/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,foxgrove,"Dec 23, 2015",9,"A small low key drama that is big on impact as it rewards patient attention. The unfolding story takes place over the period of a week when Geoff (Tom Courtenay) and Kate (Charlotte Rampling) are about to hold a party to celebrate their 45 years together. The film slowly involves you in the couple’s relationship which is currently undergoing a testing time due to the arrival of a letter informing Geoff that a frozen body has been discovered in the Swiss Alps. This, believed to be that of his ex- girlfriend killed in a mountaineering accident just before he met Kate, unleashes all kinds of emotional turmoil, especially for Kate, and predictably ramifications ensue.
If the story is slight, although commendably very well written, the playing of the two leads is anything but. Tom Courtenay is good as Geoff but his role has to be considered a supporting one when compared to Charlotte Rampling. As Kate, she is at her superb best. In a hypnotically mesmerising turn, arguably her greatest, she displays all the inner turmoil through facial nuances and gestures. She is an absolute knockout here and this is yet another of her latter day performances that shows how maturity and age has really seen her come into her own. She is a fantastically underrated performer. Most actresses never enjoy the success that she has in her 50’s and 60’s. She is that rare example that defies the old adage that there are no good roles for women over 50. Well, her parts just keep getting better and better, as does she. Long gone are those indifferent roles in films like ‘Asylum’ and ‘Caravan to Vaccares’, enjoyable though they were. Director Andrew Haigh employs a similar technique to the one used in his excellent gay drama ‘Weekend’ and his location work in Norfolk is wonderfully refreshing. Most importantly though, having faith in his leading lady he unobtrusively lets Rampling carry the film. This she does with consummate ease."

It’s a damn shame all the de-aging hullabaloo distracted from his overall performance. Beyond the obvious comeuppance that characterized the 3rd act, it was also in a sense a poignant conclusion to Scorsese’s “gangster” filmography, and almost doubles as a meditation on his own life and career within the genre that has defined him."

Talking about the timeline, another downside is that the story is too flat, meaning that, in the duration of the movie, all the stories told are very simmilar with no action or drama to make them outstand.

Firstly, I really enjoyed it. It might even crack my Top 5 Scorsese films, however, as great as the story is - the movie is just way too long.

With being 3hrs long, you’d have to say something could be cut, but the strange thing is - I couldn’t tell you what to cut... It’s seamless. Each scene flows, for the most part, and sure some of it drags, but it all leads up to one hell of an ending. Each component is necessary for understanding the characters - so... if you have 3 hours to spend on watching a film. Go for it. Scorsese doesn’t disappoint."

There's so much to like about 'The Irishman'. From the top class performances, the ace cinematography, the excellent music and, most importantly, the captivating plot. I enjoyed this more than (the great) 'Goodfellas', which is my only previous experience of a Martin Scorsese film.

Robert De Niro is always a fantastic watch and here he is no different, I absolutely loved every scene of him as Frank. Al Pacino (Jimmy) and Joe Pesci (Russell) are also superb, Pacino particularly. Away from those three, you also have Ray Romano, Bobby Cannavale, Stephen Graham and Harvey Keitel involved. Awesome cast.

This is a tale about morality and loyalty.

Inside Out does work, and it's often quite clever in touching a broad range of delicate subjects in a way that can be appreciated by audiences young and old alike; no small balancing act. It's uproarious and cute and heady, but I couldn't shake the **** feeling that we were just barely scratching the surface here, even as the plot begins wrapping up.

There's plenty brewing under the table, but it still feels superficial, and the big developments in the third act don't totally feel like they've been earned when the credits roll. Granted, it's got a bushel of heavy messages to share, much more than many of its peers in the CG animation field, but when it's a delivery from the studio that brought us Toy Story, Monsters Inc. and Wall-E, there's a certain unspoken standard to meet. Inside Out represents a rebound for Pixar, certainly the best (and most creative) of their recent efforts, but it's not as sweeping, engulfing, or rewarding as the classic pedestals of their back catalog.

Updated thoughts after a 2024 re-watch: Pixar goes cerebral, visualizing hormones and emotions as walking, talking avatars in the mind of a pre-teen girl. Shaken by a cross-country move at a very sensitive age, we see her struggle from both perspectives: in the upstairs control room, where various color-coded operators are baffled by her mood swings, and in the outside world, where friends and family are similarly perplexed. Inside Out is a high-concept production, one which does occasionally beat us over the head with symbolism, but its writing is generally sharp and clever and it’s adept at distilling lofty ideas to a format that’s digestible for all ages. And Pixar certainly knows how to tug the heart strings, as they do repeatedly during the dueling inside/outside crises at the film’s climax.

Not as consistent as the studio’s better efforts, the plot is a balancing act between moments where the philosophical gambles pay off and those where it gets a little too cute. The vital push-and-pull between Joy and Sadness is at the heart of things, an uneasy friendship/rivalry that tips and sways before reaching a state of zen, and that’s handled very well. The two abstract creatures’ escape through the long-term memory banks and bumpy rides on the train of thought... eh, those felt like more of a reach. A convenient use of familiar terms to suit the narrative.

When they work, Inside Out’s big concepts are deep and powerful; an elegant way to dissect complicated thoughts and feelings by way of shiny blue, gold and purple cupie dolls. When they don’t, the illusion swiftly falls apart. Before the story concludes, we get plenty of the former, but also a not-insignificant helping of the latter. A nice rebound from the missteps of Cars 2 and Monsters University, but not quite as sweeping, engulfing, or rewarding as the pillars of the studio’s classic catalog."

This is a film, that is close to being a MASTERPIECE, while it's not one of the greats, it's a damn good film that in the end made me Cry. A few films do that, It has great characters, Pacing, Story, and a lot of fun, jokes, and emotional resonance stuffed in, that many would enjoy, and relate to. The only thing wrong with this film, is just the Run Time, and the other Emotions not getting more screen time, but otherwise, it's a Solid Film.9/10, That's a DAMN GOOD FILM."

Age stages is a favorite subject of Pixar, middle age in The Incredibles and old age in Up; Inside Out is also a story of growing up, examining childhood and adolescence.

""Have you ever looked at someone and wondered what they were thinking?"" The story begins with a question.

Dream studio, prison of the unconscious, islets of character, spikes, imaginary friend; The connections between them are very successful.

Emotion centers and their effects on decision making were also realistic but incomplete; but maybe it can be detailed in a further / different version, because other factors affecting the character are not taken into account. But that's not the focus of the movie anyway, so it doesn't affect its success much.

499,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/inside-out-2015/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,kyle20ellis,"Mar 29, 2022",10,"Most of Pixar's films are wonderful (short films too), and while the three films made after Toy Story 3 weren't up to their top standards they were still better than most animation companies at their worst. Inside Out was nothing short of a masterwork, Pixar's best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall.

Pixar films can be relied upon to have great animation, and Inside Out certainly does have great animation. No, wonderful animation and some of the company's most ingeniously inventive, with gorgeously vibrant colours, a very imaginatively rendered setting (and the lands even more ingeniously done, the next land more so than the last), very meticulous and beautifully modelled backgrounds and clever character designs that match the emotions more than ideally. Michael Giacchino's sparkling, rousing and very charming score is one of my personal favourite scores of the year so far, and every bit as great as his score for Up.

A superb job was done with the script here too, the comedy is clever and witty without ever being forced and balances subtly with the drama, the drama is some of the most truly poignant of any Pixar film and it doesn't ever feel manipulative or overdone and it's very smartly insightful. The story, not one of THE most innovative concepts but is one of the more imaginative uses of it and is quite original for Pixar actually, goes at a slightly steadier pace than other Disney films, but still captivated. It was very easy to completely connect with Riley and her situation and this was easily the Pixar film since Toy Story 3 that I connected with emotionally the most, also one of Pixar's most moving stories quite easily.

Loved the characters too, Anger, Fear, Disgust and Bing Bong (the imaginary friend and the 'epitome of immaturity', without ever being annoying, his back story did bring a tear to the eye) stole every scene they were in, and even Sadness managed to crack some funny one-liners even in her depressive state. Joy also positively lights up the screen and Riley was easy to connect with and much more than just a stereotypical teen girl. The voice acting is splendid. Amy Poehler is note perfect as Joy with her spirited banter giving the character so much life while also bringing a human element to her as well, Lewis Black gives an explosively barn-storming turn as Anger, Phyllis Smith is amusing and affecting, Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling are similarly priceless and in a way that makes the characters of Fear and Disgust endearing rather than annoying, Richard Kind is innocently charming and Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane are appropriately compassionate.

Overall, a masterful return to form for Pixar. It's their best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall as well. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Pixar brings the storyline perfectly by sliding disney magic while having emotions while watching this movie. A MUST-SEE.
505,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/inside-out-2015/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,pur__0_0__,"Aug 20, 2021",9,"Pixar has made movies of all kinds - What if toys, insects, monsters, cars, fishes or rats had feelings. And now they have made Inside Out - what if feelings had feelings? Inside Out is probably one of the most underrated movies that Pixar has made. It was the first original Pixar movie which I didn't get to know about when it released (the first such one was a sequel, Monsters University), and I'm really surprised how this movie gets overlooked so easily.
The way I see it, this movie is a social commentary about how we perceive life with our emotions. Riley here is a metaphor of us, how we feel when we move to a new place and are unable to handle the new life. In such situations we either feel scared, angry or depressed. When Riley starts crying in class, Joy tries to stop Sadness from ruining her memory with a vacuum but ends up destroying all her other memories. This is another metaphor from our lives, where we end up forgetting all our happy memories in times of desperation.
Later on Joy and Sadness are in her memories, where they see Riley's childhood drawing of Bing Bong whom she considered her friend. The plot has been made with a complete sense of nostalgia. When we feel nostalgic, we feel both happiness and sadness at the same time. We are happy because we got to live those times, the time which was better than what we are living at the moment. We are sad because we know that time never stops, and so everyday we are straying further away from when it happened. We will never be able to live the day again, and it shall only stay in our memory.
While Joy and Sadness are not present Fear, Anger and Disgust control her. I don't think I need to explain this. Riley has lost all her happiness and does not feel any sadness. Keep in mind she had previously cried in class, which is something very embarrassing for a ten year old child. As a result she does not want to show her sorrow in front of everyone since she fears people will laugh at her, so instead she tries to cover it with anger and disgust. This is just like how we behave when we are depressed but are also too afraid of what others might think if they learn about it.
And then there is the memory dump, the place where the old memories are forgotten. This is one of the deepest messages that the movie gave us. To save Joy and Sadness and allow them to get out of the pit, Bing Bong readily sacrifices himself. This is because he had always considered himself and Riley friends, and he was ready to sacrifice his own life for this. It also shows how Riley has now lost the memory of Bing Bong due to her depression and frustration, and it is something she will never remember again. This is a metaphor of how we forget the small details from our childhood which gave us joy once we grow out of the phase. It also symbolises that although Bing Bong has been lost forever, Riley's joy and sadness will always remember him. This is similar to how we get nostalgic whenever we see our childhood writings and drawings.
And finally when Joy and Sadness do make it back, then Joy chooses to let Sadness guide Riley. If she wanted she could have guided Riley and make her feel happy about reuniting with her parents. But in that case the moment would have completely lost the impact. So instead Sadness did it, which is why Riley started crying, something she had not done for a long time. This is yet another metaphor of when we are unable to hold our sorrow for too long and burst out crying. As a result her parents are finally able to understand the situation she is in and give her more love.
In the end Riley starts feeling happy, since everyone has understood the value of Joy. She was the first emotion that Riley felt, and the one who guided them all in the time of desperation. All the other emotions came to her afterwards, which is why they are not as emotionally attached to Riley as Joy does. Joy knows what is the best for her, just like how we feel the best thing for our life is what makes us feel happy.
The only problem I had with this movie was, well, it looks way too subtle. The reason why this movie is so overlooked is because of how ordinary it looks compared to all the heavyweights that Pixar makes. Riley's face also a little too wrong. It looks like an adult's nose has been put on a child's face. Anger looks like he is made of synthetic sponge. Plus it doesn't make sense that in spite of seeing over and over that he is making mistakes, he still does not let Disgust and Fear do the work which does not give enough balance to all of the characters.
But other than that Inside Out is a very good movie for a character study. I have never before seen a family movie with such a deep, hidden philosophy. The only one which comes even close to it is Zootopia, but it was more inclined towards telling the story than giving the message. Inside Out is a definite must-watch in my opinion if you like movies like these. I really hope this one gets a sequel."

529,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/call-me-by-your-name/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Yulianap,"Apr 7, 2022",10,"Call me by your name es una película de romance y drama italiana estrenada en el 2017. Con una duración de 1.30 minutos. Dirigida por Luca Guadagnino, Guionizada por James Ivory, protagonizada por Timothée Chalamet, Armie Hammer entre otros. En 2017 ganadora de un Oscar a mejor guion adaptado. Incluyendo 4 nominaciones, película y actor (Timothée Chalamet). En el mismo año nominada en el festival de Toronto y fue la segunda finalista a mejor película. Es una historia ocurrida en un verano de 1983, el padre de Elio un profesor de arqueología italiano invita a un joven norteamericano llamado Oliver, quien será su asistente de arqueología en un proyecto muy importante. Al principio a Elio no le cae bien Oliver, pero con el tiempo empiezan a despertarse diferentes sentimientos y tensiones entre ellos. Está película trasmite muchas emociones, es muy bonito como a pesar del año en donde se basan los hechos. Las personas entendían y aceptaban la homosexualidad. De algún modo los personajes tenían más libertad para expresar su amor. Es interesante como el director plantea el ejemplo de Elio y Oliver, de cómo comienza a despertar su amor a través del otro, y con el paso de los días es mas fuerte lo que sienten. El desarrollo es lo que más conecta al público que ve la película. Porque se ve como ellos aprovechan cada espacio que tiene solos, para poder amarse de la manera en que lo hacen. Esas emociones tan intensas que muestran atrapan mucho al público.  Como toda película dramática tiene un final muy doloroso para los personajes principales. Esta es una película que sinceramente toca las fibras más profundas de los espectadores. Para terminar, en una película muy recomendada para aquellas personas amantes del romance y drama, en está filme podrán encontrar diferentes escenas de pasión y amor una increíble combinación; sin duda alguna, es una cinta cinematográfica en donde hay mucha valentía e inspiración.
Merece una calificación de 10 estrellas, en una escala de 0 a 10."

Yes it can sometimes play as a ode to Italy with how often it lingers on landscape an architectural shots but it never does so without contributing well to the stories tone.

an ephemeral love story way too many lgbtqia+ youths can relate to ,falling for an older man, deifying that romance only to be abandoned once the significant other leaves for more ''realistic ''prospects post statutory exploitation. those who critique this film for glorifying pedophilia are unaware of movies being a vehicle for real story's and that not every story has o be attached to an agenda in fact i argue if any agenda is attached it's cautionary and very aware of the lovers age difference. firstly timothy's portrayal is purposefully youthful, he is a boyish man naturally and in the presence of Armie Hammer seems demur .i see his story as a honest telling of a love story one that is one sided .i do not think elio's love is shared by Oliver who's mostly flattered and ****. Its a dark romance and once it's viewed as one he movie is even more impressive as i begin o see the bright Italian setting reminiscent of old co-existing with the new.

The setting is lovely - it's only described as 'somewhere in Northern Italy' and there's some relatively thoughtful dialogue present, although there are some scenes when the characters don't talk too often. I also enjoyed the classical/instrumental music often played in the background, which gives it a somewhat dream-like/floaty feel or sense. I particularly liked the light piano tunes, which had a bit of an ethereal sense to them at times. The characters seem very thoughtful and it's quite an atmospheric film. I would recommend it, yes."

The story takes place in Italy in the 80's, and this movie lives up and respects that time period with style and respect. Old Alfa Romero's and Fiats fill the streets, bars packed with town people drinking and playing cards on the corner chain-smoking packs of cigarettes. The director had a clear, vivid vision for this film and it shows masterfully on-screen. I haven't seen chemistry like this in so long. Timonthée and Armie were great together. Also, I want to also praise Michael Stuhlbarg, his monologue delivery at the end was so on point that watching the film in theater for the first time brought tears to my eyes.

Timothee Chalamet gives one of the best performances I've ever seen and he works wonderfully beside Armie Hammer. I was never a big fan of Armie, but after seeing him in this I have much more respect for him. I'd never heard of Luca Guadagnino prior to watching this, but now I'd consider him one of the best filmmakers just because of this one masterwork. A lot of people won't understand why I love this so much, it's slow, it's long and there's not a lot of dialogue, but that's exactly why it's so damn good. It's slow because it's taking it's time developing the romance the fires up between the two characters, it's long because you need time to take it all in, and there's not a lot of dialogue because who needs words when you have incredible performances, and an extremely talented director. The cinematography in this film is some of the best I've ever seen, the location in which this film takes place is glorious and I'm honored to say I've been there. Call Me By Your Name is my favorite movie and Timothee Chalamet is now one of my favorite actors. This movie isn't for everybody, but it certainly is for me."

Lifelong tragic comedy, especially the sober dealing with the consequences of a divorce dispute and the whole beginnings of it, including the machinery behind it, especially the common practice in the USA, illustrates the drama behind it all.

Driver and Johansson give two of the best performances of their careers and Noah Baumbach is at his Baumbachiest with dialog, actions, composition, and drama depicted as if it is actually real life. The immersion into the story that direction and those performances create is undeniable. These characters feel like real people. The story never takes a side and drives you to an understanding about the polarity and dissension of the process of divorce."

Well, then we have a sad and philosophical movie filled with sad, sometimes funny, (and sometimes both at the same time), moments that make you question your own relationships, and the ones around them.

The movie itself is a very entertaining drama, but it's more than only that, it carries many hidden messages underneath various layers of incredible acting and amazing soundtrack, it carries messages about family, love, and hate, and it does this in a very meaningful and sensitive way.

Both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deserved Oscars for their very convincing and touching acting, that, together with the amazing script written by Noah Baumbach, creates one of the best Netflix productions I've ever seen."

I wasn’t sure if I wanted to put myself through the no-doubt emotional ringer of Baumbach’s story of the dissolution of a marriage. It was a hard film, but a damned fine one. It had an honest script that only a few times felt like it wasn’t truly drawn from life – mostly when we get speeches. I think I’m the only one who didn’t care for Laura Dern’s Mary/motherhood speech. Took me out of the naturalness in everything else. Adam Driver and ScarJo where wholly believable. And screw Ray Liotta’s character. That guy ruined everything, as I honestly cared for both of our leads. While I feel the movie is more in Charlie’s side, the film is mostly balanced as not not be good-guy/bad-guy and important as through everything Charlie and Nicole love each other and that’s important. I don’t think it’ll crack my top ten when I update but comes darn close."
607,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/marriage-story/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,AJGo85,"Feb 9, 2020",7,"Despite its annoyingly vague title, Marriage Story is actually about a divorce. On one level writer-director Noah Baumbach’s latest film feels like a divorce procedural. We follow a young attractive couple (Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver) as they agree to keep things simple and not involve lawyers, then involve lawyers, begin a custody battle, and try to navigate all of the emotional and legal complexities of legally dissolving a marriage. On another level, Marriage Story is a showcase of brilliant performances ranging from subtle to ostentatious, comical to moving. I enjoyed Marriage Story far more than I expected though I hesitate to recommend it since very few people (myself included) are able to have a good time by watching people argue and get divorced for over two hours. The divorce gets rocky but the film doesn’t so much and if you are in the right mood for a relationship/divorce drama you’ll find a decent, somehow, feel good movie.

This is the kind of movie that hangs entirely on its performances. Fortunately, the leads and supporting players all turn in strong performances. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver have both earned Oscar nominations for their performances as the wife and husband seeking to uncouple themselves while remaining involved with their eight-year-old son and maintaining their careers. Both earn and lose and then earn back your sympathy. Charlie (Driver) is a successful New York theater director whose latest avant-garde production is headed to Broadway. Nicole (Johansson) once starred in a popular Hollywood movie but since meeting and marrying Charlie has committed herself to the stage. A Los Angeles native, Nicole has always wanted to spend more time on the West Coast and now has landed a role in a pilot that will likely become a series. Charlie thinks of them as a New York family and expects Nicole and their son to move back to New York once the pilot is done. When Nicole decides to officially file for divorce the real conflict between them begins.

Baumbach’s script does not overtly take sides though it leans toward Charlie, especially toward the end of the film. The explosive climatic argument between Nicole and Charlie gives a chance for both actors to express intense emotions, but it is Driver who gets to let out overwhelming pathos. A court appointed observer—played with welcome awkward comic deadpan by Martha Kelly—is assigned to visit and interview both parents, but we only see the visit Charlie. Charlie does his best to present as an ideal father before the visit falls into dark comedy. In a wonderfully delivered monologue early in the film, Nicole gives us her backstory, both life events and emotional. After this scene the perspective shifts to Charlie and never really shifts back to Nicole. We are as blindsided as Charlie is by claims on money and custody by Nicole’s lawyer.

Nora, Nicole’s flashy and smoothly confident high-powered lawyer, is played with impressive ease by Laura Dern, who has earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination. We’re just as charmed and dazzled by her as Nicole, and just as stung by her as Charlie. Alan Alda delivers some great low-key comedy as Charlie’s first divorce lawyer. He’s old enough that his hands shake but also old enough to know how bad a divorce can get, and how it will likely end, so, he recommends just starting there. On the complete opposite end of the spectrum is Ray Liotta as Charlie second divorce lawyer, a high powered and extremely expensive pit-bull. He speaks with such speed and ridiculous intensity that he can’t help but be funny and believable as a ruthless lawyer. Julie Hagerty is a welcome presence as Nicole’s actress mother. She has so much flighty warmth that she secretly helps Charlie find a divorce lawyer.

I’m sure certain viewers that have been through a divorce or even a bad breakup will find something relatable with the characters and situation in Marriage Story. I wouldn’t be surprised if other viewers find these characters and their situation unrelatable. Nicole and Charlie, though not wealthy, are in a very upper middle class bracket. They are so accomplished that momentous life changing events like landing a starring role in a TV show and earning an Emmy nomination for directing (Nicole) and winning a MacArthur “genius” grant (Charlie) are just background plot points. Whether you can relate or not, the performances from Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are of such a rare quality as to keep you invested in their emotional journey."

This is a really solid Netflix Original drama. It’s really well-acted, the writing is excellent and the story is engaging. It deals with some pretty tough subject matter, it’s about a couple going through a divorce, but it also has light moments of comedy. It feels very realistic. It’s also really well-shot and well-edited. This is one of those rare movies where there really isn’t anything bad about it at all. Well, maybe the score is a little weird and distracting sometimes. It’s composed by Randy Newman and sounds right out of a Pixar movie. Wallace Shawn of The Incredibles and Toy Story fame is even in it. It seems out-of-place sometimes, but the rest of the movie is so good I think I can overlook it. Overall, this movie is a must-see and I hope it wins some Oscars!"

It's also a supremely well-executed artistic experience on a structural, dramatic, thematic, and technical level. It's rare to have a film operate so meticulously in its characterization process, yet remain so fascinating and emotionally impressive. In many other films, you'd label it a potential issue to have your average scene length be somewhere between 7-10 minutes, and to have most of those scenes involve characters simply talking to one another. But these are very carefully constructed moments of build-up, allowing the audience to breathe these characters in and empathize with every action taken and word spoken, no matter how hurtful or diabolical it may seem on the surface. At the end of the proverbial day, we find we're dealing with nuanced human beings trying desperately to navigate their respective ways through a tragic phase of existence (a kind of death, as the movie so aptly puts it). It's sad, heartwarming, brilliant, and earnest -- an experience I know I'll carry with me for some time."

The directing, cinematography and overall presentation are fine but it's a very entertaining and well written story, with complex and realistic characters with both pros and flaws that will make almost impossible to see who is the ""hero"" and who is the ""villain"". This is not a movie about two people yelling at each other it's much more than that. To make it short: Brilliant writing, brilliant characters, entertaining story and masterful performances. The only thing I didn't like as much is the score. I mean, the score is not bad but sometimes I think it didn't fit the movie. Without context, the score itself is amazing but when it's played during the movie I couldn't stop thinking about Toy Story.

Overall, I highly recommend it."
618,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-la-land/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,davidlovesfilm,"Oct 20, 2024",10,"""La La Land"" is a visually stunning, emotionally evocative musical that blends classic Hollywood romance with modern-day sensibilities. Written and directed by Damien Chazelle, the story follows Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a passionate jazz musician, as they navigate their dreams, careers, and relationships in Los Angeles. As they pursue their artistic ambitions, their relationship faces both exciting and painful challenges. The movie utilizes a backdrop of vivid color palettes, romantic locations, and jazz music, and captures the dreamlike but realistic highs and lows of juggling both love and success.

The genre of La La Land is a modern musical, drawing from the traditions of Hollywood's Golden Age, such as the dramatic romance and breakup seen at the end of Casablanca, while incorporating the sensibilities of contemporary cinema. While it is an original work, it shares thematic and stylistic connections with his last film like ""Whiplash,"" another film by Chazelle which explores the sacrifices required for artistic greatness. La La Land is not part of a series or an adaptation, but it reflects some nostalgia for musicals while telling a fresh story.

Emma Stone's portrayal of Mia is filled with sincerity and relatability. Her arc—from struggling barista to aspiring actress—strikes an emotional chord, and her performance of ""Audition (The Fools Who Dream)"" is a highlight. Gosling's Sebastian is both parts dreamy and stubborn, focusing on the sacrifices he makes for his music and love. Chazelle's direction is successfully able to bring these elements together, combining musical spectacles with emotional resonance. His understanding of both the extravagant musical genre and the human experience allows La La Land to feel timeless. While the film might feel like a reflection of classic musicals, it raises expectations, especially in its ending that is more bittersweet than a typical Hollywood romance. It’s undeniable that the film takes on the complexity of ambition, love, and personal sacrifice in a meaningful way. It’s about the tension and hardships that come between following your dreams and the realities of life, a theme that resonates with many people in today’s world.

In terms of filmmaking, ""La La Land"" swing for the fences and scores high well in almost every aspect. The cinematography by Linus Sandgren is visually stunning, with sweeping shots which reflect both the characters' emotional arcs and elevate the setting of Los Angeles. The opening scene, a large-scale musical number set on a freeway during rush hour, immediately sets the tone for the film’s playful and extravagant approach to storytelling. The color palette is constructed to evoke each scene’s mood, from the vibrant oranges and pinks of sunsets to the more muted blues and grays used in more somber moments. The editing by Tom Cross allows the film to flow seamlessly from one number to the next, without disrupting the story's emotional rhythm. In particular, the long, uninterrupted takes during dance sequences help show a sense of realism within the world of the movie. The sound design and music by Justin Hurwitz with songs by the duo of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul and are crucial to the story’s emotional depth, with the score and songs such as “City of Stars” and “Another Day of Sun” becoming memorable, almost iconic, pieces of the film.

Ultimately, ""La La Land"" is a cinematic experience that combines beautiful visuals, exceptional music, and deeply emotional performances. Whether you’re a fan of musicals or not, its exploration of relationships and dreams makes it universally enjoyable. The film’s balance of romance, drama, and music is captivating and thought-provoking. In conclusion, I believe La La Land is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates a beautiful film with heart, stunning visuals, and a fantastic score. Its emotional complexity and depth allow it to be considered more than just a simple romance, making it a memorable cinematic experience. I would highly recommend La La Land for anyone looking for a film that is both fun and also leaves them with something to reflect on. The performances, music, and direction make this film something that years from now will stand the test of time still be a highly regarded piece of cinema."

Il film è capolavoro. Acclamato dalla critica, se ne parlerà anche fra 50 anni. Apprezzato anche dal pubblico.
La recitazione è ad ottimi livelli, la scenografia beh è spettacolare, la musica per me è 10 puro.

E' un must see.
Ryan gosling ottimo, emma stone ottima.
La performance di John Legend ottima.
Senza fare spoiler, del finale se ne parlerà per decenni.
Un film che è tutto un inseguimento di sogni, poi la riuscita o meno bisogna coglierla guardando il film.

Non vedo nessun tipo di difetto. 
Da vedere."

Emma Stone shined like a diamond in this film, combining the best of her acting, gorgeous looks, and charming character. I could not have picked a better couple for this film than Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Their performance together took my heart to far-away galaxies a hundred times over, and still left me hungry for more! The sheer power of a Steinway and Sons Piano and the soothing, nostalgic sounds it makes, takes this film's power of emotion to a whole other level. The filming was excellent combined with the dancing, music, and setting of each scene. All of it combined made for a mind-blowing romance which deserves all the praise it has received from the hungry critics. Two thumbs way up."

God this movie makes every virgin truly feel like one. The movie wants to teach you how to love love and yet you start to resent it. The film is truly a technical perfection. Camera, light, colour, sound and effects. The soundtrack (original) is the best of any movie I’ve ever watched. From the theme song to the obscure background tracks. The music is a turn on fr fr. The characters themselves are anything but bland. The audience is invested in their story. Mia and Seb are only that great because of the on-screen chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Love, hate, laughter, sadness carry the movie through the challenging streets of Los Angeles. I love that the movie gave an alternate ending for the basic **** watching it and it being heartwarming for them. But, the true ending which is so synonymous to real life is also shown for us filmbros and cinephiles. Damien Chazelle is a master of his craft. So if you’re in the mood for love tonight, watch it."
668,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lady-bird/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,drqshadow,"Sep 20, 2024",7,"An eccentric, erratic young woman seeks direction in the twilight of her high school years. Alternately addressing her need to rebel, to cast away everything she once held sacred, and to remain true to herself, she frequently acts on impulse, then later deals with the regrets and repercussions. As did many of us, during the moody, impressionable years of adolescence. She's not quite sinking, but not quite swimming, seeking a way out while also realizing how much the familiarity and security of her long-term hometown means to her.

It's a time of transition, of can't-go-back decisions, and the weight of those choices looms over both the title character and her loved ones. For the first time, the heaviness of the real world is infringing upon her, from her family's financial struggles to the slim chances of admittance to her dream schools, and it's no easy road for anyone: herself, her selflessly supportive father or her imposing (and constantly fretting) mother. It covers a lot of emotional churn and introspection in a relatively low-key way, almost exclusively through casual dialogue and dinner-table debates.

The conclusion is a bit off-putting - it doesn't end, just stops - but in some ways, that's a better tonal match than the more theatrical scene that could've been chosen a few minutes earlier. Rich and human and familiar, if not transcendent."

This coming-of-age drama sees the journey of its titular character through the final year of high school. Lady Bird's relationship with her mother is tumultuous and taut as she yearns for a better life and standing.
Lady Bird is a coming-of-age story wholly; it embodies an annoying realism on young adult themes.
Starring Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf (who steals all her scenes), Lucas Hedges, Timothée Chalamet, and Beanie Feldstein, Lady Bird boasts good performances. It's also a good directorial debut for Greta Gerwig.
Everything about Lady Bird is solid and well-made, but it doesn't transform the movie to a grand status like critic reviews suggest. Lady Bird is not a movie that's sure to elicit recommendations, but it's one you won't regret seeing.

673,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lady-bird/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,kyle20ellis,"Mar 18, 2022",10,"With one of my favourite trailers of the year, the awards attention, the theme of coming of age and the critical acclaim, 'Lady Bird' very quickly became one of the year's most anticipated films for me. Deliberately didn't see it at opening weekend though, just in case it was busy and difficult to get tickets, after the insane opening weekend of 'Black Panther'.

'Lady Bird' in no way disappointed. With the above, was hoping that it would be one of my favourite films of the year and it turned out to be exactly that, the awards attention and acclaim more than fully deserved. This doesn't just fly, 'Lady Bird' actually soars and have not seen a coming of age-themed film in recent memory this sparkling or honest or with this amount of humour, brains, heart and charm. Have seen it mentioned as a passion project, and if it was the passion and hard work can be seen all over.

It is a very appealing film visually, with beautiful and colourful cinematography and with editing that flows succinctly and cohesively. The music is has energy yet knows when to understate itself when needed. In her first film as solo director, Greta Gerwig directs with a nimble touch, the comedy is light on its feet and she avoids making the emotional elements heavy-handed or tonally jarring.

The script is one of the year's best, my personal pick actually for this year's Best Original Screenplay Oscar of the nominees. The comedy sparkles in wit and is genuinely hilarious, done in an honest and true to life way yet with some cringes like it would be in real life too. Over-sentimentality is avoided in the more emotional and dramatic scenes, there are some really sweet and poignant moments and an endearing personal touch.

Found myself really emotionally investing in and relating to the mother and daughter relationship, their bonding bringing tears to my eyes and then making me smile and laugh when botched and leaving me with hope at resolution at the same time. The coming of age/angsty elements have a truthfulness, authenticity and twinkle and it was very easy to identify with them if in the same position growing up, they're often very funny but also very heartfelt and charming.

Story is immensely engaging throughout right from the riotous opening to the more emotional and avoiding-being-too-pat ending, anchored by the mother and daughter relationship that entertains, moves and provokes thought. Didn't mind at all that it wasn't ground-breaking, due to not expecting it to be as coming of age can be predictable. Enjoyed the way the characters were written, and appreciated that the film broke away from the typical archetype of school teachers being over-disciplinary and without humour.

Performances are never less than great, with Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf fully inhabiting their characters and phenomenally. It was wonderful for both to get awards attention with both giving two of the year's best performances. Lois Smith twinkles too in her role.

If Lucas Hedges (who has grown quite a lot) and Timothee Chalamet (not as good as his truly remarkable performance in 'Call Me By Your Name' but showing why he is one of the most promising recent rising stars) continue to go down this promising path they are likely to go on to big careers.

Concluding, fabulous film and one of my favourites of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

If I have to be honest, the movie was not particularly interesting. Personally, I appreciate, that it is related to real life, maybe not only related, but also it represents the picture of most people's lives - not knowing who you are, strange relationships and everyday struggle with family members and friends, problems in school and in finding university and intimate life. So, I appreciate the focus on that. It's teen drama though. It says the movie is drama and comedy, didn't rally feel the comedy there. ""Yes, I gave that name to myself. It is given to me by me"" - that was fun haha! Anyway, I am used to teen comedies and I didn't get that movie as comedy. Somehow, soundtracks weren't enough and the script wasn't something special.

I liked the quirky aspect to it and how laidback the main character is. She certainly tests the boundaries in relation to her mother. Also, its more of a drama than a comedy film overall, although there are some amusing moments.

Also true is there aren't exactly no cliches present but its a well presented film and it isn't too cheesy overall, I'd say, so I'd recommend it all the same (plus, in my eyes, Saoirse Ronan can (all but) do no wrong).

I've also liked Greta Gerwig as an actress in films I've seen thus far, so it was interesting seeing this, given its Greta's directorial debut. I reckon she is someone to look out for, as a director, in the future."

She is not a person that does the right things, her conflicts are often self made, but at the end she learns the faults of her character and begins to reconcile with her mother and no longer hide behind what she now views as a facade, her ""new name"" Ladybird.

Lady Bird tries a bit too hard to come off as artsy and rebellious, which comes off as extremely stereotypical and played out. Even so, the film has an ounce of relatability that’s I find admirable. The theme of trying to find your identity hits me hard as someone struggling to find my own identity, regardless of how the film felt cliché. I find myself relating to Lady Bird in that sense, and that’s one thing that makes the film the slightest bit impressive. I also find the camera work in the last few scenes, specifically the ending when Lady Bird was driving in her car, impressive, and the ending of the movie was wholesome and impactful."

Within the 2 hours the coming of age film went on, Christine went through many small mentality changing events that the average teenager would never even think about. She experienced what she described as “the other side of the track” from her life in semi poverty."
689,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lady-bird/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,KamrinW,"Apr 14, 2021",8,"The film 2017 “Lady Bird” by Greta Gerwig is a coming-of-age showpiece. The film’s relationships throughout the story, acting, and screenplay are wonderful. Sure the film is cliche at times but this adds to the authenticity of it. How many movies start with a rebellious child? Many but also how many people in the real world have been rebellious children?, also Many. Also one complaint is that Lady Bird never explained how or why she chose her name. Besides that the film is great.
	The story of the play is amazing. It brings you along with a girl named Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson who is a senior who is trying to get into a east coast college but encounters issues along the way. Lady Bird has to deal with many issues but the main one is her relationships. She has to confront her relationships with her best friend, mother, her lovers, and even her identity. Lady bird slowly matures and learns that her best friend and mother are always there for her even when things are rough. She also learns that people lie, even lovers. She lastly learns to love her home and everything that she knew all too well. The story takes an amazing approach on the relationships people build in break as they transition into adulthood. It teaches young people to try to create better relationships that will benefit you rather than hurt you.
	The acting in the film is spectacular. The actors play their role almost as if they were being themselves. The emotions portrayed between Ladybird and her mother are so intense. Their arguing seems almost too real at some points and it gives me chills at times. I believe ladybird played her role so well because she saw some parts of herself in ladybird. Throughout the film, the emotion portrayed in regards to the relationships is flawless and as natural as any film could be. The screenplay is wonderful because I feel as if it is created based on actual happenings. The film is so natural and the emotion brought out from different occurrences is amplified with the realism of it all. All of the film is scripted but it seems so real. The film seems that you are looking into the life of an actual person. It gives a sense of familiarity when watching the movie because it allows you to relate and discuss what is happening. In conclusion, “Lady Bird” is an amazing coming-of-age story that visually shows the life of a teenage girl who has to grow up and deal with her current life situation. Overall the story is pretty good despite the cliche and occasional lack of explanation for things. The film is an amazing reminder that everyone is human and should learn from each other. It also teaches to love yourself and try to live with joy and happiness. I recommend this film to anyone who is struggling with becoming an adult or even struggling with relationships in general."

691,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lady-bird/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,natythebaddie,"Apr 13, 2021",7,"The music definitely played a huge role in the film. The song that caught my attention the most was ¨Hand In My Pocket¨ by Alanis Morissette. The song is played in the car when Lady Bird is with her father. The song says the following, ¨I'm broke, but I'm happy, I'm poor, but I'm kind, I'm short, but I'm healthy, yeah, I'm high, but I'm grounded, I'm sane, but I'm overwhelmed, I'm lost, but I'm hopeful, baby¨ which I feel is the most accurate way to describe Lady Birds feelings and how she feels stuck in her environment, like she's okay but she's not. She knows she can do better for herself, she realizes her potential but she feels held back by her social class and the opportunities she thinks she doesn´t have. As far as the acting in the film, it was excellent. The contrast between Lady Bird and her mother was great. The love/hate relationship they carried in the film was very relatable and at the same time, it didn't feel forced. They both played their part extremely well that they complemented each other. Props to Mama Lady Bird though, she maintains her ¨tough mom¨ look throughout the entire film. She never let Lady Bird see her vulnerable side. Even when Lady Bird leaves for college, she keeps a front. At that point, she wanted to bid farewell to Lady Bird but it was too late. In the film, she never showed her vulnerable side.


All in all, Lady Bird is a great film, the first time you watch it. After that, you could easily get bored of it. It is a very cliche story but it has so much potential. Nothing really happens and a few issues brought up are never finished. Something I really liked, though, was the little insight of Lady Bird's life in college and that mini epiphany she got when she called her parents.

Greta Gerwig's is successful towards conveying a semi-autobiographical take on a teen struggling with her identity that radiates nostalgia and relatability."
711,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lady-bird/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,IsaacJ,"Jan 2, 2019",10,"Greta Gerwig’s solo directorial debut is an ode of sorts both to her own upbringing in Sacramento and to the **** experiences of all teenagers just trying to fit in. It may have received no love at the Oscars (albeit with several nominations), but Lady Bird is a masterpiece of a film, deliciously amusing and, above all, heartfelt.
Lady Bird may be semi-autobiographical (it gives a sense of being deeply personal to its creator throughout), but it is not a young Greta Gerwig whose story we follow, rather Christine MacPherson (Saoirse Ronan), a Sacramento teen who prefers to be referred to by her “given name”, Lady Bird (“I gave it to myself, it’s given to me by me”). We watch as Lady Bird makes that daunting transition from adolescence to adulthood, battling the struggles of friendships, love and a more than uneasy relationship with her mother Marion (a phenomenal Laurie Metcalf). What is perhaps most incredible about Lady Bird is the way it takes one of the most cliched, safe genres in cinema, the coming-of-age, and manages to bring a freshness and spark to it with such ease. Lady Bird breaks no ground with its plot, but it proves that a film doesn’t have to do so to instil a real feeling in its audience and be something special. Greta Gerwig’s direction is utterly flawless; her understanding of character and canny eye for period detail lend the film a profound sincerity and a slick appearance, thoughtful and detailed down to a tee. Lady Bird feels like a love letter from Gerwig, a classic example of a film that is evidently special to its director and translates its emotional impact perfectly to its audience. This movie made me laugh and cry, often from one to the other, like a game of ping pong, yet never feeling unnatural or forced.
In truth, the success of Lady Bird relies on one person; Saoirse Ronan is faultless as the eponymous lead, bringing a youthful spunkiness to the role, coupled with a gorgeous vulnerability. Gerwig is not afraid to depict ultimately flawed characters; no truer is this seen than in Ronan’s performance, the young star carrying the film on her shoulders with an envious ease. Lady Bird finds its greatest performer, however, in Laurie Metcalf, playing Christine’s exasperated, yet bullishly strong-willed mother. Metcalf’s performance is simply astounding, her final scene enough to bring anyone to tears and rivalling Patricia Arquette’s Oscar-winning matriarch in Boyhood. Scenes between Ronan and Metcalf are some of the best in the film, sharply written and sometimes painfully relatable. The movie is backed up by a talented supporting cast, including a gentle father in Tracy Letts and Beanie Feldstein showing great comedic timing as Lady Bird’s insecure best friend, Julie.
There is something very beautiful about Lady Bird; it’s a very understated film yet has an unparalleled effect in entirely immersing its audience within the lives of its characters. It’s wonderfully funny, intelligently constructed and has an emotional core that is never loudly exclaimed but is always deeply affecting. A stunning film, Lady Bird leaves me hungry for more from Greta Gerwig."

I really did not anticipate being so blown away by how good it was, I thought it was going to be a live-action version of Pixar's Brave (which I hated).
A dude watching this probably will not understand or relate to the content at all, because it is such a nuanced, tender, and patient exploration of the relationship between a mother and daughter. But don't for a minute think this is a lighthearted 'chick-flick' - it's much more akin to something like Whiplash (the less violent, female version) in its focus on the relationship between two very imperfect people and how it affects your life for better or worse.

It's the kind of film you know probably doesn't end well, so you just enjoy the good times while they last. The movie itself seems to feel the same way, lingering in those sweet moments of quiet memory and cozy togetherness for as long as it can, delaying the inevitable. Of course, eventually something has to give, and then it's a crushing landslide of sudden public interest and consequence, hitting all the harder for the delicate harmony that existed, so freely, prior to the vortex.

O desenvolvimento dos personagens é muito bem feito, estabelecendo muito bem o que eles fazem, porque fazem, e suas consequências. O filme me pareceu lendo a principio, mas cada dialogo tem sua importância narrativa, cujo dá alicerce para as atitudes dos pais, e no futuro dos filhos, que vivem sobre suas influencias. O próprio conceito de família entra em pauta aqui, questionando a visão conservadora, por exemplo.

""Shoplifters"" é um drama complexo, profundo e real que explora a humanidade com uma sutileza quase incomoda, que nos põe pra pensar e se enxergar em tal situação, elevando o ceticismo do consentimento moral de forma muito amena. A direção também é muito atenta, e não subestima o publico com respostas fáceis. ""basta prestar atenção"". Os cortes são uma grande característica disso.

736,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shoplifters/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,AndrewBurge,"Mar 28, 2019",9,"Hirokazu Koreeda's ""Shoplifters"" is the most human film of the year. All more impressive given the fact that it takes place in Tokyo, one of the most advanced and 'robotic' places on Earth. But perhaps this is what gives it power.

The plot is simple enough. A family of small-time crooks decide to take in a child they find outside in the cold--thanks for formulating it for me, IMDB. Her name is Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), still in pre-school. As she slowly blends in with the family, Koreeda pulls us into their small hovel in which they all live crowded on top of each other. But they are happy! I started to ask myself, so what's the problem, exactly? And here it is what this film does best!

Its subtle, it pulls you inside a comfortable family bubble, and then when you feel at peace, you realize that hold on--what about the girl's parents? What about the police looking for her? You suddenly realize that from an outside point-of-view, what they did to her is bad. Instead of returning her to her family, they unofficially adopted her. But Yuri is also reluctant to return home as her parents are neglecting her.

Slowly, two contradicting moral and social views arise yet you can't help but feel that despite the condition in which she leaves, Yuri is better off with her artificial family. But if this were to be part of the news on TV you would definitely not feel the same--I know I wouldn't. Koreeda is using the film's personal and insight view as a means of compelling our morality to offset our ration. But this is not surprising. As an art form, films are made to adhere to our emotions rather than our mind.

There are many great moments in this film, most, although not all, coming from the relationship of this family. I will not spoil them here because they are too many but more importantly they are to be experienced first hand. No surprising plot twists whats-o-ever just pure, personal, relatable humanity."

Manbiki Kazoku

Koreeda is a skillful writer weaving out set pieces in his words that are individually captivating in its entirety. And the result is one long satisfying stay. You feel like a guest entering his world and he welcomes you with open arms. He is a host that respects the boundaries and sculpts the antics accordingly. To be honest, his film is split into only two acts. It all starts with Yuri (Muyi Sasaki) accepting the house as a guest and the response she gets from each member of the house. Picking out a string of an equation of each member of the family with her, the act spirals out series of sequences that brick by brick constructs a suave strong bonding in the risky yet overprotective house.

And on the other side, the second act, is completely opposite, it deconstructs those already established rumors, with the help of the clues spread around in its first act, and the fire catches slowly and poetically. The characters start questioning things that we- the audience- have been questioning from the first frame, and this connection has its own merits, it feels incredibly cathartic to dance in sync with the characters. Aki played by Mayu Matsuoka has the strongest role to portray, particularly since she is away from all the razzle dazzle that this family goes through.

And yet spiritually she finds the same mirror to confront herself in. Her bonding with her grandmother that isn't actually explored thoroughly in the film is actually subjected to Sasaki's character that is in her initial stages of this grand welcome of the family; a masterstroke by the writer. Osamu (Lily Franky) and Shota (Jyo Kairi), the core relationship of the film pins down the fragility of the responsibility that a teacher or an idol carries but personally I loved his equation with Aki (Sakura Ando) as it never fully conjures the screen.

There is a lot that they have been through and evidently a lot we have to catch up with, the decision maker and the hard worker and the nature versus nurture, these improvements raised in early stages makes it more shady and juicy. And Ando as a protective guardian to this family has performed majestically, her confessional scenes- and there are plenty- can reason out of the room, the moment when she finally accepts Sasaki as her daughter and burns her clothes, is one of the best scene of the film.

It projects not only her willful right and the command over the spirit but also her confident to be a parent; a powerful scene sincerely fabricated by equally powerful performance. Koreeda's world is actually too diplomatic to be cinematic, yet his meticulous script that glorifies tiny characteristics of the scenario, brings out an exhilarating experience from us. This is a sort of script that thrives upon various elements, collecting them like coins, Koreeda is on a sprint for a marathon where at the end of the line, these Shoplifters are more humans even though less civilized."

The films starts in a store, where 2 of them are stealing food, but expands when they bring home a young girl who's alone and scared. As she's integrated into their lives, their daily activities are presented with an underplayed naturalness. The performances are reserved, yet compelling. The film is quietly paced and develops their connections with patience. Low-key by American standards, but sweetly sensitive and ultimately touching. In Japanese with subtitles."

A deeply moving film about love, friendship and family. I experienced too many emotions during this film and I don’t know how to handle them.

A family of small time criminals come across a young girl one night in the freezing cold. Although they barely have enough as it is they decide to keep the girl and raise her as their own. You’re not immediately sure how these people are related to each other but nonetheless they are a family. Not at all what I was expecting with some surprisingly dark turns. Beautiful and devastating. There is so much more to Shoplifters the more you watch it, and by the end you’ll still be thinking about this film. Heartbreaking, and highly recommended."

749,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shoplifters/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,IsaacJ,"Jan 1, 2019",9,"Hirokazu Kore-eda has been heralded as an unsung hero of current direction, a modern day Yasujiro Ozu, who has seen success both in his home country of Japan and overseas. His new picture, Shoplifters, has garnered widespread critical acclaim, winning the coveted Palme D'Or at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.
Having seen this film, I can only say that Shoplifters is thoroughly deserving of its praise; here, Kore-eda has succeeded in crafting a subtle, yet affecting film, detailing the story of a band of marginalised thieves, forced to shoplift to get by in a poverty-stricken corner of Tokyo.
What is perhaps most striking about Shoplifters is how it manages to be so profound, yet at the same time being so understated. Like many of the director's films, family lies at the heart of this, though in often darker and more twisted ways than one might expect. Osamu (played with a **** edge by Lily Franky) and his wife, Nobuyo (a captivating Sakura Ando) are exploitative both in their relationship with the elderly Hatsue (Kirin Kiki), whose pension they abuse, and with the young waifs they take in (kidnap or save? this is left suitably ambiguous). There is a definite air of darkness that hangs about the film, yet, even in the bleakest moments, there is a tenderness too, with many scenes showing the endearing ways in which the ""family"" bond with and depend on eachother, especially after taking in the abused youngster, Yuri (Miyu Sasaki).
The picture is also beautifully shot, Ryuto Kondo's artistic cinematography assuaging the drama and aiding the film's subtlety and beauty. Most scenes are long and languid, the dialogue effortless and naturalistic and executed by a talented and, even against the odds, likeable ensemble. Credit should also be given to Shoplifters for never glossing over its themes; young Aki's employment in a hostess club and the abuse suffered by Yuri lie in the background, understated, yet profoundly affecting. The themes of the film are complex, blurring the lines of morality and responsibility, yet it never feels heavy; Kore-eda is letting his audience form their own opinion about the issues represented. What Shoplifters may lack in clear plot, it makes up for in rich and fleshed out characters and sharp writing, which ranges from witty to silently poignant. The film rambles a little in a more cluttered third act, but this is made up by an utterly heart-breaking coda.
With Shoplifters, Hirokazu Kore-eda has crafted a near perfect picture, elegantly executed and quietly moving, with an important and incredibly human message at its core"
750,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shoplifters/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Brent_Marchant,"Dec 30, 2018",7,"After a painfully slow first hour, this Japanese comedy-drama about unconventional family life redeems itself in its second half, with heart-tugging emotion and stunning revelations. While there are hints of what's to come in the first half, the pacing, unfortunately, is a little too tedious to justify the slow-moving manner in which director Hirokazu Koreada tells his story. Despite the many accolades this release has earned at film festivals and in awards competitions, it's too bad that the picture lacks the consistency it needs to make it a better offering overall."
751,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shoplifters/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,NightReviews,"Dec 26, 2018",10,"Shoplifters by Hirokazu Koreeda is one of the most beautiful portraits of the family household and its elements ever graced on-screen, and yes, that is how I am starting this review. While the last little while has been an array of firsts, experiencing a Koreeda film, I found myself recalling immortal auteurs like Yasujiro Ozu with his “seasons” series of melodramas, chiefly revolving around domestic trials and tribulations of man and humanity itself. At times I found it played like a Vittorio De Sica film, sprawling with driven poverty and poetic synthesis, proving on being a companion piece to his infamous Bicycle Thieves. While this film is already in the company of great films, winning the Palme D’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, Shoplifters is absolutely spellbinding! It’s a film that is reviving the idea that modern cinema can move and transcend audiences in the most simplistic and organic of settings and motions. In my humblest and sincerest personal opinion, classic French, Italian and Japanese cinema produces truly spiritual, dreamlike cinematic material. Works from these countries articulate family, love, and spirituality through a lens that is equally transformative yet daringly raw and different from Western cinema. Ringing true to the genuine human condition than anything I have seen from Hollywood, Shoplifters is a film that has shifted my opinion on modern directors and modern cinema as a whole. With Shoplifter’s we are truly drawn to a familiar world where the lens provides a gaze though the eyes of a real auteur. While I always disregarded the notion that anything shot with a modern camera in modern settings could materialize into the type of work that Kurosawa or Ozu have created, I have always believed filmmakers like these have unmatched qualities, until now. Koreeda’s extreme sense of self-awareness and implementing a strong social dynamic, the characters and narrative of Shoplifters blossoms into a truly hearty cinematic experience.

Although the story and narrative of Shoplifters really has no real importance, this is a film that truly draws from its actors and their interactions, to create a family that really delves into the depths of complex moral issues, bonds of love and the ideas of nature versus nurture, that hasn’t been seen in film for many years. Yet, the casting in the film is perhaps, and although this may be a wholly bold statement, the best casting I have seen in at least a decade. Ranging from young child actors to older and respected Japanese acting icons, each familial role is worked and managed into broken down fibres of relatable family members we have in our own lives.

The film tells the story of the Shibata’s. Osamu Shibata, played by Lily Franky, the real patriarch of the family, provides the film with the majority of its humour, especially when he is teaching his ‘children’ the fine ‘art’ of theft. Early on, we see that he passes on his skills to his ‘son’ Shota played exceptionally well by Jyo Kairi. Relentless and effortless, the two are shown to be very close and possessing so many of the dynamics seen between a father and son relationship we have come to expect in film. Shota’s mother, Nobuyo (Sakura Hando) works at a dry cleaners providing her share for the family, also engaging in forms of theft. Nobuyo’s sister Aki (May Matsuoka) works at a soft-core gentlemen’s cyber club performing for her dividend. All of the finances rendezvous at the flat the family stays in tucked away in an extremely quiet neighborhood. A large chunk of the rent that comes along with space is paid for by the true matriarch of the household, Grandmother Hatsue, played tirelessly by Kirin Kiki, who recently passed at the tender age of seventy-five.

While each character’s role is paramount in expressing the moral teachings in Koreeda’s perfectly woven story, there is a firm affinity for Koreeda’s sense of family and togetherness that does not go unnoticed. Each family member play each of their respectable roles honestly, spreading words and dialogue that ceases to shy from the harsh realities of such a lifestyle, yet brilliantly completely shatter society’s belittling and scoffing nature towards them by being individual embodiments of humanity at all stages and ages of life.

The family begins to change its dynamic when Osamu and Shota walk home one evening from a routine shoplift, and find Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), a small child left in the barren waste of her broken family’s home. Together, the two males bring Yuri back home, and the family agrees to keep her safe and make her one of them, a Shibata, due to their parents physical, emotional and mental abuse that can be heard from the open windows of their home."

It takes patience and openness to other cultures and circumstances. I found it riveting, but without highs and lows or melodrama. It steals your soul as effortlessly as the “family” in the film steals crisps from the local convenience store."
753,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shoplifters/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,KeithDow,"Dec 12, 2018",8,"'Shoplifters' notably won the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year, the first Japanese film to do so since 1997's 'The Eel.'  It has since gone on to win 11 other awards and was recently nominated by the Golden Globes for Best Foreign Language Motion Picture.

The merit for all these accolades isn't immediately apparent to audiences when initially delving into the picture, which features a small but close-knit family unit reliant on shoplifting and other petty crimes to survive.

However, the film becomes more and more engrossing as the ties that bond the characters together are further tested and examined.  Additionally, since domestic audiences aren't familiar with the actors, it lends an incredible amount of authenticity to their roles, further amplified by writer/director Hirokazu Koreeda's impeccable camera placement.

In the end, this isn't a film that leaves you either exhilarated or exhausted when exiting the theater.  Contemplative, perhaps, is the best way to describe it, lingering well beyond when the other emotions have already faded away."

It juxtaposes real human connection to conventional conceptions of family in a way that is so powerful.

Its not permanently laugh out loud funny but there are some pretty funny scenes and it focusses on social awkwardness, primarily for the career focussed daughter, Ines, so if you don't like cringe-y moments then this may not be for you (the comedy is sometimes slapstick in nature). Its fair to say she finds herself having to deal with a father who is a practical joker, a tease of sorts, which doesn't necessarily go down well when she's with important colleagues and clients. I enjoyed this film. I was surprised there was so much English present actually as I'd assumed it to be primarily German but there are a number of scenes featuring people representing companies who speak English, so perhaps if your curious about watching foreign language films, this is a half way house a bit, as its not exclusively in a foreign language? (perhaps a third of the film is in English, something like that) having said that, I can't not point out that it is a long watch at almost 2 and three quarter hours long but I certainly enjoyed it and didn't find myself wishing it would end anytime soon, which means its a pretty good film in my book. I would recommend this film, yes."

759,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Reginthorn,"Mar 16, 2017",7,"I am unsure of how I feel about Toni Erdmann. On the one hand, Toni Erdmann is a film with a huge heart. The premise is simple enough to follow. Essentially, a father (Winfried Conradi), in an existential crisis of sorts, uses an alter ego in order to reconnect with his corporate-driven daughter. The corporation Conradi’s daughter works for is as stereotypically capitalistic as it gets. The film utilizes the process of globalization and corporate culture as a means to amplify the disconnect in the father/daughter relationship. The viewer gets the sense Winfriend was a hippie back in the day. Toni Erdmann often works because the characters are extremely complex. I enjoy films in which the characters exist without an explicit concern for audience expectations. Primary or secondary characters often ramble about subjects which are not necessarily tied to the main narrative. In these moments, the camera will focus on setting up characters in the background or illustrate the state of the speaker’s mind. The fictional events on screen are shown to be natural slices of life. Conradi is only predictable in that he is desperate to reconnect with his daughter, Ines. Often, Conradi as Toni Erdmann resorts to pranks in an attempt to goad out some repressed nature in Ines. Humor organically flows in the awkward situations Erdmann flings into. In short, Toni Erdmann has many moments which are pure comedy gold. The core nature of Toni Erdmann’s (the film) humor is laid bare near the film’s climax. The faults of Toni Erdmann, unfortunately, stem from some of the films’ strengths. As primarily a drama, the humor is inconsistent in where and how long it occurs. The film also allows characters a little too much breathing time. After a key moment, the camera decides it wants to follow the characters around. The argument could be said the choice aides in giving the characters an added depth towards physicality. By physicality, I mean the subtle body languages in a character. However, Toni Erdmann is an almost three-hour affair. A lot of people walked out around the film’s halfway point. Personally, I walked out of the theatre wishing the director had opted to cut about thirty minutes. Character development is at times made explicit in narrative exposition. As a result, the extra attention to body language feels a bit redundant. I might be being a little harsh due to my unfamiliarity with German cinema. Ultimately, I think the film was worth my time."

Also, you need to be patient. And in the right mood. But if you are, if you are a busy person with constant dilemmas between the personal and the professional, you will love the movie. The acting is superb, the story is deep and, because of the length of the film, the characters were developed with incredible depth."
761,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GinaK,"Feb 27, 2017",9,"I think this is a fascinating film, and one of the best things about it is how the audience gradually caught on to what Inez’s estranged (and strange) father was trying to do here – give his daughter a sense of balance and perspective about life. And at the end, she is still not quite convinced, I think, but I don’t want to include any plot spoilers. However, I think he has helped her (and us) make considerable progress toward understanding her/our own worth and desires. I guess its length is a problem for an American audience, but it is a movie like “Magnolia,” where you just have to surrender and “go with it” to enjoy it.  And I have to confess that I’ve sat through a lot of Wagnerian operas, so listening to incomprehensible German and reading subtitles is not such a shock to me. If you try to relax and enjoy it and not be judgmental (like Inez), the action and craziness will carry you along, and I think you will find it rewarding. It’s a movie I will not soon forget, both for its craziness and for its message. I actually might want to see it again!"
762,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DirigiblePulp,"Feb 25, 2017",8,"Truly, a comedy epic. Ok, that's mostly the length of the film talking. This is a classic high-concept comedy premise that's so deeply rooted in real human emotion that it only feels outlandish on reflection afterwards.

Quite a bit has been said about the way in which the film refuses to conform to the typical route one like this would take - that of a woman finding a man, realizing she's a Type-A corporate **** who just needs to shut up and be a wife/mom, and all without ever explicitly stating that fact but implying it every step of the way.

Instead, this film meanders and wanders and roams and keeps finding ways to surprise and tickle. The jokes are long cons, ones with mostly huge payoffs. That Ines reaches her revelation both as a result of her father's antics and also her own self-realization feels especially real. What she needed was not so much a change of heart but to be surrounded by one decent person. It's the fault of other corporate cronies and sexist buffoons. It is a slight twist on the formula that makes it near revelatory. The ending eschews trite resolution, suggesting that happiness isn't magically forever after some grand realization but that it is comprised of moments and the mere ability to see that and experience that with someone you love is in itself revelation enough.

I would have preferred less slack direction in regards to the showy-unshowy ""realism"" camera work and scene pacing. There are some scenes that seem shot for no reason whatsoever and others that end abruptly or at absurdly inconvenient times. In short, it tries to be too cute with its form. I'm thinking in particular of the ending where Ines has a naked brunch (my lord when Toni shows up in that costume - haven't heard an audience laugh like that in while) and hilarity ensues as people show up naked until it ends with a well-timed hand on a shoulder. Suddenly people are putting on clothes and Toni leaves and Ines chases and there's no reason for any of it and the scene still had so much more to give. Then there's a strange long-winded follow-through in a park and a little girl and finally a hotel clerk pulling off a mask. A tighter sense of story there (and elsewhere) and we could be talking masterpiece."
763,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"Feb 14, 2017",7,"What do you think is worth living for?

I had tough time to figure it out what was the thing on the poster. Seeing it upside down, with mirror, name it, I used all the tricks I know, but nothing had worked. On the other hand, I thought it might be a fantasy film with a King Kong like creature. That's the curiosity it created, people to a have different opinions and forget to expect from the film. But it was a simple comedy-drama and only way to solve the mystery is to watch the film. That's what I finally did.

The opening scene was good. But I did not think the whole film would be like that. It was about a prankster and his attempts to reach his workaholic daughter, which was the entire narration. A lifetime trip for them, that's not about the challenges in the world or the nature, but their self-discovery, the meaning of life and purpose. This is one of the beautiful films to open up about a father and daughter relationship. In the grown-up world, the people forget to live the actual life, when they give all the focus to their professional life.

I have to agree, this is a competitive world and you will be replaced by millions of other waiting behind you for such opportunity. But does it all worth doing is the real question. Doubts like that won't arise without those who love us pointing it out. It needs to be asked properly, politely. But some people take an alternate route like in this film. Sometimes it ends in an unexpected adventure to just realise what they are into. And this film was honest, to reveal as much as it can in many angles.

This is the story of Winfried. An aged and divorced music teacher who makes practical jokes to people around him. After his dog died, he decides to reconnect with his only daughter Ines, who is now working in Romania. She is on the cusp to get her desired position in the office. On her one final push for that, is now getting distracted by her father. She who never understood her father's way of life, tries to get an answer out of him about the life. So that's where their journey begins. Some of the bold steps taken by them, the film accomplishes what it wanted to tell us in a unique way.

""The problem is it's so often about getting things done. You do this, You do that. And in the meantime, life just passes by.""

The film was actually loosely based by the director's own father. The writing was brilliant. It reminded me 'Infinitely Polar Bear', because these women directors inspired by their fathers to show the world how their childhood was like. The actors were amazing, particularly those two in the main roles. I liked them both equally. From the different angle, they have given different performances. There's no surprise if you liked the film only because of them.

The film had won many prestigious awards around the globe and now its biggest stand off is at the 2017 Oscars which is a few weeks away. Another Scandinavian film, which is also nominated for the Oscar, is also about an old man like this one. But I think 'Under Sandet' is the frontrunner for the golden statue. Because we all know that America's and Academy's sentimental towards the WWII.

When it comes to rating, the film is strictly for adults. It was good in the initial parts, but there are some surprise nude and sex scenes. At that time I thought it lost its path, but actually that was the turning point where you are going to witness a different half of the film. Surely many people going love the second half more than the first.

At first, it looked like it is a German version of 'The Family Fang', but only more realistic with dark humour. It's difficult to understand every scene, especially in the first watch. Because without knowing the film characters, the events involving them look casual. Capable to get the sense of humour is the key here. So if you decide for the second time viewing, you will learn more about it. It is one of those films that second time watch necessary for some people.

Frankly, I did not think it was a great film, just after finish my watch. But thinking back about all those film events, made sense. By the time I decided to write this review, I was in its favour. That's the reason I won't write about the films right away. This is a great film, but you have to focus closely and understand everything, then you will have a great time. But remember, it is one of the longest film in the recent time, particularly for a comedy-drama, yet enjoyable. Recommended!

Billed as a comedy, it is tears-running down-your-face hilarious at certain times, drolly funny elsewhere, slyly satirical at other times, sometimes just plain quirky and even squirmy-uncomfortable in places. It's always interesting, though, and maybe even brilliant. At its core, Toni Erdmann is about core values, both personal and societal; about shifting power relationships in the workplace and within families; and about a father's love for his adult daughter and his struggle to find a way to connect with her. Critics love it, I think, for its subtlety, its unpredictability, and its blending or mashing of genres: comedy, social criticism, family drama, and even a dash of weepy melodrama. Plus, the performances of Peter Simonischek as Winfried/Toni and Sandra Hiller as his daughter, Ines, are sharp and completely believable."

This movie is full of anxiety, suspense and action in perfect Safdie's style, and from the start to the end it is entertaining as hell. This movie may be less engaging on an emotional level if compared to his smaller brother ""Good Time"" because you can't feel empathy for any of the characters here.

Uncut Gems is a high-anxiety thrill ride from start to finish.

It centers on the life of Howard Ratner, an ambitious jeweller who makes the biggest bet of his life - in the hope that his various personal and financial problems will cease to exist. Watching this film is like going on a rollercoaster. The movie progresses at a rapid pace, and you sit helplessly as you watch Ratner fall further into the abyss with every poor choice that he makes. There are moments when you cheer, as well as moments when you close your eyes in fear. Like the end of such a rollercoaster ride, the ending of this movie will leave you winded. Undoubtedly, the main highlight of the movie is Adam Sandler's scintillating performance as the troubled jeweller.

'Uncut Gems' is an absolutely thoroughly thrilling watch, the plot is so chaotic and high paced that it's practically impossible to not have a fun time with it. The cast do terrific work, typified by the tremendous Adam Sandler.

Sandler (Howard) is unquestionably the star of the film, he gets a lot of stick for a lot of the roles he usually plays but this is far from anything I've seen him portray. He still shows his funny side no doubt, but he adds much more to make it a memorable character - which is a rarity for him.

Lakeith Stanfield, Julia Fox, Kevin Garnett and Eric Bogosian are all good too. The score is pretty solid, also. There isn't much more to note really, it's a crime thriller and it absolutely nails that realm. Great film."

The biggest reason for that is its anxiety inducing musical score, sometimes intense dialogue and the hectic way the movie was filmed. Even after saying all that, this movie was my niche and one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The last few minutes were the most intense final moments in any movie I have ever experienced, you really are going to be at the edge of your seat and making the whole anxiety induced experience worth it. Surprisingly is also funny at times, which is good for its pacing. When Adam Sandler does drama, he's at his best and really hope this is his career going forward. The whole movie has an iconic look and aesthetic going for it, its hard to compare it with anything and it will be talked about for years to come.

A disclaimer: I watched the movie at home, not in a theater. I had to stop it more than once. I am glad I did it that way. This relentless excitement is definitely not for everyone.
The protagonist Howard Ratner is a shady New York jeweller with so many sins (a liar, a cheat, a gambler, a scam, etc. etc.) yet so profoundly human, hoping to finally make it and win big.

Imagine the movie Good Time but two steps less claustrophobic and instead of an outright criminal, the main character is just a super sleazy gambler. Thais Uncut Gems. The wild ride that was the plot of this film almost never let off the gas. Even when it did, there was clearly something just about to boil over the edge. Sandler played this role perfectly but really, much of his performance should be credited to the brilliant script writing here. This is a story about a sniffling, cheating, pathetic gambler and even though he shows these characteristics throughout the film, there are just enough tidbits of humanity shown to endear you to him. The camera and the score really match up well with the character in this film. The frame will often move just as frantically as Sandler, with a reverberating, pulsing, electronic score underneath such scenes - seemingly matching up with the rhythm of every step in the main character's plan passing through his head one at a time. There's much more to say, but I won't spoil. This will be on Netflix on then 31st for anyone that missed it in theaters. Check it out then."

I genuinely have not felt as much anxiety and stress in a movie all 2019 and 2020 (So Far). The Safdie brothers are masters of anxiety inducing filmmaking, I definitely felt their style take hold of me in their film Good Time released in 2017. But while I thought Good Time was fantastic, it still felt like an appetizer of what the Safdie brothers could do. And I’m glad to tell y’all, Uncut Gems is the main gourmet course. I’ve seen this film 4 times in the cinema, and It still never feels like a waste of my money and time. Josh & Benny Safdie bring their anxiety and stress-inducing filmmaking to another level with Uncut Gems, and craft a genuinely compelling and off the wall story, with a masterfully written screenplay. And this film is brought to life by the amazing performances of the entire cast, primarily made up of first time actors who kill it in their first film (Kevin Garnett, Julia Fox). Kevin Garnett, one of the best basketball players of the last decade is genuinely fantastic and convincing in his performance, and Julia Fox is just masterful in her first ever film performance as Howard’s mistress Julia De Fiore. Lakeith Stanfield is proving to be one of the best actors working today (even if he’s just in a minor role), he is excellent as Howard’s estranged employee Demany. But we can not talk about phenomenal performances without bringing up the centerpiece of this film.. MR. ADAM SANDLER. I’ve said it and I’ll say it again, Adam Sandler was severely snubbed for a Best Actor nomination from The Academy. Adam Sandler, who is known for his ridiculous and pretty terrible comedies, takes a break from those, and shows us when the man want to deliver a thrilling performance, he most certainly can. The way Adam in-bodies Howard Ratner, a scumbag and risk taking New York City jeweler and bet placer. Howard continuously makes bad decisions and bets, meanwhile having a family and an impending divorce with his wife Dinah Ratner. Howard also owes over 100,000 to a very violent and ruthless loan shark named Arno. Even after Howard actually places a winning bet on Kevin Garnett’s performance in the Celtics game, Arno cancels the bet and has his goons strip Howard and leaves him naked outside his child’s school, forcing his wife Dinah to retrieve him. Like I said, this film is extremely anxiety inducing, this film & it’s 2 directors want to take your nerve endings and destroy them, and then replace them with new nerve endings, so they can destroy your nerve endings again. The film’s ending is tragic, but expected. Howard finally makes a winning bet, and actually wins millions of dollars. But Phil (one of Arno’s toughest goons) kills Howard and we see Julia leaving with Howard’s millions. Which IMO, was the perfect ending to this crazy story. IMO, this is not just one of the best films of 2019, but one of the best of the entire decade and might become one of my favorite crime movies ever made. Adam Sandler’s performance is one for the ages, and I hope to see him take these amazing dramatic roles  more frequently. This is 100% a must see for anybody who calls themselves a Cinephile, a nerve ending killer, with fantastic performances from the entire cast, and a decade defining screenplay and story from the Safdie brothers (Benny & Josh Safdie). Please see this film immediately, and please rent and/or buy the movie on Blu-Ray! A 10/10 from me, and I am so glad I get to be alive in a generation where cinema like this exists. Films like this inspire me to continue my passion for filmmaking, and reminds me why I love the art form of Film so much!!- Will Herren (April 22, 2020)"

I knew after seeing him in Punch Drunk Love he was very talented and he's just incredible in this. For me this is a tragic tale of how worldly greed and obsession with beauty can ultimately lead to unhappiness. Sandler's Mistress in the movie is the same as the gem he's obsessed with, dangerous and unobtainable. He's a man that has everything but still wants more. He's a man that lusts after excitement and novelty and disregards what he always has. By the end of the film the message is clear. Don't! Everything about this film is perfect. The music, the acting, the pacing. There's so much going on underneath the surface too thematically. I'm still finding hidden meaning in it. A masterpiece"

You can really sense the addiction that the character feels by the end of it where you being rooting yourself. It really is a heart pumping adrenal rush.

816,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/uncut-gems/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TheQuietGamer,"Mar 28, 2020",9,"Adam Sandler finally has a movie to compete with Punch-Drunk Love. This is essentially the story of one man's self-destructive downward spiral. Our lead starts things off in an already bad position and the situation only gets worse for him from there. At first you think he's just an unlucky idiot, but as the film progresses you realize that he's making these bad decisions on purpose and intentionally digging himself into a deeper hole. All because he believes that if he just keeps on digging he'll eventually break through to the other side and come out on top with the ultimate win. The man has a genuine sickness.

Yet, despite all of this he's actually kind of likable. Maybe it's just because of Sandler, but even at his loudest and most obnoxious (there's a lot of yelling in this) I couldn't help but root for the guy. I wanted to see him succeed and find a way out of this mess. Which is what made it so compelling to keep watching in spite of all the frustration that arose from seeing the character acquire a means of walking away and refusing to use it.

Of course it also helps that it's stylish as heck. With its synth-soundtrack and occasionally psychedelic 35mm visuals, this a treat for both the eyes and the ears. It kind of reminds me of Nightcrawler in that everything looks grainy, yet gorgeous like a sleazy '80s flick. The whole thing feels so much grittier because of it.

What's crazy is that this does so many of the same things we criticize some of the most notoriously bad movies for, like having needless subplots that don't go anywhere. For example the film opens with Sandler getting a colonoscopy. Presumably so that at some point it can be revealed he has cancer on top of everything else going on. But when the doctor does finally call him with the results around an hour or so later into the running-time he tells him that everything's fine and it's never brought up again. What was the point of that? We also learn that the protagonist owes money to a second dude that he tries to pay off with a fake Rolex. The guy shows up again in a few other scenes to get some form of actual payment, but he just gets ignored and I'm left wondering why he's even in this at all.

However, where that sort of thing doesn't work in other movies, here it does. That's because the Safdie brothers are just that talented as directors. The way the danger builds to an unforgettable finale where what would normally be a tension free event becomes a teeth-clenching, seat-gripping nightmare of anticipation makes Uncut Gems darn near a masterpiece. To the point where after having just finished it I immediately thought about watching it again."

There's some nice cinematography and camerawork, some nice editing choices, some nice visuals, some nice music, and the performances were great. This is an unpopular opinion but while Adam Sandler was good I don't think he had one of the best performances of the year. It's different compared to his other **** movies but he was good. I think I found interesting the ""chaotic"" nature of this movie, with so many scenes having crowded rooms with so much screaming and yelling that it is almost incomprehensible at times. It's not a flaw, in fact, I liked that direction and it fits the tone of the movie, so, good job.

I feel like the story at its core it's pretty simple but the way it's presented is...Convoluted? It's a messy movie. If you don't pay a lot of attention from the very beggining you will be lost. I would like to think that's the style of the directors, that's how they tell stories (I haven't seen Good Time), but it just wasn't my cup of tea and in my opinion, some scenes and plot points could've been shorter. I loved the final act, it was pretty intense and engaging even if the ending it's the most predictable thing in the world.

Overall, it's definetely an interesting movie but it's not something I would rewatch any time soon. Maybe I'm an idiot and I didn't get the movie, so I still recommend it because like I said, it has some interesting elements and you might think it's the best movie of the year and whatever."

The film is about a small family of two little kids and their parents, but all the focus was on the mother who is a drug addict and struggling with mental illness, yet care a lot for her children. But how long this happy family stays that way is the film going to reveal in its entire narration.

Based on the book of the same name, half a million budget film, has a decent cast who have given their best for it. This is not a film you watch to enjoy, but a film about the families around us. This is a depiction of the real world story, like not all the families are happier as we see them from the outside. There are some secrets in them, which sets a bad example for their own children once they come to know the true nature of their parents. But some would decide to fight hard to make everything come back to the normal and some won't. That is where film derives, how it all ends makes this film unique from the other similar ones.

I think this film was decent with an important topic. Not everyone would end up happy with their watch, because the story won't end up as they thought. The novel was written by a woman, so this is a woman's perspective tale and quite neatly told story. Not a bad direction or the screenplay, surprising the production quality was too good. Seems it is a quite family type film for involving kids, certainly the theme was very strong, so definitely for adults only. It is neither worth nor a waste of time, only if you come across to it and has no other choice, you can give it try.

6.5/10"

824,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-smile-back/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,NightReviews,"Feb 3, 2016",7,"One of the most fascinating and wholly satisfying moments of Hollywood cinema is being present during that moment when a prominent and famous comedy actor transitions from their comfortable, recognizable and iconic genre to that of a raw and unglamorous dramatic role. Luckily for us, such is the case for the quick witted, dirtied tongue comedy actress Sarah Silverman, in her latest film I Smile Back.

Silverman, who completely transforms her usual charm and infamous devilish smile in favour of Laney Brooks, is revelatory as a woman who suffers from a chemical imbalance and deep rooted physiological issues that greatly affect the people she loves most around her.

The self-destructive archetype is not uncommon in the American indie film scene, yet, Silverman brings a new high to a character relishing in the ultimate lows.

Supported by her loving insurance selling husband Bruce Brooks (Josh Charles) and her adorable children Eli (Skylar Gaetner) and Janey (Shayne Coleman), Laney is a ticking time bomb of insecurity, trouble and instability. Regardless of their efforts to induct Laney into rehabilitation for her drug use, her obvious daddy issues and secret double life as a violent, punishment seeking nymphomaniac, Laney tries over and over again to fit in without much success.

I Smile Back, a novel by Amy Koppelman, written for the screen by Koppelman and Paige Dylan, is the ultimate Silverman shedding her comedy skin drama vehicle. Every aspect of the film is held together, driven forward and rewarded by the strong performance of Silverman. Whether she’s on the floor tripping out, cutting the crusts off her children’s peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, or finding solace in a wellness centre, Silverman’s role unabashedly demands our attention. Silverman’s performance is a big smile and hit in the right direction for a comedy actress no one ever took seriously before.

The film itself, directed by Adam Salky, has its glimmers of interesting commentaries that are mostly left unexplored and empty. The possibility of Laney’s medical imbalance being passed on to her eldest son is one of the few directions that the film takes that the audience is surely interested in. Eli, who begins to show very similar character traits, including flinching eyes, and some signs during a piano recital, are thwarted by Laney’s passion to failure. Not that we are complaining, but I Smile Back is one example of a film where its run-time could have extended a bit longer to blossom these narrative possibilities.

I Smile Back is a daunting character piece on just how much someone is willing (or able) to screw up every aspect of their lives, despite having the most amazing and supportive people around them. Salky, who balances many engrossing images of filth and despicable behaviour by Laney, does a masterful job of juxtaposing beautiful scenes of family when Laney seems to be rehabilitated, including a fantastic family scene involving a cake and some candles.

While the light reminds on, its dim and dark presence seems to overshadow the film as a whole from beginning to end. I Smile Back is a film that allows audiences to face their own personal terrors and allowing yourself to get what you want from them. The feature is a personal reflection of the things we want to see in ourselves, and the disgusting character traits we can help but ignore.

Lacey’s character goes through the crossroads, literally and figuratively, in calmness and in a frenzy. Like a whirlwind, Silverman is a tycoon of raw and fleshy emotion that isn’t usually expected for a comedienne’s first time dramatic role.

With an impressive supporting cast that includes The Newsroom’s Thomas Sadoski, Terry Kinney as a very real and impressive therapist who delivers some of the best and most quote worthy lines of the film, I Smile Back is a film worth smiling for, despite its heavy handed and opaque exterior. Sadly, Charles is highly underutilized as Laney’s husband and never given his due time. Instead, Charles is just left giving his best impression of Keanu Reeves and serves as a dull supporting character to the vivaciously catastrophic Laney.

Beauty is a hard theme to find in I Smile Back, yet, as Laney’s therapist reassures her in her early stages of her recovery, “Every moment of beauty fades…but, there’s more and more and more of those moments. You just need to be alive to see them”. Dark, depressing and sickened by sadness, I Smile Back may break your heart, but Silverman’s performance will have you smiling back from ear to ear in utter satisfaction."

Its interesting to see the expansion of the character Zac plays in the web series with the talented supporting cast doing a good job with their characters here.

This is a movie that knew what it needed to be: a simple wrapper for the skits themselves. The plot is a throwaway, and that's fine. Those involved know it and treat it with the levity in needs, working in quirky, offbeat humor throughout.

The real gems are the interviews, and they come frequently enough, though a few feel too brief. Stay for the credits gag reel to see some of the funniest jokes that were necessarily cut, as no one could keep a straight face (and viewer laughter would make it difficult to follow the entire interview)."

Overall I was pleasantly surprised with Between Two Ferns: The Movie. I was a big fan of the original videos when they came back out several years ago, but had little faith in it as a movie. The celebrity interviews are a mixed bag. While Galifianakis's character gets in some very funny barbs the interview's heavily, if not entirely, scripted feel doesn't shock due to contemporary shows like The Eric Andre Show or Who Is America. Both of which elicit a mostly genuine responses from the guests. Between Two Ferns: The Movie manages to rectify the so-so quality of the interviews by virtue of the supporting cast and Galifianakis's zany and often amusing interactions between the side characters. Other than when Will Ferrell's character was on screen, it felt like he was **** the comedy out of the room, the sub plot of the movie tended to amuse. While not every joke landed enough did and the charisma of the supporting cast and the Galifianakis (or lack there of for him) more than made up for some of these sections clunkiness. Overall Between Two Ferns: The Movie was solidly amusing and much better than I had expected from a Full length Between Two Ferns feature. I'd recommend it to anyone with Netflix needing a light chuckle especially if they're ready to feel the nostalgia when the Between Two Ferns theme plays."

The myriad cameos are the highlight, with Zach's interviews never failing to provoke genuine comedy. The patchwork story surrounding the interviews is boring and predictable however, even with the wonderful Lauren Lapkus giving it her all in a supporting role. Even with its shortcomings, its still one of the funniest movies released in 2019, and an easy recommendation."

They do go on the road to interview celebrities and run into various snags, but it only feigns the depth of a full blown movie, with certain key turning points, while its heart is really in its gags. If you go in knowing what to expect you will be entertained. Think, The Office, where Galfinakis is the Michael Scott character."

839,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-is-true/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"May 24, 2019",8,"As it seems only the British can do, there are 2 scenes in ""All Is True"" that are master classes in acting which would be expected from Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen but a much younger actress, Kathryn Wilder, gives no quarter in being their equal in one of the most important scenes of the movie.

In the particular scene I am referring to William Shakespeare (Branagh), his wife Anne (Dench) and one their daughters Judith (Wilder) are exposing family truths as the screenwriter Ben Elton imagines they would speak yet bringing it in to today's world. When I had time to think about it later I could just imagine a theatre audience seeing it on stage in a play written today and stunning them.

The other scene, between Shakespeare and Henry Wriothesley, the Earl of Southampton, (McKellen) looks into the supposedly love affair between them when both were young men and Shakespeare wrote his sonnets. At one point, without changing a thing, Shakespeare starts talking by reciting one of his sonnets and the Earl recites it back to him. It is as if the two men, not acting, are having a conversation expressing their feelings. Neither sex nor nudity is involved yet you believe you are seeing and hearing both!

While very little is known of Shakespeare's home life, such as the death of his son, Elton presents a plausible story of what may have taken place for the 3 years that Shakespeare returned home to family life after spending most of his life alone in  London at the Globe Theatre which had burned down in 1613.

The only fault, which made it slow moving for only a 100 minute film, is the director's holding on to many unnecessary and lingering nature scenes with the director being Kenneth Branagh.

""All Is True"" might not all be true but it is certainly worth seeing for the acting alone, which shouldn't be but will probably be forgotten at award time."

858,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/judy-punch/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Bertaut1,"Jun 24, 2020",7,"A fascinating socio-political study of proto-feminism mixed with dark comedy

The debut feature from actress turned writer/director Mirrah Foulkes, Judy & Punch is a darkly comic study in proto-feminism, a strange mixture of Monty Python-esque slapstick and serious social critique, wrapping it all up in an anachronistic and pseudo-magical realist aesthetic. It's a mix that shouldn't work, and, for many, it won't - some will find the tonal balance too skewered towards socio-political protest to work as comedy, others will argue the comic elements undermine the socio-political agenda. For me, I thought Foulkes just about got away with it, helped immeasurably by strong performances and a stunning visual design.

In the English countryside town of Seaside (nowhere near the sea), Judy (Mia Wasikowska) and Punch (Damon Herriman) are a young couple with an infant child. The creators of the Punch & Judy puppet show, Judy is by far the more talented puppeteer, but Punch is a natural showman and a master of self-promotion. Although his inability to control his drinking has led to the show's reputation waning, when he hears that a talent-scout is in the area, he determines to curb his drinking. However, when Punch responds to a horrifying accident by viciously beating Judy, she embarks upon a mission of vengeance.

Judy & Punch is, at least in part, another entry in a subgenre we're seeing more and more of in recent years – gynocentric revenge films directed by women; Coralie Fargeat's Revenge and Jennifer Kent's The Nightingale both spring to mind, but you could also include something like Isabella Eklöf's disturbing Holiday, which is a **** drama without the revenge. Given the title, you know from the get-go that the film isn't going to be thematically subtle. Apart from the town's meek constable Derrick (Benedict Hardie) and Scaramouche (Terry Norris), the senile husband of Maude (Brenda Palmer), Judy and Punch's elderly maid, literally every man in the film is a violent misogynistic thug. I don't bring this up by way of criticism, merely to illustrate that the film wears its themes, very proudly, on its sleeve. The Punch & Judy show itself, which invariably involves Punch beating Judy with a stick (itself not exactly a subtle phallic stand-in), has never been especially coy about its own thematic tropes, so why should a film inverting those tropes be otherwise?

One of Judy & Punch's most obvious strengths is the aesthetic, with its lush and vibrant milieu – a realm that's not quite fantasy, not quite historical reality. The town of Seaside, for all its vivid Renaissance-era squalor, is that of a fairy-tale allegory – the kind you'd expect to see terrorised by a werewolf or a giant. Production designer Josephine Ford's work is especially good, and one half-expects to see a gingerbread house in the background.

Enhancing the surreality is the electronic score by François Tétaz, which has no place in a film of this time-period, but which works wonderfully with the stylistic trappings of Foulkes's weird anachronistic vibe. Equally important here is the dialogue, which is a mixture of period-correct diction and a more modern inflection. Put it this way – at one point, we see a group of characters in Renaissance costumes doing tai chi. If that sounds like something you'd find funny, you'll love this exceptionally-realised world.

The acting is universally terrific. Hardie is terrific as the one good man in a town of troublemakers. But unlike the characters played by Clint Eastwood, Derrick has zero authority and no respect. However, despite his ineffectual nature, Hardie plays him as a completely straight-shooter with real interiority. Wasikowska's Judy isn't just a vehicle for feminist rhetoric, but is a capable and fierce woman in her own right. Herriman initially makes Punch seem contemptible, yet as the film goes on, he makes the character even less likeable.

The film does, however, have some problems. For some, it will be too funny to work as feminist critique, and for others, too serious to work as comedy. Others still might argue it works as neither because it never fully commits to either. The narrative and dialogue are also extraordinarily on the nose on occasion. A few of the themes are also under-explored, including domestic violence, which seems to have been included as a plot point simply because it's an issue in the original show – Foulkes never really takes it anywhere.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed Judy & Punch. A statement on oppression and female (re)assertion, it takes the best-known elements of a world-famous puppet show, and inverts them, turning an inherently misogynistic story into a celebration of early feminism. Allegorical in both visual and narrative design, it may be pantomime-esque, but so too is it compelling enough to turn what could have been dismissed as a nasty fairy-tale into a piece of work which is thematically relevant to the milieu in which we now reside."

Mike Flanagan's adaptation is faithful to a fault to Stephen King's material, while also showing so much reverence for Stanley Kubrick's original film that it's hard for this movie to stand on its own. However, a strong sense of style, solid emotional core, and a wonderfully fun and hammy performance by the very underappreciated Rebecca Ferguson make Doctor Sleep a worthwhile watch for fans of horror, King, and/or Kubrick."

I've heard some say it's a poor vision for a sequel and that it explains things about the first movie that were better left a mystery. In total, it provides poor synergy when paired with The Shining and it suffers as a result. I actually agree with these statements and it is a bit unfortunate this was to be a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's classic. But if we separate Doctor Sleep from its partner and judge it on its own merits, I think we have a pretty good movie. It's a suspenseful film with moments of painful terror, and it has a cast of interesting and diverse characters that make's for great storytelling. In addition to this, it caused my ""sci-fi meter"" to spike as it had some of the best ideas I've seen in a while when it comes to psychics. So if you are one of those who've heard how terrible this movie is as a sequel to The Shining, you've not heard wrong. But there is still a good movie worth enjoying here and as long as you ignore its sequel status and judge it on its own merits, I think you will find that enjoyment."

It's definitely a change compared to the original. The original is much more of a classic horror movie, this one is more of a superhero movie. If you're looking for another scary horror movie, this is not the movie you want to watch. There's a reason this movie is called ""doctor sleep"" and not ""the shining 2"".

If you want to watch a sequel to the shining that gives you more insight into the universe of the shining, I would definitely recommend watching it. It also gives fan service near the end.

Written and directed by Mike Flanagan (of The Haunting of Hill House).


What followed was a fantastic, GORGEOUS movie that felt every bit as exciting and atmospheric as The Haunting of Hill House, what I think to be the greatest works of horror page-to-screen adaptation ever. The visuals of this movie are stellar, all the lead performances are excellent and the callbacks to a film I didn't even like only made me more excited and appreciative of that original work. It made me want to go back and revisit it. Mike Flanagan is the best name in horror and this movie is another thing that proves it."

-S2S: Movie Review

Welcome back to Stream to Big Screen. This week we are glad to have before you a movie adaptation of Stephen King’s thriller, Doctor Sleep. The book, Doctor Sleep, was published in 2013 and filmmakers moved quickly to give the masses the sequel to The Shining they’ve been waiting for. So let’s dive deep into this thriller.

First, the movie is beautiful visually. I did have some qualms with the younger versions of characters used, but that’s not important. Nevertheless, there are some really cool flying/floating/Dr. Strange-like sequences in the movie. The movie has some good CGI technology, but there could have been even more. The storyline is cool even though I got annoyed with the interchangeable nature of their use of the word shining and steam. PICK ONE ALREADY! Sorry for that outburst.

Next, I would’ve appreciated more depth into the explanation of shining, steam, and the individual new characters. This explanation is something that I’m sure, in the novel, Stephen King got into thoroughly. Even without the full look into each character, individually all of the actors did a solid job. Rebecca Ferguson, as Rose The Hat, is simply enchanting. I really enjoyed her performance of the character. Ewan as Danny… not so much. I can’t tell if he did a bad job or the writing and directing was that poor. Either way Ewan needed a do over.

Unfortunately, Doctor Sleep was more of a walk down memory lane than a hotly anticipated horror classic sequel. Nothing is truly creepy about this movie, compared to The Shining, but the viewer does get 2 or 3 eerie or tough moments to view. Mainly, we got some of the classic movie scenes from The Shining, with further detail bringing us to the present, mixed with a completely different storyline. The director relied too much upon the strength of The Shining rather than fully embracing what is cool and creepy about the Doctor Sleep book. In reality, the Doctor Sleep storyline could be way more creepy and enthralling than was displayed. The movie does an okay job giving us to the idea but is far too shallow. The viewer needs more depth and I’m sure the book fans would agree. Flanagan failed to make us dive deep into the movie/pages of the book. What the viewer got was a slightly creepier version of Darkest Minds, Twilight and Hocus Pocus. On top of that, the horror fans would be left wanting by the end of the movie.

Long story short, Doctor Sleep failed in the ways of a horror movie but succeeded in the ways of a teen coming of age superhero origin story. If you’re looking to be scared like The Shining, you will be disappointed but if you come to be entertained and held in suspense, this may be a the movie for you. Horror/Shining fans, I would recommend just catching this on netflix but everyone else I’d recommend a matinee showing, if you have a free 2 hours and 20 minutes on this chilly Veteran’s Day weekend."

But the continuation of the story is very good. I really enjoyed the movie. The last act of the movie makes more sense if you have seen The Shining, but its still enjoyable if you haven't. Hopefully they make a sequel to this film."

It's not really an horror story. I would say it's more a paranormal story, with some sparse gruesome events. Sadly, there are a bit too much dead times (I watch the director cut). The film could have been more focused in terms of rhythm. The acting was really good. The performance of the villains and the main heroes are great. I give it 70%. Mainly because of the actors."

Flanagan has been on a run lately, Oculus was solid horror, Hill House was very popular (I found it boring) and this is a well photographed, nice looking movie.  Alex Essoe does a good impression of Shelly Duvall.  Ewan McGregor does a good job of never steering attention away from story or toward himself.  Snakebite is the most interesting character, besides Abra (Kyliegh Curran) she was great.  There are parts that remind me of The Dark Crystal, in a good way.  Well made, not much action but it never drags at all in 3 hours."

The characters have little backstory, save for Matthew **** Koala.
The ensemble fails often, the time spent on all the characters isnt equal, but the result works insofar as a 'Pitch Perfect' movie doesnt HAVE to give every character 15 minutes of fame.
The songs dont HAVE to impress long, just give each their minute or two.

The plot I didn't find all that predictable and consider it more than adequate, with a solid premise and well thought out characters. The score and the songs were great. The animation was bright, smooth and on point too.

Having seen Frozen II a few days ago, I certainly enjoyed this one a lot more and thought the songs were much better, even if the animation and effects were not as glamorous as in Frozen, everything else like the characters made up for it. If F II was a 6/7 in my book, this is an easy 9 and am looking forward to the sequel and what they do there!"

Ultimately, ""Sing"" wasn't a huge leap forward from ""The Secret Life of Pets"" thanks to its slightly all-over-the-place story, the somewhat unlikeable protagonist, and the fact that Illumination's trademark humor isn't really on display here. However, I'd be lying if I didn't say that ""Sing"" had some beautiful animation, great music, solid vocal performances, heartwarming moments, and other charming characters that helped keep it afloat. Sure, it's a flawed film, and it won't rank as one of Illumination's best, but ""Sing"" is still an enjoyable entry in the company's filmography, and it's definitely worth giving a shot."

The best thing about the movie is the soundtrack and it makes you sing it. The bad: few gags and the predictable and full of clichés that is the plot (above the trailer tells you everything).

Even more than the Despicable Me films. I know I gave criticism at The Wild Life for nothing happening whatsoever, but the reason for that is that it's executed in the most boring way out there. In Sing, nothing has been learned from Wild Life. The only difference is that the execution is much more fun. The story it tells is fun and witty, the animation is really good, and with the massive pile of characters, it's actually hard to pick a favorite. The only problem I have is that it constantly hops from one sub plot from another, which makes hard to focus on what's going on. It's even harder than choosing a favorite character. But despite the lack of focus on the story, it still passes as a fun movie."

It was one of the most watched trailer by me. Yeah, I liked the trailer and teaser, those beautiful songs and characters made me watch this film. Maybe because of that, I thought the trailers looked much better. I enjoyed the film, it had depth in characters than what I saw in the promotional videos. Though it is a simple story, and that worked so well.

Its neither Disney or Pixer, but awesome. The good thing is the others as well getting there with par. It got nominated for the Golden Globe, but missed out the Oscars. A film for all ages. The musical is very common in animation, especially from Disney. This was a little different, a music genre. And the characters are the very special to this film to clinch the success.

It could have been easily added to 'Zootopia' universe, since the two films are from different productions, that idea was ruled out. The selection of voice-over cast was excellent, particularly in the singing perspective. Recently Dwayne Johnson sang one for 'Moana'. I know the real life actors brought in for the marketing purpose, but anyway they all were so good.

I liked a couple of tracks, but most of them are not original. Even the theme song from 'Zootopia' by Shakira had a small part in it. So this film is surely suggestible for anyone to try at any time in any mood. It only cheers, definitely worth spending time for it. Now bring it on a sequel. As per the latest news, they have announced which is going to hit the screen in 2020. That looks too long, I need it even before that. Meanwhile, you guys enjoy it if you'ven't watched it yet.

What seems to be more important in delivering an animation movie nowadays? The Disney brand? Big eyed animals or girls covered in digital makeup? The plot twist? Well, that's a great recipe... to build empty movies.
Sing delivers an important element of storytelling almost every contemporary movie is forgetting: The story and character building.
For those who watch more than 10-15 seconds of the animation knows this: The story is about a dream. About a individual who never gives up on its dreams, and get to change the life of the ones who are alongside with it. The song they sing at the end of the movie has something to do with every character.
""American Idol""? Did the reviewers REALLY watch the movie to the end? The ""singing competition"" NEVER happens at the movie! People are really missing the point about this movie!
The animation is really enjoyable to watch.
Voice casting is just right.
The character construction is fairy tale level.
Verdict: 10/10. Don't watch it if you expect a glittering superficial movie with no real meaning to be."

Animated movies will always have a soft spot in my heart. They warm my soul, make me feel like a child again, and usually always tug at my heartstrings. This movie combined humor, music, and love. Not a love story kind of love, but a deeper kind of love. It was smart, and it was smacked with stars–literally and figuratively.

Everyone loves an underdog. If you say you don’t, you’re lying. Matthew McConaughey voices Buster Moon, a passionate koala theater owner struggling to make ends meet. He hasn’t had a successful show in years, he can’t pay his employees, and the bank won’t stop calling. In a moment of desperation, he decides to plan one last show, one that he thinks will save his theater and the Moon family name. A singing competition. He rounds up the last of his money as a cash reward and has his assistant, Ms. Crawl, to print out flyers for the event on the last bit of paper they have in the office. Ms. Crawl is a lizard with one eye, who seems to always be losing her fake glass eye, and while typing up the flyers for the event, she makes a grave mistake. What was supposed to read as a $1000 prize accidentally gets printed as a $100,000 prize.

In the meantime, we have also met the rest of the main cast. They are collectively a group of talented singers, struggling living a normal everyday life all with the same passion: singing. We meet Rosita, voiced by Reese Witherspoon, a stay at home mother of 25 piglets. She longs for a life outside of staying at home all day, and her husband barely seems to notice her anymore. Ash, Scarlett Johansson, is a porcupine in a two person band with her egocentric boyfriend who tells her constantly that she isn’t good enough to be heard. Meena, a shy elephant with a voice that will knock your socks off, being voiced by Tori Kelly what more could you expect? Mike is a little mouse with a big ego. He sings on the streets and has dreams to live a lavish lifestyle, Seth MacFarlane couldn’t have been a better choice for this character. And finally, quite possibly my favorite character of the movie, a gorilla named Johnny, voiced by Taron Egerton. Johnny’s family is involved in a shady gang, and Johnny wants out. He’s too sweet for the lifestyle and just wants to do what he loves most–sing. But he won’t do anything to disappoint his father.

They all enter the singing competition. There is a lot of different talent in the competition, as you see on actual singing competitions on television. Buster picks his favorites and the competition begins. Of course, then he learns of the mistake on the flyer, and now has to come up with $99,000 for the prize money. Now, without giving away any major spoilers for the movie, that is all I can really report on, but it is worth the money to take your kids! They’ll love it and so will you.

This movie is truly enjoyable for people of all ages. It has enough depth that parents or older siblings, or just adults like me who love children’s movies as well, can watch and not be bored. The kids will love the different animal characters, and they’ll love the humor. It’s cute and fun, and it will make you laugh. There will be moments you feel sad. It teaches valuable life lessons for people of all ages. And the ending is perfect. No story line is left with a loose end."

It's story, following a koala bear trying to save his failing theater with a singing competition, is a wonderful film to keep everyone enjoyed. The characters are very interesting, especially Johnny the Gorilla, and the music numbers make the film even more fun. Surprisingly though, the film didn't quite live up to the mark in terms of story arc for its numerous characters or even in the humor department. Yes there were a number of funny parts, but after productions like Despicable Me and Minions, I had expected a little more amusment.

In 2007, Christopher ""Chris"" Meledandri, the founder and current CEO of Illumination Entertainment, founds his own animation film production company after having been President of 20th Century Fox Animation and supervised and produced movies such as ""Ice Age"", its sequel ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"", among others. Three years later, ""Despicable Me"" seeps in worldwide movie show-times as a joyful, energetic and mostly invigorating feature film. Since then, the company has been rising, collecting recognition and purification which are credited to its works. With discrepant spin-offs, sequels, and original ideas, they've been working on providing an annual film, and while 2011 didn't release any new project, they challenge themselves this year like the major studios with two films filled with magic, spirit, and exultation. After ""The Secret Life of Pets"" of Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney, arrives the seventh one and the first animated musical of the Universal Pictures section. The factory shows clearly conviction deposited in its product, since it has been a pretty competitive year in the matter, and even story lines of this film have been outlined in other projects, putting it at great risk around to the unpleasant and subjective paradigms. However, there are inexplicably films of which you cannot hate, even though you know that something goes wrong, well this is the case.

In a universe where humans are substituted by animals, it's ordinary to glimpse a giraffe jogging, a lizard talking or a zebra cooking. In this domesticated world is set Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey), a koala owner of a fluctuating theater which is falling apart due to the almost non-existent income. He hopes to become a virtuoso host and rebuilds the theater, which his father bequeathed him; so announces a singing competition without restrictions or impediments, anyone who considers that can hum has the possibility of auditing in the proscenium. After a grueling knockout round, there are five shortlisted contenders to fight for the tempting award, a prize that has been altered by mistake. The finalists are intended to be a heterogeneous group: Rita (Reese Witherspoon), a housewife and mother of 25 piglets should be related a lover pop culture pig, Gunter (Nick Kroll); an egotistical and individualistic small mouse, Mike (Seth Macfarlane); a teenage elephant with stage panic, Meena (Tori Kelly); a young bouncer who wants categorically a different tomorrow from his family gives him, Johnny (Taron Egerton) and a rocker porcupine with an amorous deception, which impels her to emerge as a soloist; Ash (Scarlett Johansson). Around these plots, the story succumbs in well-known territories, however, it comes out unscathed thanks to the thoughtful and authentic connection with their characters; a story that finds its main propellant in the wonderful inspiration.

In times where scrupulousness for accuracy and concentration for detail ruled in ""Zootopia"" or ""Kubo and the Two Strings"", many people consider that the film does not take hold in visual terms regarding its predecessors, placing emphasis repeatedly in the facial gestures scarcity and poor worked textures, however, contrary to what many declares, I encounter this one even more effective since they put the organic aside for going deeper in significant features for development, it should be noted that the above does not mean that the movie perishes visually, it's gorgeous on the essentials; but evidently dissimilar against its competitors. It's noteworthy that Illumination has joined the trend of concealing different easter eggs among its films in order to generate a kind of not confirmed interconnection among them, clearly highlighting the masks used by gorillas in the robberies, the iconic and unforgettable face of Snowball of ""The Secret Life of Pets"".

Music is a vital issue, therefore they inject covers of 65 different artists, which ranging from Ariana Grande's low notes to the exquisite polyphony of Frank Sinatra. Katy Perry, Kanye West, Sam Smith, The Beatles, Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj lead the melodic lists artfully personified, linked and adorned by particularly humorous circumstances. In addition to this, the film also conceived two own songs: ""Faith"", performed by Stevie Wonder and Ariana Grande and ""Set it All Free"" sung by incredible Johansson.

The last card of the ascending study is an uplifting, noticeably touching and fertile in laughs reality show that will return you the hope of finding simple films with teachings so important. With animation standards of the seventh art in these days, ""Sing"" may not be an aesthetic pearl, but who longs for sensational animals and computerized voices when you have Taron Egerton singing to the dreams, to Scarlett Johansson as a mother and model or to Mathew McConaughey keeping alive the illusion of dreaming and fighting; any human being would swap one thing for other."

A lot of laugh-out-loud lines, one classic sequence (the carwash) and, surprisingly, it veres from very funny to incredibly moving. Great for kids and adults.

954,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sing/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,lrbohnert,"Dec 21, 2016",10,"In a world of anthropomorphic animals, optimistic koala Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) is the owner of a music theater, having been interested in show-business ever since his father took him to his first music show when he was a child. His assistant is a slightly senile green iguana named Ms. Karen Crawley (Garth Jennings), who has a glass eye (which pops out at times). Lately, Buster's theater is in financial trouble due to showing productions that have bombed, and his theater is in danger of closing down. Buster tells his friend, Suffolk sheep Eddie Noodleman (John C. Reilly), that he will try and save his theater from closure by hosting a singing competition, with the prize being $1000, despite having only random stuff in his briefcase.
Buster isn't the only one in a crisis, as other animals in the city have issues of their own. Rosita (Reese Witherspoon) is a talented singer, but has given up her dreams of performing to raise 25 unruly children and is constantly neglected by her workaholic husband, Norman (Nick Offerman). Meena (Tori Kelly) has a great singing voice, but has severe stage fright, causing her pushy grandfather (Jay Pharoah) to pressure her to face her fear. Mike (Seth MacFarlane) is a street musician who plays the saxophone but doesn't make easy money, prompting him to threaten people into giving him cheap profits. Johnny (Taron Egerton) is the son of mobster Big Daddy (Peter Serafinowicz) who wants him to follow in his criminal footsteps, but Johnny aspires to be a singer. Punk-rocker Ash (Scarlett Johansson) is in a band with her boyfriend Lance (Beck Bennett) who is critical of her rocking style.
While printing fliers for the competition, Ms. Crawley's glass eye causes her to accidentally print $100,000 as the prize money instead of $1,000. Before the fliers can be checked, they are accidentally blown out of Buster's office drawing lots of candidates around the city including Johnny, Meena, Ash, Rosita, and Mike. After holding auditions with a turnout greater than expected, Buster picks Mike, Johnny, Rosita, Ash, and a few others to be in the contest. Meena's stage fright causes her to bomb her audition, Lance is dismissed from the contest when he auditions with Ash, and Rosita is partnered with another pig contestant named Gunther (Nick Kroll) to be in a dancing routine. Soon enough, Buster discovers Ms. Crawley's error when Eddie shows him the flier, but instead of telling the contestants of the mistake and of the true prize of $1,000, he tries to get enough money for the promised reward.
Convinced by her grandfather, Meena tries to get Buster to give her another audition, but due to some technical difficulties, she is hired as a stage hand instead. After some of the animals quit, Rosita, Mike, Johnny, Gunther, Ash, and (eventually) Meena are the only ones left in the show. However, their individual problems begin to hinder rehearsals, such as Rosita floundering in her dance routine with the glory hog Gunther, Ash suffering from immense heartbreak when she thinks Lance cheated, Johnny inadvertently letting his dad be arrested during a heist in the shipping lanes, Meena's stage fright, and Mike owing money to a mob of bears when he cheats in a card game. Buster visits Eddie to convince him to get his grandmother Nana Noodleman (Jennifer Saunders) to host the reward money for the show. When they visit Nana, she accepts their offer, but in a snobbish manner. On the day Nana Noodleman comes, the bear mob who Mike earns the ire from come and demand the money from Buster, but his suitcase is full of junk, leading the others to turn on Buster for his deception. Before Buster can face anyone's wrath, a glass tank full of luminescent squids **** and floods the theater, evicting everyone from it. After Nana leaves in a huff, the theater literally comes crashing down.
Homeless and crestfallen, Buster takes up residence at Eddie's house. News of what transpired at the theater hits the airwaves and Buster is ridiculed, further diminishing his confidence. The contestants visit him and try to cheer him up, but Buster is too despondent to listen to them, so they leave. Buster tries to earn his keep by opening a car wash, using the same bucket that his dad used to pay for Buster's theater. Eddie, unwilling to see Buster so miserable, reminds him of what Buster had told him before: ""Once you hit rock bottom, there's nowhere else to go but up.""
After hearing Meena sing in the remains of the theater, Buster's confidence is renewed and he reinstates the show, leading everyone (including Rosita and Meena's families) to come. Mike bails out when he learns that the prize money is omitted, but soon returns to show his stuff."
955,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sing/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,ceb1031,"Dec 21, 2016",10,"It’s been said that the most powerful story is one that can be distilled to a single, simple, easy to understand idea. The more complex the idea the harder it is for emotional content to be connected to (or absorbed from) it. It certainly makes sense from a marketing perspective if not necessarily an artistic one; easily understood is easily sold.
From that point of view, Sing makes perfect sense. Animate some current pop songs with anthropomorphic animals to add in some fun animation antics and sit back. It’s a similar idea to the one behind stuff like Glee and Pitch Perfect but with more dancing pigs. It doesn’t really make sense in any other way, but that’s not particularly a deal breaker.
The big driver is diminutive showman Buster Moon (McConaughey), the world’s best worst theater producer. In love with musical theater since he was a child, Moon has been trying to make a go with his own theater for years but has come up with nothing but disappointment. On his last leg and with the bank threatening foreclosure, Moon has one last brainstorm – a singing competition that will both discover new talent and get the city invested in seeing one of their own make it to the big time.
When a type-o in his competition flyer brings singers out of the woodwork, Buster is beset with more talent than he knows what to do with, including overworked housewife Rosita (Witherspoon), gangster-in-training Johnny (Egerton), brash lounge singer Mike (MacFarlane), wannabe punk rocker Ash (Johansson), and shy shower singer Meena (Kelly). But it will all be for naught if he can’t get them to gel as an act or get anyone to come and watch, something he’s never particularly excelled at.
Simple ideas can have entertainment value and for all its lack of an animating idea (no pun intended), and when Sing does what it sets out to do, it’s a solid time. It basically has two things to offer and not much else. The first is well-cast and directed voice work, primarily McConaughey. Buster is an irrepressible spirit, endlessly optimistic no matter what obstacles are thrust in his path.
McConaughey imbues him with a can-do spirit and joy to be doing what he loves that his perseverance despite his failure is both funny and believable. He also eats up most of the screen time as his co-stars are constantly balanced against each other in order to keep their own stories understandable (if not developed) and reflect more light on Buster. And sing their songs really well, which they do. Egerton is a particular find and could easily have a career as a pop star if he decided to give up the whole acting thing.
Beyond existing to have a place for the voice acting to emanate from the characters, Sing doesn’t have a lot to offer. They are necessary evils for source music delivery and so that producers Illumination (Despicable Me) can practice the imaginative gag construction they’ve become so good at. From Buddy’s desperate attempts to fix his ailing theater to a very personal car wash, Sing’s sight gags are where it’s real innovation can be found."

This biopic dramatizes her marriage and early career up to the landmark case that solidified her crusade as an equal rights activist. Even though Felicity Jones does a decent job of bringing out the character's strengths and doubts, the whole thing feels a bit like a Lifetime flick. The relationship with her husband (Armie Hammer) is sweetly romantic and the repetitive discrimination borders on message movie. The story plays out interestingly enough, but as the crucial trail gets closer, the movie's momentum bogs down with legal wrangling. Even so, it's an interesting and a well-made ode to Ginsburg's intellect and influence."

Although her accent failed her at times, Felicity Jones always commanded the audience’s attention and she was ably supported by a very fine cast, although I, for one, found Armie Hammer’s height distracting.

Directed by Mimi Leder with a screenplay written by Justice Ginsburg’s  nephew,

Daniel Stiepelman, the film portrays this dynamic lady as a

Aptly portrayed by Felicity Jones in the leading role, Ms. Jones  is supported by by Armie Hammer, Sam Waterston and Justin Theroux. Having attended the same law school when Justice Ginsburg studied there, I can personally attest to the very few female law students in attendance  and how extraordinary they had to be in order to gain admission to this restricted legal club .Clearly, Justice Ginsburg is the embodiment of the best of the best of all of them.

With fine, underrated performances by Felicity Jones and Kathy Bates, the film capably walks viewers through the complexities of the legal landscape without resorting to excessive legalese while simultaneously putting a human face on the central issues in question, both in the lives of the protagonist and those for whom she served as advocate. To be sure, the pacing sometimes gets bogged down, and the screenplay tends to unfold in a safe, tried-and-true, somewhat predictable manner.

Until one night, when their adult children come into conflict. One commits a murder, the other is a witness, and when one of them ends up dead, the family is torn apart with one on the run and the other on his heels. It honestly took me a while to watch this movie, because I was tired of Liam Neeson and his very particular set of skills, but his character wasn't what I expected. While not having the popularity of Taken, Neeson's performance in this film, was better than any performance he's given in an action film to date. Paired with the ultimate crime boss, Ed Harris, and The Killing's Joel Kinnaman, this movie had a cast that couldn't fail. Watching this compelling story, I couldn't help but think that this would have been an amazing ending for the Sopranos. Run All Night was surprising in the way that it was done, because it wasn't your typical mafia movie, but it wasn't an action film either. The writers very cleverly combined elements of both to combine the thrilling action of a Falling Down, with the crime story of a really good Sopranos episode. The film wasn't just about the incident and the chase and that's why it was special. They even managed to get Law & Order's Vincent D'Onofrio to play the lead detective in the case, and we all know the intensity he can bring to a role. It was a slow start and a somewhat predictable ending, but in the middle, Run All Night was so good, that I could have stayed up and kept watching it all night."

Pretty entertaining action flick with a fast paced narration. A typical Liam Neeson's movie. Take a gun and go hunt down the bad guys or protect loved ones from them kind of movie. Under his league, like always he was awesome. This has been a already heard story, like a trivia say. Yes, it was similar to 'Road to Perdition', but happens for a different reason and with the different cast. Still the movie was better that I expected.

I went speechless when I saw Neeson was begging in the opening scene. Because that's not his style, action heroes like him, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis et cetera, they don't fit in those roles. But what came just a few minutes later was like switching to second, third, fourth and fifth gear in a quick session. You know you can't judge a book by its cover, same applies for this as well. The film was good, I mean better than average, better than ratings and reviews across the web.

It was kind of unofficial 'A Man with a Gun' trilogy (I made it up) after 'Unknown' and 'Non-stop'. Because if you check it out all these three film's posters, Neeson will be seen with a gun in the similar fashion. Hope this director and actor comes together to do more movies in the future, since it is a rocking combo. Well, they all might not be the masterpieces, but enjoyable at the time of the watch. Especially it will not disappoint Neeson's fans.

There's a lot going on the plot. Plenty of dialog fleshes out the dark and solemn story, characters, and world. It doesn't skip out on the drama. The movie gives Neeson a chance to flex his acting muscles just as much as his action scene ones.

As far as the action scenes go they are quite tense. Brutal shootouts, a fast car chase, and some hand-to-hand combat all are made to feel fresh thanks to the occasional awesome camera angle. Serra shoots scenes in cool ways here. It helps the action which could have felt overly familiar feel fresh instead.

The entire cast gives fantastic performances. There are quite a few characters here acting from different roles that tie together into one cohesive whole. Usually in Neeson movies it's just him stealing the show. Here though there are other actors to keep your attention. Including particularly cool villains in Ed Harris and rapper ""Common"" (Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr.).

It's a particularly grim action-thriller. Part Taken and part A Walk Among the Tombstones with it's own cool ideas thrown in. The results are one of the more exciting action-thrillers to come out in quite a while. It's a wild ride all the way through that doesn't sacrifice any aspect of it's storytelling. It' a dynamite thriller and one of the best films of 2015.

981,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/run-all-night/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MattBrady99,"Apr 30, 2015",7,"Yes I know this review is late but March has been a slow month for me with movies not playing at my location theater, it's a pain in the ass sometimes but hey I finally got a chance to watch it and this is what I have to say about.

The story to Run All Night is about a prolific and aging hitman, Jimmy Conlon, once known as The Gravedigger, has fallen on hard times. With the sins of his past catching up, he finds out his estranged son has been targeted by his former mob boss and must now choose between the crime family he grew up with or the family he left behind.

I think I was like everybody else when I sawed the trailer to Run All Night thinking it was another copy cat of Taken with Liam Neeson playing the same character. With all these movie with Liam Neeson playing pretty much the same character in every movie his in is getting a bit old now and his movies now I would call them The Liam Neeson film with action and bullets flying everywhere. Now I don't hate Liam Neeson I actually freaking love the guy he's awesome and his really funny when his mad.

After the long search for this movie and finally viewing it I was actually surprise that this wasn't another Taken movie and more of a movie that can stand on it's own feet as a revenge thriller with a lot of good things in it.

Liam Nesson in this movie isn't just playing himself this time, he's actually got a character ark in this movie and his character isn't all perfect but more damage and understandable. Liam Nesson did a great performance showing all the pain and sadness from his character and Liam nailed it because well this shows you that Liam **** a great actor. Liam Nesson character is the kind of character that I think we all can relate to when he isn't perfect but he's trying his hardest to make things right but it doesn't quite work out, we had that in are life's and it may not happened to you yet but it will do sooner or late, and as I said before Liam pulled it off excellently.

Ed Harris was also great in this movie as he added a lot to his character just like Nesson. I think Liam Nesson and Ed Harris back and forward with each other and how both of them stare each other down, **** talking to each other and ready to attack and the movie took a whole scene to show that and it was like art house brilliant for two characters who are both damage to bounce off each other with their emotions really made one heck of a show.

The directing of the movie I thought did a great job directing characters and actions scenes. The writing in the movie that can be cliche at times but still has some bad-ass lines that will crack a smile on your face or leave you in silence.

The title of the movie doesn't lie at all, the movie is literally set on one night and everyone is always moving around and nobody get's a break everything's always moving. This is what action movie plot should be like and Run All Night gives you that plot that isn't stupid but more creative for what they had.

Now for problems I do have some like: There are so many things going on in this movie with the cops, mob bosses, drug dealers, Ed Harris, Liam Nesson mid life crisis and may god these so many things happening and it feels a bit crushed together at time for how many things they wanted to show.

But overall I had a good time watching Run All Night and I was surprise how it didn't turn into the cliche Liam Nesson action movie that's trying way to hard to be Taken. The movie actually had character ark, a good story to it and a solid cast and actors that pulled **** performance in this surprisingly good movie."

Unlike the 'Taken' trilogy, where Neeson actually carried the whole movie himself, here we have the excellent Ed Harris, whose character takes a big chunk of the weight off of Neeson, although he is still the main focus of the movie.

With a touch of aesthetically crafted details and scenes, 'Run All Night' offers both drama and action, a touching and thrilling story with classical action film elements. Although the latter causes a visible lack of originality plot-wise and a series of (stereo)typical elements, the former is so powerfully crafted that you're actually able to disregard the majority of those elements.

Certainly, although you'll be able to predict the ending quite early on, 'Run All Night' is a movie worth watching, because of Neeson and Harris, if nothing else. Cheers!"

The latest Keanu Reeves movie John Wick, which just came out a few months ago, had the exact same plot.  It was also somewhat annoying that at the beginning of this film Liam Neeson plays a washed up, drunken ex-hit man who can barely function, yet when the action starts he suddenly transforms into a sober fighting machine that can beat up anyone.  It also has the obligatory over the top ridiculous car chase that is now standard fair in any movie of this type.  That said, when the action started, I was on the edge of my seat.

After just only 2 months here we go again with a new Liam Neeson movie ""Run All Night "" which makes me feels like i don't know what to expected from this movie since like i said before Taken 3 is terrible and the movie trailer feels boring and repetitive.

But after i saw this movie i really think there's still hope in Liam Neeson movie with Run All Night being this good.

The most surprising thing in this movie for me is the script is actually really good Brad Inglesby used the relationship between father and son in the movie and tie it to the main conflict of the movie really well.

Also the 2 main characters which is Liam Neeson and Ed Harris characters are so good that just make watching them try to kill / revenge each other fun to watch.

The Director Jaume Collet-Serra is pretty good in this movie too , with his fun and exciting storytelling , although i wish he use the ""Survive in One Night"" theme more because right now i just don't feel like the movie have to use that theme at all.

Overall Run All Night is a good action movie with good action scene , great characters and the movie always know what it want to tell , which is how much father love their son , even their son is totally a terrible person they still love them and will do anything to help them."

I'm a ""good guys must always win"" type and don't like seeing good guys die indiscriminately, even if lots of bad guys die too unless it means something.

The movie has a fairly strong cast composed of Neeson, Ed Harris, Joel Kinnaman and several other strong actors in the supporting cast like Vincent D'Onofrio and Common. Run All Night is a action film that is as classic as they come. Neeson is a character you generally care about and he is vulnerable at points in the movie where in the last installments in the Taken series it seemed as if he was invincible. Ed Harris also has a strong performance in the film and its nice to see him as the evil one as it seems like he is normally a good guy in most cases. However, one of may problems with the film is that there are two many important players in the film. You get the  Mafia, the police, and an assassin all at once and although that's pretty cool there are points where it seems like it too much.

No (3) sub-plots, 18 different people/names to remember or not being able to understand every 3rd word of the dialog. I could have gone the next day and sat thru the entire movie again and enjoy it as if I first seen it. A mob type movie that would have made the Mafia proud. Neeson said once in an interview that he is getting to old to be on the screen as a tough guy beating the hell out of two people at the same time. He may be in his sixties but it sure doesn't show on the screen. He pulls off the tough guy effortlessly. If you enjoyed the ""Taken"" series you'll walk away from RAN completely satisfied.

998,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/run-all-night/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,quincytheodore,"Mar 13, 2015",7,"This may look like just another Liam Neeson's flick after Taken, understandably so with his usual look and its revenge premise, but worry not, Run All Night has enough substantial material and gritty crime ambiance to entertain. In a more convincing noir set-up, the movie gives Liam Neeson more range on his character, while still keeping his more well-known persona of action star. It justifiably takes more time to establish the premise to ensure this is more than just a random shooting spree.

Jimmy Conlon (Liam Nesson) has been an enforcer for mob boss Shawn Maquire (Ed Harris) for decades. He has done many terrible things, but when his son Michael (Joel Kinnaman) is unfortunately embroiled in the mafia's shady dealings, Jimmy must decide where his loyalty lies. This concept of veteran gunslinger who must fight once more is admittedly used by the recent Equalizer and John Wick, however Run All Night opts for more family issue than flair to create a different yet equally engaging effect.

Acting is pretty well done, action fans must be familiar with Neeson's performance by now. Ed Harris and Joel Kinnaman provide what was missing from Taken series, this is not your average rescue operation. It's a perspective of camaraderie relationship, a strange brother-in-arms dilemma Neeson's character had to deal with both his longtime friend and also his son. Harris is charismatic as always, while Kinnaman from Robocop and The Killing TV series, is splendid as the young son. He looks rugged, but still act upstanding enough for a contrast on the mob life.

The dynamic works in crime or gangster thriller. It also boasts gray visual, akin to 90s mystery movie. This near exclusive darkness is a bit daunting since it may hamper the fast paced action, but it does create the authentic feel of the city and its underlying often neglected lifestyles. The movie knows exactly what it wants to accomplish with its theme and confidently portrays it with the gritty visual.

Pacing is mostly good, although it staggers a bit in midway point. A few scenes feel as though they are a bit glossed over, probably for the sake of pushing the tempo towards the latter halt, these sequences could be explored more. Action is plausible, each fired shot, especially the one that hits, carries more weight. This is not Liam Neeson going Rambo all night, but a meticulous firework show.

Run All Night makes good use of the actors' charisma and the sordid gangster tone in creating a fray from dusk till dawn."

In fact, BJB felt very relevant and up-to-date both in 2016 and in todays world. The story may seem a little unrealistic - two potential fathers who both fight to stay in Bridget and baby’s life - but this does provide the heart of the film and it is a storyline which is 100% worthy for a Bridget Jones movie. 
The script, much like the first film, is witty, engaging and so, so funny. BJB leaves you feeling warm inside while also laughing so hard you may feel something warm running down your leg (🫣). Much different than the first two films, this rom-com revolves around a trio of middle-aged actors and it is all the better for it! Not only does it give a sense of nostalgia, but it gave the franchise a great boost having an instalment set in the 2010’s. I, for one, was able to catch my first Bridget film in the cinema which was a truly special moment for me. I’m sure this was the same for others. 
Emma Thompson is a welcome, and very comical, addition to the ever-growing supporting cast. She stole the show in every single scene she had. I loved her character! As always, Renée Zellweger is outstanding, I literally have no notes because she is perfect as Bridget. The only thing I will note is that, obviously, Hugh Grant did not return for this film and his departure is felt! Bridget with Mark vs Bridget with Daniel worked so well because there was evident chemistry between both pairs. Newcomer Patrick Dempsey did struggle in this area. Thier chemistry was nowhere near the level shared between Zellweger and Colin Firth."

Its funny in an awkward/cringe-y way at times, as ever. Its not a film to be taken too seriously or anything, of course. This film features a decent cast - Colin Firth, Jm Broadbent, Sally Phillips, Joanna Scanlan and Renee Zellweger as the titular character and Patrick Dempsey as Bridgets new 'man on the scene'. There's even a cameo by Ed Sheeran. Its not especially memorable but its a nice enough watch regardless - a good bit of fun which I'd recommend."

But who, her old boss (who has died, maybe?, next movie) her childhood friend, a new American?  Fine actors all, the story line is a bit pretentious, but you knew that already.  Can I say, what happened to Renee?  She looks so different, maybe older, did she have surgery?  I think it's her cheeks; her face looks thinner except when she smiles, the cheeks puff out and she looks like the old Renee we all know and love."
1004,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/bridget-joness-baby/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"Dec 24, 2016",7,"This is a two-man job!

Unlike the first two films, this was not based on the book. Instead, it is an original screenplay that fills the gap between the second and the third book. So reading the third book before watching this film is a spoiler. Most importantly the fourth film is on, only officially have to be announced.

The original director returned to this, but I appreciate the story and the screenplay and people behind it. I did not think this sequel would work, but it exceeded my expectation. A simple story and very familiar settings, but developed so well. There's no Bridget's diary in this, instead an iPad.

Renee Zellweger was totally unrecognisable. Actually, I said that in my 'The Whole Truth' review. But she was good to return as Bridget. Colin Firth looks too older than his actual age, but was great in his part. No Hugh Grant, but a new competitor was introduced which is none other than Patrick Dempsey.

This is not the same kind of narration that we saw a decade ago. Because all the characters are aged, so according to the situation this story takes place. It's a two hour long film, but it had some good jokes. Those who enjoyed the first two would surely enjoy it as well. So choosing it to watch is not a bad idea.

1005,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/bridget-joness-baby/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,madmovieman,"Nov 29, 2016",7,"There are few films that irritate me more than the original Bridget Jones’ Diary, and its sequel. Annoying, cheesy and dumb, I never found much enjoyment in them at all, which is the main reason why I was so surprised to like Bridget Jones’ Baby so much. Finally giving the character a likable and interesting persona, whilst also delivering comedy and romance in a confident and fresh way, fortunately moving away from the repetitive first two films, this is by far the best film of the whole series.

To start off, I think the most important reason this film is so enjoyable is because it’s totally different to the first two films. As much as I didn’t like them, I recognise a large audience did. However, 13 years later, it would have been insane to churn out the same formula once again, but I was delighted to see that director Sharon Maguire and writer Helen Fielding managed to provide a different experience.

With Bridget’s now more ‘mature’ and confident persona, this film doesn’t try to be another Pride And Prejudice parody full of awkward slips and mishaps. Yes, there are still a good few clumsy moments, but that’s a part of Bridget’s nature that even I wouldn’t want to see disappear completely, but what this film does so well is manage the balance between idiotic comedy and a genuinely engaging story, making for a far more entertaining watch that allows you to both laugh and get engrossed in Bridget’s various adventures.

One more positive that comes from the story here is that it’s not as insanely focused on Bridget Jones alone. Whilst she’s of course still the main character, a lot of this film is actually dedicated to the characters played by Patrick Dempsey and Colin Firth, both of whom provide excellent comic relief, a different dynamic to Hugh Grant’s bad-boy vibe from the first two films, and an occasional welcome break from Bridget’s inner monologue, which is yet another point that makes this film not only more bearable than the first two, but far more well-rounded and genuinely interesting.

Finally, we can’t ignore Renée Zellweger’s performance here. Along with her character’s maturing, Zellweger gives a far more likable and reasonable performance, making Bridget so much more tolerable than before. Although she was never a huge issue in the first two films, seeing Bridget actually act like an adult throughout, rather than a third edition **** 12 year old girl, was very refreshing, and definitely made her character a lot more accessible and interesting for me.

Overall, I was really surprised by Bridget Jones’ Baby. It’s not only a funnier and more enjoyable watch than its two predecessors, but a welcome evolution for the series, taking Bridget’s ridiculous mishaps down a notch by providing more interesting storytelling, characters and romance, whilst also featuring some of the best acting and directing of the trilogy."

1017,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/elvis-nixon/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,FilipeNeto,"Jan 15, 2021",9,"This was one of the films I saw at the last New Year's Eve, and it was a pleasant surprise, considering that I was not particularly impressed with the synopsis I had read about it. The strong point of the film is the simple fact that it is based, obviously in a very distorted way, on a meeting that really took place between Elvis Presley, one of the most notable music artists ever, and the American President Richard Nixon, remembered by American history for the worst reasons, usually, given that he was one of the few presidents to step down to avoid being forced out from office.

The script is good, and adapts perfectly to a short film like this. In fact, almost everything happens only during one day of the singer's life, who, distressed by drug abuse by young people, decides to collaborate with the authorities as a plain clothed federal agent, secretly, in order to combat the abuses of youth who, for him, corrupted America. Nixon is not a kind of man who adheres to fashions or wants to be with singers, and will naturally pose several objections to the meeting, but he will be overcome by his daughter, who is an Elvis fan.

The cast is as small as the film, but it has a great performance by Kevin Spacey, an actor that I usually don't usually appreciate very much but who did an excellent job as the president. Michael Shannon is an actor I didn't know, I don't remember any of his films, but I think he did an interesting job in the role of Elvis, although I have my doubts about how strict he was in the way he portrayed the King. Obviously, the scenes with the White House advisers stank of comic satire and I don't believe they happened that way. Alex Pettyfer, Colin Hanks and Evan Peters play the secondary roles with dignity and commitment, the latter two with a strong comic streak.

Technically, it is a pleasant film, which entertains and flows smoothly until the end, with good doses of humor and very inspired and colorful dialogues. It has a pleasant cinematography and the costumes make good use of the clothes and fashion of that time. The sets, in turn, are not so visibly dated, but they fit perfectly. The soundtrack is very good and uses iconic songs like ""Hold On, I'm Comming"" by Sam and Dave, or ""Suzy Q"", by Creedence Clearwater Revival, functioning as a true potpourri of the best music of the early Seventies."

Der Superstar schreibt einen Brief an den amtierenden US-Präsidenten ­– mit der blauäugigen Bitte, als Undercoveragent für Recht und Ordnung zu sorgen. Ein Treffen findet tatsächlich statt, das daraus resultierende Foto geht in die Geschichte ein. Um viel mehr geht es nicht in Liza Johnsons Film, kein politischer Ballast drückt die Stimmung der seichten, dafür doppelt charmanten Komödie. Das ist aber auch nicht schlimm – denn Kevin Spacey als grummeliger Nixon ist zum Schießen, Michael Shannon gibt souverän den leicht melancholischen King. Elvis & Nixon zeigt die wohl populärsten Personen seiner Zeit somit als Alltagsmenschen – wodurch der Film dann doch unerwartetes Terrain erschließt."

1020,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/elvis-nixon/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Spangle,"Nov 6, 2016",7,"Elvis & Nixon may not be the most challenging piece of cinema ever released, but it is a very one. With two terrific lead actors in Michael Shannon and Kevin Spacey, Elvis & Nixon is based on a single image of Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon in the White House. The rest rises out of an imagined reason for the meeting. In doing so, the film manages to delve into both Elvis and Nixon as people, serving as an interesting look at both of them, even if the story itself is not really true. However, what it lacks in truth, it makes up for with comedy. A smart and witty film, Elvis & Nixon is incredibly well-written as a comedy with lots of little references to real events and outright jokes. The end result of all of this is truly enjoyable hour and a half.

As Elvis, Michael Shannon is loud, boisterous, and magnanimous. However, he does not shy away from the internal struggles facing Elvis and the status of being a celebrity. Though far from unique in this, the film does a good job to evoke feelings of sympathy for ""The King"". Remaining deified to this very day, he is rarely looked at as a person and the film does a good job to make us feel for him on a personal level. He is not just some kooky rock star who wants to be a federal agent, he is a real person and nobody ever gives him that time of day. Shannon's performance is truly magnetic and really carries the film on his shoulders.

As Nixon, Kevin Spacey is equally terrific. Though a lot of it is reminiscent of Frank Underwood in House of Cards, his Nixon feels quite accurate and stoic. Watching his transformation from when he is first told about Elvis wanting to meet him to when he actually meets him is quite comical. Yet, Spacey makes it feel authentic and really captures that ""not cool but want to be cool"" essence that many people have, especially when in the presence of somebody cool. Spacey's turn here also provides many laughs, especially at the end when he is twirling the gun. There is a certain simplicity to the style of comedy in the film and Nixon captures most of the best lines in this one, with Spacey making the most of it with good delivery and timing.

However, in saying this, while the film is quite funny and a good look at both of its real life protagonists, Elvis & Nixon is an incredibly slight film. Coming in at just an hour and a half, Elvis & Nixon is largely just focused on this meeting and setting it up, while pretending to develop of a background relationship/issue for Jerry Schilling (Alex Pettyfer), who is an associate and friend of Elvis. It can certainly drag as you just want them to get to the meeting. The romance background, which is barely looked at, is clearly there to just add some further dimension to the film, but even with that here, Elvis & Nixon rarely makes the case for being a feature-length film. While I did really enjoy my time with it, it probably would have been even better as a short film (40-50 minutes in length maybe), allowing it to be more focused on the photograph and meeting, rather than adding fluff to make it longer.

As a whole, Elvis & Nixon is a very funny film that may be a little too long for its story, but thanks to Shannon's Presley and Spacey's Nixon, the film is incredibly easy to watch."

Shannon portrays The King as a sincere, misunderstood and misguided character, while it's Spacey who gets to satirize the President with hilarious results.

Literal jumpy knee jerk fear, bellowing frequent laughter and frog in my throat choked up foggy eyed and flowing tears. That doesn't happen too often within one movie much less as well as this one pulled off. Exceptionally well done coming from someone accustomed to consuming horror/crime entertainment and anything innovative and new in comedy... and who generally scoffs or passes at most ""tear jerker"" types of film because of how rarely the show/movie delivers on the genre it fell into.

It didn’t try to change the formula of the story completely away from the franchise’s purpose like Cars 2. It didn’t try to add a pointless “leaving for the race” segment like in Cars. But it did make the filler even more pointless with the training montage and Thunder Hollows. But it did put more spice into the story, with many unexpected routes the action takes. Still better than Cars 1 and would watch again if I had the chance."

On one hand, I realize there's not really much wrong with the movie and it's completely fine.  On the other, it's extremely forgettable and boring.  PIXAR made three movies in a row (The Good Dinosaur, Finding Dory, and Cars 3) where I hardly remember anything from them and are not as fun as the rest of PIXAR's catalog.  They're not necessarily the worst movies or even bad movies but they aren't all that much fun.  This movie is just like the previous two.  Unfunny, uninteresting, and forgettable.  Cars 3 stars Lightning McQueen instead of Mater (like in Cars 2) which was a good sign.  This movie feels a lot more like the first Cars which was also a step in the right direction.  I really like the opening, and the ending is bittersweet.  Everything else in between is really hard to watch because I had no interest whatsoever in what was happening.  This movie is very bland, but it's not all that bad either.  It is very conflicting.  I like the first Cars more, and it's definitely not as bad as Cars 2."

Cars 3 is probably the most controversial Pixar film, because it belongs to a mixed franchise.  But surprisingly, Cars 3 is the best of the series easily.  Cars 3 has more in its mind than Lightning McQueen simply winning a race, but also trying to prove himself worthy to stay in the sport he loves, then becoming a mentor to Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonza) later.  The story is great, so are the characters.  Cruz is a nice addition to the trilogy; there are also a lot more new characters like Sterling (Lightings new sponsor voiced by Nathan Fillion), Jackson Storm (An unexplained protagonist trying to throw Lightning of his game voiced by Armie Hammer), Smokey (Doc Hudson's old crew chief, who later becomes Lightnings Crew Chief voiced by Chris Cooper), and a lot of other old racers.  Almost everything in this movie is great, Cars 3 has great race scenes, outstanding animation, a great story, amazing movie trailers, and a fabulous musical score (composed by Randy Newman).  Although the story is predictable, Cars 3 is a great closure to a very lopsided trilogy, it's the Cars 2 we asked for, and it's great because it pays a huge respect to Paul Newman and the original Cars Movie.
Rating: B+"
1080,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars-3/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,FreedomFighters,"Feb 11, 2018",9,"After ""Cars 2"" was much weaker than the first film, so much so that it was Pixar's first rotten-rated film on Rotten Tomatoes (even though I still enjoyed it), many of us scratched our heads and wondered why Pixar was going to make a third film. Oddly enough, though, I actually find it to be my favorite of the ""Cars"" films. Beyond the typically beautiful animation, I appreciate that Pixar actually took the series back to the racetrack, focused on Lightning more, and made the film a bit more mature, kept the film from feeling like too much of a retread, and actually adding some legitimately emotional and tense moments in the film. Is it one of Pixar's best? No, definitely not. Is it still an enjoyable film? I think so! And even if you aren't too interested in the series, it's worth checking out to see what side of the fence you sit on here."

Having seen enough animated feature that possible eligible for the 2018 Oscars, I'm really disappointed with the result of some of the big titles. Yes, including this one, not big films, except 'Coco' are up to any impressive. The bright side is, after a long time, 2D animation might win. This was an okay film. Though I liked the story outline, but did not like how it all was narrated.

I have seen the evolution of 'Harry Potter'. I meant the cast, particularly the main three. For a decade, the little kids grew into older teenagers. But for an animation character, there's no concept of ageing. They always remain same. This film just gave a new perspective. I mean it talked about being or growing old and how it impacts our lives. That we can't hold forever our safe position. Sooner or later, the youngsters will take over it.

McQueen is enjoying his racing, competing with his friendly opponents. But it all changes when a young rookie rewrites the history. Without able to cope with the new generation and their aggression, how McQueen and Co like to counter the latest threat is the film's story. Liked such inspiring storyline. I mean it would inspire more the middle aged people than anybody else. But it is a fun film for all ages, particularly the kids. It is just like turning 'Rambo' into 'Creed', I just want a new beginning in the next sequel.

It isn't as good as the first film, however.  Thankfully we do get to see Radiator Springs again, if briefly.  The movie doesn't have a true Villain, just a snotty newcomer who we only see during the races.  Speaking of the races, they are thankfully short and not drawn out.  The movie is mainly about Lightning McQueen facing retirement and passing the baton to another racer.  It is also refreshing to see an animated film that is geared towards boys.  75% of animated films are made for little girls these days.  Not to say that both genders won't enjoy it, just relieved it's not another Princess movie."

Sex and the City... both shows were excellent on TV.. and both made for good MOVIES.. but it does not hold the same Quirkiness, Quick and or Constant Nonsense of what makes the show a show.. but its so nice to have two full hours with your favorite characters who do it so well.

Godzilla and Kaiju fans like me will adore this film. However, it tries too hard to delve into it's human characters motivations, which are completely outlandish and taken too seriously. The movie knows what people want, Sci-Fi Kaiju Battles, and it absolutely delivers. It's just a shame that it doesn't entirely capitalize on that concept. Instead it tries to make more of it's human characters than it needs to, resulting in annoyingly boring sections of the movie a chore to sit through. In a desperate attempt to make the human's in a monster movie more serious and relevant than what they need to be, it almost misses the point of it's own outlandish movie plot. Almost.

Whenever Kaiju are on screen, the movie shines and is incredibly rewarding and entertaining, making you remember why exactly you wanted to watch this film, and ultimately, you will be more than satisfied. After separating the wheat from the chaff, you see a Godzilla film, a worthy one at that. Therefore, I am more than pleased with King of the Monsters as a massive fan of the franchise, I just wish the overly serious yet insanely stupid human elements didn't drag it down."

But I simply enjoyed the battle of monsters. A long time ago, actors had to wear Gozilla's rubber suits. But CGI is very beautiful.

I love baseball. I love Fenway Park! But the battle scenes are very dark. It is hard to see. King Ghidra is supposed to be gold. Mothra is supposed to be beautiful. But both of them are too dark.

1131,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,FilipeNeto,"Mar 2, 2020",8,"With a somewhat inventive history, it has better interpretations and production values ​​than its predecessor.

This film is the predictable sequel to ""Godzilla"", with the appearance of a legion of monstrous creatures called Titans. I liked, in general, the 2014 film, and I went to see this film with some interest, believing that finally Godzilla was having a more interesting treatment from the cinema. And I confess that I am not disappointed, as the film is even better than its predecessor in some important points.

The film takes the point where the previous one ended and reveals to us the efforts made since then, to create a way of understanding and reproducing the vocalizations of the monsters already awake. It is with this technology that Emma Russel, allied with a group of mercenaries, tries to wake up the sleeping monsters that Monarch monitors. She thinks it will restore a natural balance in the world, perhaps through a massacre. I confess that I found this part of the script somewhat confusing. Against her is ex-husband Mark, who argues that all monsters should simply be killed or left to sleep. It doesn't matter, the fact is that they wake up the only one who should have been left to sleep: the Guidorah hydra, the only one that has the capacity to wake everyone up and control them to slaughter Humanity. It is now up to Godzila and her fellow humans to contain this threat, even if it means the partial destruction of the world.

As in the previous film, there are good and bad things in this story. It's a little hard to believe that creatures like that would spend thousands of years sleeping without being detected by curious humans. On the other hand, the film makes good use of material from classic legends involving monsters (Scilla, Kong, the Loch Ness Monster, Hydra and others). I was not convinced by the supposed alien origins of Hydra, I think it is a little credible detail of the script. There is also a time when everyone seems to stumble over Atlantean civilization, but that is never even mentioned.

The cast's work is more enjoyable in this film than in its predecessor. For a start, I felt that there were more possibilities to connect with the characters. This bet made the film gain more interest as we feel more involved in the action and care more about what happens. Godzilla, in this respect, is a character in his own right. Among the human cast I would positively highlight Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga. Both do a good job, even though the character of Farmiga is very difficult to understand and unworthy of our sympathy. Watanabe continues to maintain the good performance that started in the previous film, ending it brilliantly. I don't know if all the merit belongs to the actor or if the screenwriter also reserved better material for the actor, but the truth is that it worked very well. Bradley Whitford, Aisha Hinds, Ziyi Zhang and Sally Hawkins do a good job of support. Millie Bobby Brown is almost left in the film and has little to do but be in danger when the script needs an extra reason for the characters to move faster.

The film maintained the good production values ​​of its predecessor. And there is no doubt that there is a lot of money invested. A grandiose and impressive CGI, with scenarios of pure destruction everywhere, the bet on a more luminous environment, which allows the public to better see the destruction of the world and the epic battles that are fought among the human ruins. Now we see better what the first film kept wrapped in dust and shadows. The monstrous creatures also seem to me better worked and realistic. We also have impressive sound and visual effects, good post-production work, with excellent mixing and editing, well-crafted special effects, good sets, costumes and props.

Overall, it is a satisfying action and sci-fi film, with a somewhat elaborate story that works well if we don't think about it too much. You can pass the time, although it is not a work of cinema art. Godzilla will certainly continue to be a recurring monster in cinema, even though it does not give rise to really good films."

I only realized one of them died when I watched a YouTube review if this movie. the reason for the monsters fighting isn't really explained either. and if it is, it's not communicated well and I missed it. is Godzilla fighting to keep things in check? are they all just jockeying for position? idk in short, great movie to throw on the tv for the popcorn value, but nothing deeper or more meaningful. a high budget sharknado."

1146,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/morgan/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,HotelCentral,"Feb 24, 2019",7,"The story here is a bit on the predictable side, but pretty solid and well-constructed, which is a good indication that Ridley Scott had very little to do with the story.

The thought that kept me guessing concerns the Lee Weathers character.  She is played in a very non-emotional (almost robotic) way.  So my first guess was maybe she's a hybrid too.  But if Morgan is the most advanced hybrid to come along, as seems to be implied, then why would anyone take the chance of letting the Lee Weathers hybrid run around on her own.  And if you want the answer to this you'll have to watch to the end.  And I do recommend you watch it to the end.

The main flaw in the film, of course, is that a corporation with the moral compass to utilize trained assassins as ""risk management specialists"" would surely have put some kind of ""security"" operative on the site of the science project that produces ""Morgan,"" simply because it makes more sense to have an assassin there before things go wrong, rather than hours or days after the fact. The obvious choice would've been the only person not trained as a scientist (i.e. the cook and nutritionist), but somebody missed that one by a mile and my guess is it was Scott, since he seems to miss the boat on a lot of things, especially when it comes to story.

But on the whole it's a good film and definitely worth a try.

Why all the negative reviews?  Well, in the beginning of the film there's a lot of characters engaging in dialog.  They don't have guns or rocket launchers in their hands while doing this dialog thing.  They're not even talking like they're really mad.  It's all about developing the ""story.""  It's about drama, tension, suspense.  Unfortunately, a lot of people think that blazing guns and bloody splatter defines what ""drama"" should be."

La palette des sentiments est vaste mais il faut croire que l'on a pas pu reproduire l'empathie, un thème hélas pas vraiment abordé ici mais qui aurait mérité que l'on se penche sur le sujet. Le film se cantonne donc au thriller classique avec dérapages à la clé comme dans tout projet très expérimental de ce genre. Notre petite Morgane est en tout cas aussi mignonne qu'ambigüe et fort bien interprétée par la petite Anya.

D'autres seconds couteaux assez connus se sont joints à la fête (Yeoh, Giamatti, Cox et le gars de la série Narcos...) et surtout la très jolie Kate Mara en inspectrice des travaux pas finis, très étonnante ici.

1153,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/morgan/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DotTheEyes,"Sep 3, 2016",7,"In Morgan, a hypnotic visual style and an enviable ensemble of character actors compensate for fairly predictable—though still engaging—storytelling.  The plot turns on an icy corporate analyst (Kate Mara) who travels to a remote compound to assess the viability of an artificial-intelligence research project.  Her visit is precipitated by a violent incident involving Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy), the team's five-year-old laboratory miracle.  Morgan's caregivers-cum-captors are played by, among others, Toby Jones, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Game of Thrones' Rose Leslie.  Nothing is particularly novel here—the peril of self-preservation among A.I., an ethical suspicion of biotechnology, a third-act emphasis on chasing and bloodshed after a setup in the vein of Agatha Christie or Clue—but first-time feature director Luke Scott (son of Ridley and a member of the second unit on his father's Exodus: Gods and Kings) commands attention with a steadily mounting sense of dread and sumptuous use of misty, verdant forest locations in Northern Ireland.  He at least copies and lifts from the best, including Ex Machina and dad's Alien, to create his late-summer genre diversion.  And Taylor-Joy, so transfixing in The Witch earlier this year, delivers another enigmatic performance as the title figure; she is at once naïvely disarming and eerily otherworldly in conveying the character's just-shy-of-human nature.  The way Morgan is at once protagonist and antagonist, both brutal and sympathetic, is one of the film's chief pleasures."

1157,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sonic-the-hedgehog/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Scryptkeeper,"Mar 21, 2025",7,"“Sonic the Hedgehog” is a fast-paced action/adventure film that successfully brings the iconic blue blur to the live-action scene, and as of the making of this review, is currently the highlight of the (thus far) trilogy of Paramount films. Thanks in large part to its dedicated character chemistry, slick battle sequences, and solid story beats, this memorable interpretation of SEGA’s iconic mascot is a must-watch for both fans of the franchise and newcomers alike.Concerning the plot, the movie runs through Sonic’s backstory at a brisk pace, simultaneously setting up his world-traveling motive and secretive place within the quaint town of Green Hills. Upon inadvertently unleashing a large scale electric burst that attracts the attention of the government, Sonic soon finds himself in the sights of the eccentric genius, Dr. Robotnik, and loses access to his warp rings upon bumping into the town’s chief peace officer, Tom. After a tense first encounter with Robotnik and his lethal drones, both Sonic and Tom hit the road to recover the lost rings, during which the two gradually bond and form a strong friendship. The game of cat and mouse continues to escalate until all persons involved are in place for the climactic showdown to ensue, and it does not disappoint.Tonally speaking, the film manages to walk the fine line of balancing comedic and serious moments from start to finish; allowing each side of the coin to compliment the other. Most of the humor was interwoven into the dialogue and narrative in clever ways and rarely felt silly for the sake of being silly (which unfortunately becomes a staple of later installments). And while the story itself is nothing exceedingly special, it was a suitable scenario for a new universe setting outside of the series’ **** for the primary cast, the voice talent of Ben Schwartz brought Sonic to life in a way that nailed his carefree nature while avoiding some of the more cringy interpretations the character has seen through prior media. Jim Carrey’s first outing as Robotnik was by far his best, as he was able to masterfully convey both a wit-driven humor and palpable menace in equal measure; something that is sadly lost as the movies have continued. James Marsden’s “Tom” offered up a reasonably compelling secondary arch to play in par with Sonic’s, with his wife Maddie (Tika Sumpter) adding just the right amount of presence to round out their characters. By far one of the most redeeming facets of the film is the CGI upgrade Sonic received after his first imagining (as seen in the trailer) was rightfully savaged by fans. It is a rare example, especially in modern years, of a company listening to feedback and being rewarded in turn. Concerning aesthetics, the music style and utility is spot on in most instances, and the visual elements of Sonic’s powers and Robotnik’s machines are an absolute treat. In conclusion, “Sonic the Hedgehog” (or “Sonic 1”) is an excellent videogame movie that taps into just enough nostalgia to compliment its own story and narrative without resembling itself to a soulless cash-grab that more than a few of its peers have typically gone the way of. At its core it is a family friendly adventure that manages to avoid sacrificing quality for “kiddy content” by carefully juxtaposing elements favored by younger and mature audiences rather than outright eliminating one or cramming both together in an exceedingly jarring manner."

Yeah, it plays it kinda safe and there’s definitely some plot holes mixed with the occasional spot of cringe humor. But all of this is infrequent enough and not egregious enough to blanket an otherwise, safely solid story about finding your family. Ben Schwartz and Jim Carrey are definitely doing interpretations of Sonic and Robotnik to a degree, but it works under the pretense of this being their earliest encounter and I’ve never seen James Marsden in a movie I didn’t enjoy. Music is the big letdown here. Sonic games have always had great music, but this is just a serviceable mix of orchestra meant to sound techno-ish to evoke a video game feel. At best, you’ll occasionally hear Green Hill Zone. Obviously, the CGI looks great for the most part, especially when the director actually listened to fans and had Sonic redesigned on short notice. All in all, I recommend Sonic as a reliable watch. It’s not perfect, but it did feel like a catalyst that changed the stigma around video game movies as always being bad adaptations."

I've been a Sonic fan practically my whole life, I've experienced it's missteps like Sonic 2006 (underrated game, just saying, but I'm aware how bad it did) and Sonic boom rise of lyric and it's successes (like Sonic Unleashed, Sonic generations and the latest Sonic Frontiers). Did this adaption of the iconic blue blur disappoint? No. The story is charming and great to follow, there are countless game references that will make any fan fall in love and Sonic's final design was amazing and not a monstrosity like the original design we got back when they showed the first trailer back in mid 2019. Jim Carrey did a great job as Dr Robotnik, which was to be expected. Fans will love it, kids will love it, the whole family will love it.

We follow Owen Chase, a whaler who is crossed by the Nantucket family by not granting him the title of Captain. He has to get along with Pollard, a Nantucket family member who gets to be captain by heritage. Both set out on their ship to collect Whale oil, which at that time is used to light candles. After suffering poor results in their hunt for whales, they decide to sail over a 1000 nautical miles to find a supposed hotspot of whales. Things go wrong and a great white whale sinks their ship, leaving them stranded in the middle of the pacific ocean. After facing hunger, cannibalism, insanity and thirst, they find rescue.

So, the movie tells a pretty straight forward story. It goes into surprisingly much detail at times, yet completely shies away from anything that could be R rated. The whales are all shot in CGI (no surprise there) but fail to look very realistic. At times shots are even re-used, which comes across a bit lazy. The characters all seem to lack conviction in their portrayal.

It was enjoyable to watch nonetheless. I learned more stuff about whailing. I give it a 7/10."

Ron Howard's latest sea adventure, stars Chris Hemsworth in an important role. So the people comparing it with 'Moby ****', because both the film is about the same story, but one was inspired and the other one was, I mean this film was based on the actual event. I had seen the BBC film 'The Whale', not a bad film for a low budget television film. Most importantly, it revealed the truth about what I was not aware of from one of my favourite sea adventure films.

I never read the book, but saw the British version, so I knew what I'm going to witness. Still, I was very interested to check it out, because it is a grand film and as expected I loved the visuals. Those sea adventures were very realistic, except the action sequences which is obviously cinema gimmick. The surprise part was the narration. It was a flashback story, something like 'Life of Pi', a man recall his old memory of his survival at the sea with other crew members of the ship Essex when it was attacked by a big white whale.

It is kind of impossible to believe what this film says is true. And obviously what we see is not what exactly happened, but very close. So see this film to believe it. Whatever it is, I totally enjoyed watching it. The 2 hour long never looked too long. There are a few mild disturbing scenes due to the theme concept, but it is a good family film. If you like 'Moby ****' then you should watch it. Definitely an underrated film by the film critics.

Why didn't this movie get more Oscar consideration for these awards.  Actually, the biggest problem with the film is that the white whale encounter isn't dramatic or terrifying enough.

I believe both have the exact same script problem.  It may be easier to see in Everest.  We like the characters but we never know much of WHY they do what they do--because it was not in the book.  So the miraculous recovery of the Outside reporter played by Josh Brolin lacks the backstory to buttress an amazing acting performance.

I agree with Anthony Lane in New Yorker that we don't get to see enuf of a character arc in any character in Heart of the Sea to engage us that much.

Not all ""inspired by true events"" scripts hold water.  But in this regard Bridge of Spies (2015) is a master class in how to cobble together true life characters and detail into a story with dramatic meaning.

The spectacle of Everest and Heart of Sea are not enuf, probably can never be enuf, to compensate for engaging dramatic construction.  This is why do few film scripts exist each year; so few have an authentic or archetypal dramatic story with adequate character arcs to tell."

In my opinion, if you are not attached to expectations based on Moby **** or on the actual In The Heart of The Sea book, you will be stunned by the marvelous visual art in the movie (take together everything, cinematography, visual effects, costumes, soundtrack, all impeccable), the solid acting, the intriguing plot, and the involving atmosphere. As the story unfolds, the viewer may feel, at some points, that some reflections that the movie tries to provoke are left hanging and unfinished. However, in the end, when the main plot finds its way, all the little things that were left hanging during the movies become teasers that leave you with a bittersweet sensation of ""I wanted a little more"".

While that's a big part, this narrative expands to become a story of survival at sea. The encounters with the CGI creatures, as well as a harrowing storm, are amazingly rendered. On top of that, the grand style of the cinematography and rich look of the art direction add a layer of visual majesty. Then there's the actual drama: It unfolds with encounters and relationships that are too trite, flashes back to the storyteller (which halts the pace) and never really creates characters that are compelling (even Chris Hemworth seems like yet another superhero). The film attempts to be grand storytelling in a classic vein (albeit with lots of quick cuts), but lacks the spirit to capture the heart."

Whilst several scenes stuck with you on an emotional level, Brendan Gleeson's narration was superb and the story was immersive at times, a lack of character development, mixed visual effects and an over reliance on a narrative that shifted its focus off the whale itself, harm the film overall. Whilst the film experience was a positive one, I was left slightly underwhelmed as the story had potential to provide for something far more gripping."

It's very similar to Shutter Island in how the movie feels and how it's set up, and artistically it's similar to Verbinski's other horror endeavor The Ring. If you liked either of those movies, you'll definitely like this.

Even beyond that, I thought it's a very well done mystery film. The characters are interesting and compelling, the story has a plausible plot that still has nice twists and turns, and the payoff at the end is very satisfying. It also has some really interesting motifs that are carried throughout the film, and themes that are subtly built up until the end. Thinking back you can sort of piece together things you maybe didn't realize were connected. It's imperfect, but still a creepy, mysterious, captivating movie. If you're the kind of person that saw the trailer and thought it looked good, you'll like the movie - it delivers on its promises."

1245,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-cure-for-wellness/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Spangle,"Jun 7, 2017",8,"A Cure for Wellness was a film destined for disaster. A film set in a sanitarium dedicated to providing a ""cure"" to its wealthy patients, the film was immediately pinned as being a similar film to Shutter Island. With its mansion-setting that holds various secrets, a similar production design, and a protagonist running around reassuring everybody that he is not a patient, it is obvious why many critics and filmgoers drew the comparison. Yet, even if the film does try and hint towards this delusion at times, it is always a distraction for Lockhart (Dane DeHaan). It is not the truth. The audience knows it throughout and he knows it throughout. Instead, this is a film straight out of the late 1990s dressed up to be a psychological thriller set in a place with many dark secrets.

Using a horror film setup for its execution, the film is set on top of a hill in a small village in Switzerland. Introducing us to Lockhart, an ambitious and smarmy financial services salesman, the film shows him to be dispatched to the sanitarium to find his company's CEO who has disappeared to the sanitarium right before a big merger. Now, with rumors of the merger being in trouble, the stock price is tanking and the CEO needs to come back and sign off on the merger before there is nothing left to merge. Upon arriving, Lockhart quickly determines that this is a place with secrets. Filled to the brim with rich patients who left their lives of seeming luxury to find a cure to become well, the place is run by Dr. Heinreich Volmer (Jason Isaacs). Held there, along with the patients, is a ""special case"" named Hannah (Mia Goth). With classic horror film stories of a Baron who used to live in the mansion and similarly sought a cure for his sister/wife's infertility by running experiments on peasant villagers, only for the whole mansion and his sister/wife to be burned by the villagers, the film is immediately eerie and unsettling. Unrolling this information throughout, it becomes all the more apparent that this is still happening today for a very similar purpose.

The film draws comparisons to Shutter Island through this setup about a mysterious old mansion and through a line said by Lockhart's mother early on in the film. Handing him a new ballerina she has sculpted, she tells him that this ballerina is special and different from the others she has made. Compared to the others, this one's eyes are closed and is dreaming. This, as we quickly learn, is Hannah. Both are not just described as special, but both wear blue and are in a world where they are not aware of the fact that they are dreaming and deluded. With scenes of awful treatments and mysteries lying around every corner, director Gore Verbinski cultivates a classic asylum-esque feeling to the film that constantly keeps the audience on edge and uncertain as to what lies around the corner. These terrible experiments and the pain endured by Lockhart and others kept hostage in the sanitarium is unspeakable and why the film has earned a reputation for being entirely messed up. Yet, either it is not nearly as messed up as billed or my tastes in film are more messed up than previously imagined.

The film further distracts the audience with more parallels to Shutter Island that attempt to distract the viewer from realizing the truth behind the narrative. These distractions include instances where the doctors track down Lockhart and Hannah in the village and convince the similarly medicated police chief that Lockhart is delusional, scenes of ""hallucinations"" and dreams of eels everywhere, and Lockhart himself coming to believe he is delusional. Yet, the audience constantly knows better. Even when he begins to doubt his own mind, we saw him in the beginning as a regular guy in a financial services company tasked with coming to Switzerland. There should be no delusion here due to this fact, further underscoring how everything at the sanitarium is a massive cover-up, right? Yes and no. The sanitarium is both a terrifying and exploitative scam, but Lockhart is also delusional.

This is where the film breaks free and is why it is unfortunate for it to be nothing more than a Shutter Island rehash. Instead, it is far more apt to compare the film to the films of 1999 such as Fight Club, American Beauty, or Office Space. Perhaps, on the surface, this seems an odd comparison, but thematically it is the exact same film. Opening with a scene of a man named Morris working late at night and suffering a heart attack, Verbinski shows us shots of the man's family in a photo on the shelf. With him working late, it is clear that he is largely unable to spend much time with his family. Lockhart's own father, who also worked for the same financial services company that Lockhart now works for, took his own life after being ruined at work. Lockhart, until he goes to Switzerland, is always working. Those who use the sanitarium ran to go get the ""cure"" after feeling unfulfilled in their lives of work."

However, in light of an original plot and almost 3 solid hours of pure aesthetic **** goodness, I'm willing to overlook this. I wish they would have taken the darker themes even further.

Contrasted with some of the fantastical imagery in the rest of the film and absolutely haunting score, the films bears some extremely beautiful and memorable moments. The movie is quite long but after say the first 20 minutes I never felt like it was dragging. I've seen a lot of criticism on the story being 'predictable' and though there are a few plot points I guessed in advance I was very satisfied with the story at the conclusion of the film, although this was marred slightly by some cliche moments mostly towards the beginning of the film. Interesting characters, great actors, effective action, great film overall."
1252,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-cure-for-wellness/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,whitmorgan7,"Mar 10, 2017",8,"Yes. Yes. Yes. I have only the utmost respect for this movie and what they did with it. Shutter Island meets Crimson Peak meets American Horror Story:Asylum meets Martyrs. It has a twist at the end that I don’t think someone with perfect vision could see coming. It is wildy perfect and it had me guessing up until the last moments of the movie. There were a lot of things I saw that I wish I could unsee, but at the same time it was so perfect I’m glad I saw them.

I can’t even decide where to start first. Do I start with how brilliant the movie was in terms of story? Do I talk about the acting, and how beautifully it was film? Do I talk about Verbanski and how amazing he did? Dane DeHaan, who I think is one of the most underrated actors in the spotlight, stars as Lockhart, a Wall Street stockbroker who’s gotten himself into a little bit of trouble fudging the company’s financial statements. They send him to bring him the company’s CEO, Roland Pembroke, who has seemingly went crazy at a “spa wellness center” in Switzerland, merely to pin all of the company’s wrongs on him. Upon arriving he encounters some of the strange residents of the wellness center, signs in at the front desk as a visitor, and meets the mysterious doctor in charge, Dr. Heinreich Volmer, portrayed by Jason Isaacs(Hello Lucius). Dr. Volmer informed him that visiting hours were over, and that he could come back the next day, so Lockhart leaves to get a room somewhere to stay the night, he notices a young woman walking around on top of one of the buildings but shrugs it off.

The next scene was one of the most brilliantly filmed scenes in the entire movie. While driving away from center, a deer runs out in front of the car and there is a major car accident. Seeing the visual effects in this scene were perfect, you get to see the outside of the car plus peeks of the inside and how everything looks while the car is flipping. I can’t tell you how amazing of a visual effect this was. Lockhart wakes up the next day in a room of the wellness center and learns about the accident and that his leg is broken. They instruct him to drink plenty of water and get some rest, as soon as he’s all better he can be on his way with Pembroke. Lockhart decides to explore the center and finally meets Hannah, the mysterious girl from the day prior. She tells him no one ever leaves the wellness center, and the reason she is there at such a young age is because she’s a “special case” and once she’s better her father will come get her. After running some tests on Lockhart, Volmer tells him that he his sick and recommends he stays for a treatment, to which Lockhart agrees. This tests his sanity and his well-being as a whole.

There are so many important aspects to this film I couldn’t possibly write them all down without spoiling some important plot. Every character in this film has a purpose, no one stone is left unturned. By far one of the most important characters is Victoria Watkins, a patient who tells Lockhart stories about how the wellness center was once a castle owned by a Baron and his wife. She tells him how the baron wanted a family that was of “pure blood” and the baroness was actually his sister, but she was infertile. He began to do tests on the local townspeople in order to find a cure for her infertility. The townspeople eventually revolted and burned down the castle, and in the process cut the baroness’ baby from her womb, tossing it into the water. Watkins believed the baby actually survived, but everyone else perished.

With respect to spoilers, I have to stop the review of the plot here. The cast of this film was stellar. Dane DeHaan, Jason Isaacs, Mia Goth, Celia Imrie, I could go on and on with the cast. Everyone was perfect in the role they played. The acting was excellent and really did justice to the **** in my mind, DeHaan is really going places someday. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for him, I think he will do great things with his career, and this movie shows how talented he can be.

As far as uncomfortable scenes in the movie, there are scenes to make any claustrophobic squirm in their seats, anyone who is afraid of water will turn their heads, and if you have a problem with anything bad happening to teeth you will cover your eyes and ears. There’s a particular scene in a dentist chair that I still cannot get out of my mind.

When asked after how the movie was from a friend, I had to stop and tell them to ask me once I had time to process what I had seen. I am thoroughly impressed with the direction of this film and the guts they had in making it. Most people won’t enjoy this film as much as me, basically because it is different. It is weird. It isn’t your typical mainstream horror/sci-fi film, but that’s half of what makes it perfect. Narrow-minded people might even leave the movie early. Trust me, it is worth it to stay for the entire movie and have an open mind."

Granted, there are no perfectly consistent answers for minor details but that might be for the better to not bring in more confusion and the movie works without those explanations anyway. Overall a very solid and entertaining movie that is definitely worth being watched - if not for the story then at least for the great acting of the main cast as well as the atmosphere and the location.

Where he kicks lots of butte. In this one he's like a ghost. Trying to be like the bourne identity. Still a decent movie though.

The original source is a long book series, so they did not do it in order. Like the first film, which was based on the ninth book, this one was on the eighteenth. It was a stylishly made film. The actors were good, and their stunts were excellent. But not the storyline. This is a very familiar theme. You know, someone framed you and you go on to dig the truth while everyone trying to hunt you down. There are lots of close encounter, which give great thrilling entertainment. So, other than the story, everything looked fine.

Jack goes to meet one of his ex colleagues at his old headquarters. But soon he discovers she's behind the bars and now he's too for the crime they did not do. So escaping from the prison and looking for clues, who framed them and why, all one by one disclosed with some excellent running-chasing action sequences. The film almost as good as any timepass action film. But like it was the new wine in an old bottle. So it won't work for everyone, especially those with greater expectations.

The 55 year old Tom Cruise on the edge to become a veteran actor, but still he got that action hero macho in him. Probably another 3-4 films, including the upcoming 'Mission: Impossible' sequel. So this franchise could replace his cast with younger one in the future. Because another 20 books to go. Though, I'm thinking about the television series. Cobie too was awesome. The film justifies to its original, but not more than an above average. So good for once watching it.

Cruise holds up as the unbeatable but far from invincible Reacher, and Cobie Smulders as well as Danika Yarosh both play nicely against him in their differing roles. It lacks the intrigue of the first film(and the novels), and there are a few dubious jumps of logic, as well as dialog left unexplored, but the plot is easily followed and enjoyed. The biggest failing is a hold over from the first film, where the big baddie is nearly useless and the true adversary is some lacky that is built up to be Reacher's equal. In the end, the conflict wraps up like a less interesting Bourne film rather than the climactic face off you're hoping for. All in all though, worth watching if you are feeling an action film and have seen the first Jack Reacher film, but otherwise, go for the first one."

Tom Cruise was my dream man when I was in high school and I saw him playing volleyball in his jeans and no shirt in ""Top Gun."" I asked my dad for the VHS for christmas and he looked at me a long time and said ""Ain't you already seen it?""

I said I did and he took a sip of his Schlitz can and asked cruelly, ""Then why the he!!! would you pay money to see it again?""

He didn't understand. Never did. Still he's gone now and while I would struggle to say I miss him, I would say I wish we were closer when he was alive. He never came to terms with my lifestyle and I am sure he would be embarrassed that I make my living as a cage dancer in the Keys.

'The Dressmaker', to put it bluntly, is quality! It has a pulse and then some, I love the feel of the film throughout - with all its quirkiness, silliness and straight up brilliantness. It all starts off very strongly, though I did then feel a (very minor) plateau. However, to my surprise, it shoots straight back up as it culminates with a super ending.

Kate Winslet is top notch from beginning to end with an excellent performance, though isn't alone as the support cast all give very good performances - from Judy Davis to Hugo Weaving. I also note Liam Hemsworth, Alison Whyte and, at a certain point, Geneviève Lemon.

What a great film, full of twists n turns and it has a fantastic score. Loved it!"

A stylish Aussie revenge-comedy that is adapted from a novel of the same name. Just superbly built screenplay on a tragedy that occurred some time back, but the movie reveals it only in the third act. About a woman who arrives in a small town where she was born and slowly gains popularity among the young women who seeks her stunning costumes to impress their counterparts. The town divides over her return, but why all the hate is the mystery that the movie going to solve for us in its entire narration.

The location and the settings were fantastic and it brought a western feel because of the Australians hot and humid weather. Kate Winslate was very good, her role simply reminded me Juliette Binoche from 'Chocolat'. I have heard people saying it was emotional, but I did not find it like that. Instead, I had fun watching it, not like I had the open laughs, but felt joy and satisfaction for the time I spent for it. My initial thought was it could be overrated, but after watching it proved I was wrong. This is one of the best Aussie movie I have seen in the recent years.

It is a funny, emotional, odd and very enjoyable film with some first rate actors who nail it (especially Kate Winslet and the one playing her mother in the film). A character´s movie that will probably surprise you. It is a little bit flat when it comes to the mystery subplot. But it serves its purpose. The best part is the sarcastic way of depicting characters. Recommendable."

This is a real curio of a black comedy that has a perfectly cast Kate Winslet returning to the small Australian town of Dungaten after being banished as a young girl for a murder she may, or may not, have committed. The town’s people constitute a strange and eclectic bunch. Amongst the saner residents are Liam Hemsworth as the obvious handsome suitor and Hugo weaving as the police officer with a secret, also responsible for sending Winslet’s character away. Best of all is scene stealer Judy Davis as mad Molly, Winslet’s mother with a secret or two of her own. She is great, tossing off witty or acidic throwaways with consummate ease. The film is genuinely funny and taps into the black humour wonderfully, a rare achievement in itself. The costumes and music are divine and the general tone of the film hits its mark. Unfortunately, it does go on a tad too long which is detrimental to the overall impact."

The movie does a phenomenal job at representing the game, Monster Hunter, and maintains the mood and suspense throughout the movie. The movie provides a newer experience for the game’s fanbase and introduces the world to the game in an innovative way. Whether critics give this movie a ruthless or a wholesome review, it has shaped the industry in plenty of ways. Going from a game can be difficult but the director does a phenomenal job at crafting this movie in a suspenseful and thrilling manner. I think this movie is one of those movies everyone should watch at least once for Milla Jovovich’s terrific acting performance. Her acting is spot on throughout the film and the plot makes you feel as if you are inside the game.

There are some horrific, violent images in the first 20 minutes of this movie very much not suited for young eyes. At one point I wasn’t sure if there was going to be a murder suicide on screen. That aside, I really liked this movie. If you’re a fan of Ron Perlman and Milla Jovovich they don’t disappoint here. I just wish Ron had more screen time. While it is based on the video games of the same name, the story and visuals are a fantasy hodgepodge of “Pitch Black,” “Dune,” “Alien” with a touch of “Tremors” and several other films. While that sounds disastrous there is so much that it can claim its own and kept the movie feeling fresh. Well, as fresh as a Paul W. S. Anderson film can be. So many times I couldn’t quite tell where it was going, and while that’s great I also felt like it was over before it had really started. My one complaint is all of the electronic parts in the score. The the sequenced synthesizers just didn’t fit the overall aesthetic of the movie. They felt like they were invoking a more “Sci-Fi” feel. More traditional orchestrations would have been better."

Editing is not the strongest point here as the war effort strecthed out all perspective. right until the US had to guess whether who won due to poor radio communication.

I have seen my share of war movies, and ""Midway"" was one of the better ones in that genre.  The movie attempted to be accurate historically.  The Japanese were not reduced to caricatures, as they so often are in WW II flicks.  I am not a connoisseur of CGI, and I don't know that I can tell when it is being employed well or poorly.  I thought the battle scenes were depicted realistically.

Perhaps the fact that this is a traditional rather than an artsy-fartsy recounting of an epic battle in a pivotal war in modern human history is what has earned it only a grudging golf-clap from the pajama boys in the critical community.  Normal Americans no doubt will appreciate it a lot more."

In addition, although I am not a WW2 buff and was discharged in 1963 from the U.S. Naval Air Corps, other aspects of the movie that would not have existed during my enlistment, could have been 20 years in the past.

The movement of the plot was interesting, the soap kept to a minimum, unlike the Charleston Heston film of the 1970s and the action was believable. If, though, you prefer to watch unbelievable car chases and fighting where a single emaciated male, employing martial arts, defeats a dozen weight lifter, this film would not, in the least, interest you"
1317,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/midway/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Vickimage,"Jan 30, 2020",9,I was mighty impressed with this movie. Some would call it old-fashioned but instead I would label it “classic” as it harks back to the likes of Twelve O’Clock High and the John Ford war movies (Ford is a minor character in this movie as he shot documentary footage during the battle of Midway). Emmerich doesn’t try to be flashy. He tries to simply tell the tale as historically accurately as possible. That lack of flash pays off because anyone watching the battle scenes can only marvel at the bravery of the young men who put their life on the line amidst the hail of artillery fire coming their way. The critics (again!) got it wrong with their bad reviews. Highly recommended.

It tries to put you so much in context, that it doesn't focus on the main event. In fact Midway is as much about Pearl Harbour for half the movie. That said the FX are absolutely amazing. The aerial combats are superb. The acting is a mix bag. A bit of overacting but mostly it's acceptable. The movie is still very informative about the event. Even on the Japanese side, which I found to be a nice touch. I especially like how the film was ending. I give it 72%. Yes, I know, it is a Roland Emmerich show. But in terms of war movie, this is a very nice effort, enough to draw interest into the real events."

It's nicely photographed, looks good, effects are hit and miss but $100m is not a big budget these days.  Patrick Wilson is always good, haven't seen Dennis Quaid in a while.  The biggest surprise is a shortage of corny dialog. Woody Harrelson is the main chief, handles it well. Christie Brooke was good, nice to see a strong female.  It was exciting to see familiar ships like the Nautilus and Enterprise.  Apparently a very expensive independent movie, a passion project for Emmerich.  I am not a big fan of Emmerich, but the color palette, period setting and dogfights were very good.  The fighter planes diving on the carriers was as thrilling as anything I ever saw."

The CGI and color does look a bit too modern considering that this is a reproduction of the original ones. However, the culture (dress, house, sceneries) settings are OK. This movie focuses on all things STRONGLY related to Midway missions from USA's side, including Doolittle Raid (which is to show Japanese how they COULD ALSO bite back from far away to their mainland). One bit of critic is that Emmerich does not maximize/include heavy atmosphere and stories of the Enterprise failing to join at Coral Sea war, considering Battle of Coral Sea is USA's first major all-out naval attacks before Midway (as far as I know, cmiiw)."

Midway takes a true-to-real-life-events approach to showing the build up to the battle that changed the odds for the Pacific War. Instead of showing only a heroic, romanticized and ideal portrayal of soldiers and the battle, the movie shows many problems the US navy faced. It makes the characters' situation feel tense, and you'll start to feel scared for them as they go into combat.

The actors did an excellent job, and i like how the makers of the movie didn't shy away from using technical terms. It's a fantastic movie, and i give it a 9/10."

Having had my father and three uncles serving in WW2, it's nice to see that people still remember when America was a great nation."
1335,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/midway/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,PurpleHeart1964,"Nov 16, 2019",7,"Most reviews about “Midway” movie were negative, and frankly, I believe it is unfairly received by many the movie critics on the internet.

The Battle of Midway Island in 1942 was one of the most significant battle WW2, and it is believed to be more significant than the allies’ landing in Normandy, June 6th, 1944.  Because in 1944 the **** was so badly beaten at all three fronts, Eastern Front, the West, and Italy campaign, the landing of Normandy is symbolic significance, but not earth-shaken like Midway’s.  Had the US Navy failed to stop Japan’s invasion of Midway, most of Asia today, would likely be speaking Japanese as the primary language.

The US Navy in 1942, was barely recovered from the disaster bombing at Pearl Harbor.  The US only upper hand against the Japanese was its code-breaking advantage.  The US knew in advance of the Japan’s plan to create diversionary invasion on the Aleutian Island chains (part of Alaska), and decided to commit all of its remaining carrier strength against the Japanese naval forces headed for Midway, and in an incredible stroke of luck, decimated the Japanese seaborn invasion force, and Japan would never again fought on the offensive at sea, for the rest of WW2.

The new film about Midway, is not as exciting as the history itself.  It does have good special effects, but most of the big shots are CGI (computer generated FX).  But you cannot really blame on the extensive use of FX for the film, since there are so few WW2 planes left in the world that are still flyable.  For example, there are only 1 known Japanese Mitsubishi Zero that still can be flown, privately owned by American collector, and most of pre-war US Navy planes today only exist in museums or in B&W photographs.  Therefore, CGI generated Dauntless dive bombers and Devastators torpedo planes are the only option for use in such epic scale.

The factual details provided in the film are very good, and unlike the disaster 2001 film title of “Pearl Harbor”, nearly all portraying events are also historically accurate, although sensationalized.  I do find the actors and portrayal of young US sailors and airmen are a bit “superficial” about the way they talk and behave, for men in 1940s don’t throw fists when they won.  Most are relief that they survived, just so to prepare for a fight in another bloody campaign.  The film “Midway” itself is gutsy enough to include the execution of captured US airman, who were tied to jerry cans, and then tossed overboard by the Japanese in vengeance for the battle lost at Midway.  A sharp jab at Japan’s atrocities in WW2, as mentioned in the movie, is no surprise.  Chinese investment firms co-sponsored this movie project.  Ironically, China’s current expansion to usurp most of the South China Sea may become the next show-down between the world’s two super powers.

I feel that the opinions and reviews about film “Midway” is quite unfair and narrow-minded.  The movie is NOT that bad, and it is quite good and entertaining.  Some idiot movie critics expect “Midway” to be like as exciting as “Saving Private Ryan”, an expectation that is not just comparable – one movie is pure fiction, and other is a reenactment, story-telling of history.  For some reasons, I found that most Americans are tired of the subject of war.  The current, and longest war fought in Afghanistan for the US, along with multiple conflicts in the Middle East, appears to dampen most of American views and enthusiasm about victory in war, and many more with liberal views are simply sick of the subject of war.   While being a ‘movie buff’, I came to appreciate theatrical war films that accurate portray events, and don’t exaggerate or wander too far from facts.  Let’s face it, if war movies were made super accurate, few would pay to go see them in this day and age.  Had this ‘Midway’ film has better cast in names, with veteran, well-known actors, the outcome in reviews would have been very different.

To sum it up, ‘Midway’ is a good film, and is fairly entertaining, far better than most of the garbage currently showing at the theaters.  However, the film itself does not have any famous actors, to attract the audience to go see it.  Showing along side the psychotic epic of “Joker” at the theaters, “Midway” would likely flop.  But really, would you want to see a fictional film about a psychotic killer, or would you want to know and learn how the US saved the Pacific, and possibly the world, in about 5 minutes of epic sea battle in 1942?"

If you study history you will like this movie.  The lead in where they discuss tactics from tora tora tora is missing and there are certain segments of the battle which are missing.  The battle is much more entertaining if you explains all the tactics used and the decisions the admirals had to make on the spot.  They should have started the movie after pearl harbor and followed the two pilots that had two hits each, that should have been the movie.  They extended the movie by having pearl harbor and then added even more subplots which weren't relevant.

This critically underrated biography of the country singer may be episodic in its presentation, but does a decent job of informing the uninitiated about its subject. Both Tom Hiddlesone and Elisabeth Olsen give good performances, although I have no idea how accurate they are in depicting the real people. Production values are ok, but the cinematography, whilst possibly aiming for a particular period look, is depressingly desaturated of much colour. Still, Hiddlestone has a credible voice and the scenes at the Grand Ole Opry are shot to good advantage.

The film stars Tom Huddleston portraying the ill fated Hank Williams, the country western icon who brought his style and songs to the mainstream of American popular music with such cross-over hits as ""Your Cheating Heart"", ""Cold Cold Heart"", ""Hey Good Lookin’"", ""Poor Old Calija"" and many many more. Although the film could have delved more into the life of this marvelous singer/songwriter, it gives the audience an overview of his short life and the 6 years in it which brought him to national prominence.
Tom Huddleston, as Mr. Williams, is amazing and the actor’s own singing captures the essence of this immortal performer. Elizabeth Olsen give an outstanding performance as Audrey Williams, the wife that bore him his young son, Bocefus, who country western fans know today as Hank Williams, Jr. This is a story of a life filled with artistic success, ill health  and personal failure as Hiram ""Hank"" Williams strived to attain a place in the world that would give him fame as well as a happy family. Sadly he achieved one but not the other. I give the film a 7.5 rating and whether the viewer is or is not a country music fan, the story of Hank Williams and his place in country music is well worth watching"

.
Good : Samuel Jackson and Ryan Reynolds are the ultimate saving grace of the movie. They play an over exaggerated versions if their public persona, and that meshes with each other very well. SLJ is a complete savage, and Reynolds sells SLJ's savagery very well. They have a very good chemistry with each other. And most part of the movie is them doing these stuff. So, most part of it is very entertaining. Also, even though the material is too clichéd for an action comedy, the director does a very good job of keeping us interested in most of the sequences. Even though we can predict how a particular scene would end, we can get a full enjoyment out of it. Samuel Lawrence Jackson has dropped the mf bomb in many films and guys like me definitely loved it. Here, it's a lot less menacing and doesn't give a vibe of some bad s**t going to happen. But they are too f**king hilarious. This movie has some of the most hilarious uses of the word ""motherf**ker"". .
.
Bad : No matter how entertaining it was, but to the core, it's a simple and clichéd bromantic action comedy. The action sequences often felt like a build up for a joke, i.e., Sam Jac roasting Ryan. The romance feels totally off and the backstory for the romantic conflict is too cheesy. Whenever the supposedly funny part did not have any one of the two lead actors, it wasn't too funny. It tries to take itself too seriously at times, which doesn't feel so good. And most importantly, it absolutely WASTES Gary Oldman. He has got nothing to do in this film, other than showing up occasionally. He is a plain, one dimensional and forgettable villain of a typically clichéd film like this. Oldman wasn't needed for that role. .
.
Conclusion : It's a very entertaining film, with Sam Jac's lines landing perfectly, including every ""motherf**ker"". If you like the actors, you'll enjoy it. If not, it's bad. If the clichéd material is the first thing you notice, it's not gonna be a pleasant experience. .

The comedy action  genre fits perfectly Ryan and Samuel as well. They most certainly have a synergy in this movie, because the scrip is amazingly simple with a perfect humor fit over the story. And as far as I know they also improvised and modified the script so 10/10 for the actors. Also the director's style is really nice and makes the movie fun and entertaining to watch. The Holland vibe is welcomed as well. The plot is very simple, it's basically offered on a plate for everyone to understand, but because it's as simple as this it really has no life lesson, at the end. No message comes over, which is a bad thing in my opinion, because what is a movie if not a piece of art, a piece of expression....well here it's just entertainment sadly. The visual effect are sadly awfully generated CGI, it's even cringy to watch at times. But the SFX and music always helps in keeping the tension. Overall it's a  very good movie, which could have been an amazingly good if the action scene's would have been filmed more stable directing style, with better visuals and with a consistent conclusion at the end of the plot.

1363,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-hitmans-bodyguard/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Davrosdaleks1,"Mar 8, 2018",8,"Yeah, this is the basic story of two opposites forced to go on an action-packed adventure together. However, there is still a surprising amount of entertainment to this. Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson have great chemistry together. Salma Hayek is also a hoot in her limited time. The comedy is surprisingly funny here.

Be forewarned, that the villains are quite serious and deadly. On the one hand, it does make them a serious threat for the protagonists. On the other hand, it feels like you're watching two different movies at points.

Also, Gary Oldman was cast as the villain in a role that was kind of beneath him. Don't get me wrong. He gave it his all, but the villain was at a basic level that it didn't need a grade-A actor."
1364,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-hitmans-bodyguard/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"Feb 4, 2018",7,"Once upon a time two sworn enemies teamed up!

Maybe the critics are right, but like usual, I don't have to agree with them. This is a nice film, not a great film as a few people lauding. It is entertaining. All the stunts were good, comedies were good enough, but the basic plot itself a cliche. Yes, anybody aged 20+ would surely have seen many similar storied films. It's just in another time with another cast and crew. They had promoted it so well. So the result was incredible. But in reality JUST one time watchable film with not expecting serious laughs.

Initially I thought it could be this year's 'The Nice Guys', and they are about to repeat the same magic of Crowe and Gosling duo. But it was different. Too hard hitting, just what Tarantino fans would like to have. Besides, their guy, Samuel L. Jackson is here. Both the leads were good. That does not mean they have saved the film. That's an assumption of fanboys. Luck could be another factor!

It was about a hitman in capture decides to give an important testimony in the International Criminal Court against a powerful man. So now the bad guys are after him in his every move from England to Holland. A demoted bodyguard takes the job to safely get him to his destination. Their journey begins where they are going to encounter a series of obstacles and they finally make it where a major twist comes in before the end.

As I said, this is no special, except the way they have presented on the screen makes the difference. But again, not all films are lucky in that criteria as this one. It is like one in a 20-25 films. So if your objective is timepass, then this will do just fine. There could be a sequel, probably prequel seems a nice idea. But I'm not sure whether I want it or not. I'll just be happy if they do!

Sure, it all degenerates into a flashy lightshow by its final fifth, but the journey is one that's well worth it for fans of spooky movies.

Now after watching it on Netflix I realized that I should never listen to reviews.  I cannot understand why it gathered the hate that it did, I loved it.

Let's get things straight, it is not as good as the original, that one was a classic.  But as a film of it's own right I thought it was great.  I liked the atmosphere the acting was good and there were a couple of times where I was made jump.

As for the negatives, nothing in this film is anything you haven't already seen before in many other films, but this doesn't put me off because I always enjoy films set in a haunted house.  Also the film relies far too much on CGI at the end of the film which comes across as too over the top although still fun to watch.

Maybe I enjoyed  this film more because I went into it expecting it be a total piece of trash, but was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it, I just wish I didn't listen to the reviews and watched it at the cinema.

If you watch this film and don't compare it to the original I am sure you will enjoy it.  Just don't expect it to be better otherwise you will definitely be disappointed!"

This remake uses way to much cgi, it did empress me and it's unique but what made the original fun is it's cheesy old-fashioned 80's special effects I think if this remake could make it similar. Director Gil Kenan's direction is just slick if his visuals were close to Hooper's vision could made it work. Since Sam Raimi produced the film, I thought this movie was going to be gruesome but the movie is bland and if this was ""bloodier"" then it might of been fun to **** acting was good, the cgi was impressive but watch the original series. Positives: the film is scary and it's entertaining, the film was watch able it tries to be a cheesy B+ movie like in the original, but if you have good screenwriters and a proper director this might have been good. Let's talk about the closet what makes that scene good is it is mysterious and does show that under world in this modern remake it does show the world in a good way. The actress Kennedi Clements was good, but she was not good like Heather O'rourke. The characters names are changed? Really.

What I enjoyed most about this flick was the dialogue. There was a very natural flow between the parents and the children. It all felt very genuine not at all cliche in the sense of ""What was that, you're crazy, save my family! we have to defeat the demon!"" The only time the film gets weird in the delivery was once the focus shifted outside of the family but not to worry it only lasts a few minutes and doesn't kill the experience.

Adorable children, appalling teenager and parents reacting accordingly with a supernatural offender(s) bringing them all together.

It is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and the 23rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts, written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Zendaya, Cobie Smulders, Jon Favreau, J. B. Smoove, Jacob Batalon, Martin Starr, Marisa Tomei, and Jake Gyllenhaal. In the film, Parker is recruited by Nick Fury (Jackson) and Mysterio (Gyllenhaal) to face the Elementals while he is on a school trip to Europe.

Discussions for a sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming began by October 2016, and the project was confirmed later that year. Holland, Watts, and the writers were all set to return by the end of 2017. In 2018, Jackson and Gyllenhaal joined the cast as Fury and Mysterio, respectively. Holland revealed the sequel's title ahead of filming, which began that July and took place in England, the Czech Republic, Italy, and the New York metropolitan area. Production wrapped in October 2018. The marketing campaign is one of the most expensive for a film ever and attempted to avoid revealing spoilers for Avengers: Endgame prior to its April 2019 release.

Spider-Man: Far From Home premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre on June 26, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 2, as the last film in Phase Three of the MCU. The film received positive reviews with praise for its humor, action sequences, visuals, and the performances of Holland and Gyllenhaal. It grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the first Spider-Man film to pass the billion-dollar mark, the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2019, and became Sony Pictures' highest-grossing film and the 24th-highest-grossing film of all time. A sequel, Spider-Man: No Way Home, was released in December 2021."

Based on the 2013 reimagining series that ran on Disney XD, ""Max Steel"" is another entry in the ever-growing superhero film market that is currently being dominated by the comic book bigshots Marvel and DC. Max Steel is an admirable attempt at getting another series going, but was ultimately doomed to be DOA due to the fact that it's a more obscure character and clearly just didn't have the flash or history of it's competition. That's not to say it's all bad though. In fact, Max Steel can be quite entertaining. It's just that a reliance on formula holds it back. It's pretty much your standard superhero origin story. You can see bits of Raimi's Spider-Man as Max McGrath plays around with his newly discovered powers, the plot itself is derivative of those two Amazing Spider-Man movies, and the villain feels like he was pulled straight from 2008's Iron Man. It's a hodgepodge of borrowed ideas tied together with the character's own original lore, which I must say is surprisingly well-handled in that you get an answer to all your questions by the end of the film. Further explanation as to the reasoning behind those explanations, like what actually causes Max's weird powers in the first place isn't something the movie gets into. Oh, so he's filled with Tachyon energy. Why? Because aliens? Okay I guess. The writing is just lacking a little something needed to stand up amongst it's very successful peers.

The action scenes in the movie are fine and the characters themselves are pretty likable. Even believable. Particularly Max himself. Ben Winchell does a great job in the lead role. The dialog itself is surprisingly great as well. The interactions between characters feel real right up until some cheesy dialog during the final showdown. It's this kind of stuff that kept me engaged and entertained even though the movie isn't exactly the next great superhero epic. Even Max's personal dramas of loneliness and an absent father are relatable in a way that this year's Power Ranger's movie was. Luckily, this movie is much better in the action department. The humorous dialog from Josh Brener as ""Steel"" is also much appreciated.

Overall, Max Steel isn't as bad as a lot of movie based on toys have been. It by no means soars to new heights, but can at least prove to be a suitable way to pass the time between the next Marvel and DC film if you really find yourself needing your superhero fix. It should come as no surprise though that the real audience for this movie are the kids who enjoyed the Disney XD show.

Most Meta reviewers are Caucasians that think right off the bat think that the film is racist and full of stereotypes, but have no idea what it was like living in the ghetto or the projects in California. From La to Oakland drugs, money, and violence has plagued the streets, but nothing matches to what the cartel or Mexican, Hispanic, Chicano gangs are capable of and this film shows that true darkside of it all. Images that you only could find on bestgore rides through this movie keeping focused on every character especially Shia LaBeouf's. Kreeper is just a straight up sicario and just by watching his character you can feel the natural psycho extert off Shia and realize why Hollywood won't give him roles anymore and its just because he makes it feel too really. The gruesomeness throughout film just reminds you of what Mexico deals with on the regular and could not imagine this happening today in California since it takes place in the ghettos of LA. But the movie did fall short with feeling rushed kind of loosing character development and moving so quick that it felt like you missed so much from the main characters that weren't kreeper. But the film was overall enjoyable and not the worst thing that has been released this year and can find yourself relating to the film if you grew around the a ghetto area because thats the only way you'd figure out if they just straight stereotyped everyone in the film which they did not because the main characters wife works for a large company and is actually the smart one since she handles the accounts or if thats really how they act at times. The film could have been better, but i was glad to see something realistic instead of a special effects film that makes no sense for once. So all and all I recommend this film much more than anything Netflix is making at the moment."

However, if you are a unbeliever, you will either hate it or become a christian, there is no other way around it. The gospel message inside this very will made and performed flick is so powerful that it is impossible to see it with a impartial mind. If you are born again, you will cry tears of joy multiple times, if you hate God, you´re going to hate everything about this movie. It is a landmark in spiritual cinema and should be watched by everyone that knows the Lord."
1436,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/gods-not-dead-2/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MrGreenTurtle,"Apr 25, 2016",9,"is is an encouraging movie. It expresses the faithfulness of God, and the real hope found in the name of our savior. Atheists may not like it, but this is a very good representation of their aggression and anger towards Christians every day. It even goes as far as to prove the existence of the man named Jesus (whether or not someone is willing to believe that he is the son of God is another story). Yet, their responses to our faith are understandable, being as the existence ****, and the right to believe in one stands in the way of their awful agendas.  

Man loves darkness, and therefore his works are evil. Light and darkness cannot truly coexist (one will always try to snuff out the other) and God's Not Dead 2 portrays this concept perfectly. The world's persecution of Christians is only going to get worse as time presses on, and one day soon we are going to be forced to make a very hard choice, very much like the main character: Grace Wesley. Do we stand with God and lose everything - maybe even our lives, that we may have life more abundantly in heaven, or do we abandon him for the fleeting, disintegrating lusts of the flesh? Do we let fear of man overthrow our hearts, or the unconditional love of God fill us with overflowing peace and rest in the face of darkness?  

This movie will remind us that we can trust God even when life gets dark. We stand together as the children of God, born again through Jesus' ultimate sacrifice for our sins and we are part of his kingdom. But we need to press in to Christ and let him present his goodness to us in all things. Ask and we will be given, knock and the doors will be opened to us. If we hunger and thirst in the spirit, we will be filled with the bread of life and given living water. Everything we will ever need (physically & spiritually) will be found through resting in God's love. We need to keep our focus on Jesus, lest we sink in the midst of a storm - for storms are coming. But God's love for us all is unmeasurable and he will never leave, nor forsake us. He is always there right beside us, and that is what I got from God's Not Dead 2.

Final Thoughts: If you are a born again believer, this movie will lift you up! I always find it amusing that whenever a great christian movie is released to the public, a parade of Atheists attack it with a storm of hateful reviews. As Christians, we don't send a renegade of nasty reviews everytime a hollywood classic comes out, simply because it doesn't agree with our bible or line up with our spiritual beliefs. It doesn't bother us because we're looking to the light-and the light completely over powers the darkness. Yet, to those living in the darkness, a movie like God's Not Dead 2 shines so brightly on them, that all they can do is try and push it back. It really just goes to show how real of an enemy we actually deal with.

Atheists don't realize it, but the devil uses them like pawns in an obvious attempt to steer believers away from receiving the messages of true Christian movies. He knows the power and effect that they could have in our hearts or in our lives. Infact, the nasty reviews I saw attatched to the first God's Not Dead was the very reason I almost never watched it at all. But a friend later recommended it to me and my parents even asked if I wanted to watch it with them, so I obliged. And afterwards I felt encouraged and desiring a deeper relationship with Jesus. It was an excellent Christian movie, and the sequel is a powerful addition.

Pay absolutely no attention to a single atheist opinion of this title. Don't let them steal the healing message that God has for you here. At the same time, if you are a christian just looking to be entertained, you may still miss the true point of God's Not Dead 2. But if you are looking for an honest word from the heart of God then I can promise that you will not find disappointment. God bless!"
1437,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/gods-not-dead-2/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TheQuietGamer,"Apr 8, 2016",7,"The first ""God's Not Dead"" tried to uplift Christians and convict nonbelievers. The latter of which it largely failed to do thanks to it's awkward nature and a rather harsh depiction of the very people it tried to minister to. For the sequel that issue has been avoided. This time around the focus is solely on entertaining a Christian audience while delivering a message to said Christians with little to no preaching at nonbelievers. As a result it's a better film in several ways.

That's not to say all of the issues from the previous movie have been fixed. It still suffers from awkward moments, pacing, and writing early on before the actual case takes place. The side-plots do a better job this time around of connecting back to the main conflict, but still feel underdeveloped.

As for the movie's message it's all about standing strong in your faith. The court room drama aspect of the film is all about showing ways to defend our views. It's strategies are defense, but somehow the message is offense. There's a bit of a clash there as the film keeps saying ""we're at war"" and ""we need to fight back,"" but it's constantly playing defense. It's telling us to get ahead of the game, but is having it's characters sit back and wait the fight to come to them. The film has a conflict with it's conflict.

God's Not Dead 2 manages to avoid some of the shortcoming of it's predecessor, but adopts some of it's own along the way. Overall though I can't help but feel that it's a better movie seeing as how it almost solely focuses on entertaining Christians, the only audience who will appreciate it anyway. There is perhaps some pandering at times, but overall this is a movie that built around pleasing it's expected audience. No more, no less.

As a result if you aren't of the faith then I can't recommend it. Especially if you didn't enjoy the first. It's got it's issues and really only Christians are going to put up with them. As a Christian I can say that I enjoyed the new direction and was completely aware that this was built from the ground up to please me. It didn't always succeed, but I enjoyed the overall movie. So for Christians, yeah go watch it. For nonbelievers, this isn't something you'll enjoy in the slightest. At least not without a sense of curiosity, forgiveness, and an open-mind."

1450,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/blumhouses-fantasy-island/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Davrosdaleks1,"Feb 16, 2020",7,"Fantasy Island, based on the 70's TV show, takes the concept of the original, an island where your dreams come true, and adds a dark twist to the proceedings as a group of visitors find their dreams becoming nightmares. I know making a different genre out of a show whose star has faded may seem like an odd choice, but they did make two successful comedies based on 21 Jump Street. Plus the nice thing about working with a property that the newer generation was never familiar with is that you get leeway with creative changes. (Note to self: work on script for Petticoat Junction political thriller.) I don't think this is perfect, but it is an interesting watch.

This actually honors the feel of the original far more than the commercials made me thought it was going to. A good part of the beginning and middle is looking at the characters' fantasies before anything goes crazy. (This PG-13 film is kind of more a dark fantasy than full horror.) All the characters have their personal conflicts and lessons. Each fantasy is distinct and I found them all rather interesting. There were a lot more twist and turns than I'd anticipated.

Though there was a lot I liked about this, it could've been better. It's one of those cases where the director/writers had good ideas and came from a positive place but couldn't reach their full potential. The dialogue is often basic or just weak. The actors aren't able to do much with it. We're talking about a cast with experience too, not a bunch of newbies. Pretty Little Liars' Lucy Hale particularly fumbles and Michael Pena as Mr. Roarke, the one running the island, is hit-and-miss.

A lot of people are downright hating this movie. I think that's bit much. Personally, I think it'so-so at worst. I think it's worth your risk seeing it at some point. It feels a little different than most films."

It's combination of silly sci-fi elements and political thriller plot is what keeps the movie going when cities aren't being reduced to rubble by monstrous weather anomalies. It's predictable for sure and the destruction itself is brought to life by some visuals that are slightly below par (the lightning is outright laughable). Yet, even with it's dopey plotting there's still some suitable entertainment to be found in a turn your brain off sort of way.

Outside **** plot hole the biggest issue with the story is the amount of clichéd family drama. The characters are of the cookie cutter variety and rather than focusing on the more effective form of emotional manipulation by delivering more moments between the main character and his daughter, Geostorm places it's emphasis on the sibling rivalry side of things. Some that is hindered greatly by Jim Sturgess' absolute twerp of a character. He is the definitive boogerhead little brother, complete with bad haircut. The dialog in this film is humorously bad at times. There are moments so stupid that you can't help but have fun with them. Part space adventure and part nature-fueled destruction fest, Geostorm can provide a good time if you can appreciate some cinema trash. It's a Gerard Butler movie for crying out loud. If you were expecting anything more than a dumb popcorn flick then you're an idiot. Only not the kind that will be able to appreciate Geostorm's surprisingly fun combination of the familiar and the ridiculous with a dash of good intentions that's all delivered with a straight face when it needs to be, but has no problem showing off it's silly side (like it had a choice)."

The president of the USA, far-reaching conspiracy, the world in danger, a few good (wo)men doing what is right, impending big disaster – if these keywords fit your cup of B, then „Geostorm“ may have what it takes to entertain you for 109 minutes and leave a good aftertaste.

When the network of satellites designed to control the global climate starts to attack the planet instead, it's a race against the clock to uncover the real threat before a worldwide geostorm wipes out everything and everyone.

Most of the story actually takes place in space, so considerable part of the visual effects budget has been spent to show us the International Space Station, satellites and the big cold void that we like to call the universe. And after having your fill of „cosmos porn“, there are big natural disaster scenes to fall back on.

The disasters dominate the promoting materials but are actually in minority, and mostly mercifully short. They look awesome but are not essential to the story and thus tend to even somewhat disrupt the general atmosphere and flow. Especially near finale, which is mercifully short too. Because good entertainment should always know when to end and not stretch over two hours or something.

Starring Gerard Butler – the unsung hero and go-to guy to any self-respecting B- or generic movie – who is joined by a surprisingly large and impressive cast including Jim Sturgess, Abbie Cornish, Talitha Eliana Bateman, Adepero Oduye, Ed Harris, Andy Garcia, Alexandra Maria Lara, Daniel Wu, Eugenio Derbez, and Amr Waked.

It’s also worth noting that almost all major female characters are written as strong individuals and don’t rely on their looks (although they do look good of course).

This approach is something that freshens and updates the general vibe reminiscent of the big dumb 1990’s movie that the director and co-writer Dean Devlin became really famous for originally, meaning „Independence Day“. Back then, of course, he was just a writer and co-creator with Roland Emmerich, here he debuts as director too.

But cool actors, strong female characters and even big-budget special effects will only get you so far, when the movie is lacking the most essential of elements: heart.

And „Geostorm“ has a lot of heart, which is the main reason I liked and enjoyed it so much – in spite of its weak storytelling where things mainly happen because they are ought to, not develop naturally.

It’s a minor miracle that despite all the unrealistic-ness and cheesiness of the story – it's a B-movie, after all – the actors are so spot on, full of heart and conviction that you just have to buy all this what’s happening on screen.

This is probably thanks to Devlin’s brilliance at putting together this kind of big cheesy thing. It was about time he started directing too!

Leading star Gerard Butler, in some movies just a poor man’s Aaron Eckhart, is in especially good form, a shining example of how to breathe life into otherwise generic material, and grab us along with the ride.

If you think that spouting all these silly lines and making it feel believable must be easy, as it seems for him, then you should try acting for youself.

In a way, his charismatic work here feels as much an achievement as Matthew McConaughey’s in „Interstellar“ which is actually not the weirdest association if one was to compare the central themes of the two movies. But if this comparision seems too out-there, there are also parallels with many apocalyptic blockbusters from „Armageddon“ to „The Day After Tomorrow“.

So… I liked it. „Geostorm“ is certainly cheesy, but it does what it does really well. Go catch this!"

The plot is about taking a satellite system that works well and turning it into something bad for selfish and political reasons. The main characters are cliche and the dialogue is as bad as usual in these types of science films. In this movie, good people do bad things for the greater good. I prefer seeing a bad person doing good to restore my faith in humans. Either way, it’s always intersting to see how to change actions that affect people badly. Our reason to see this movie, despite the critics, was for the imaginative scientific premise. We got what we paid for. Visually, the movie is stunning and still worth seeing with the usual undercurrent of people’s morals and their choices.

Zac Efron is really funny, he has shown that he's got comedic guts over and over again. I am becoming a fan of as I keep on seeing him in these kind of movies .
Robert De Niro is also awesome on the role all throughout. I also really liked the supporting characters, especially Jason Mantzoukas as a drug dealer who had me laughing every time he was on screen.

It is for this reason, that people are staying away from this film, and they are making a big mistake, here's why. At 73, with over one hundred films under his belt, is it really that surprising that Robert De Niro is bored and looking to try something new? In reviewing his credits, he's never been in what one would call a raunchy comedy, and for it what it's worth, he was outstanding. De Niro plays a man who has just lost his wife of fifty year, and is looking to reconnect with his Grandson, and of course get laid. After tricking his Grandson into taking him to Florida, the two wind up at Spring Break in South Beach, where the hilarity begins. De Niro's grandson is played by Zac Efron, who took a while to lose the teen idol label and find his niche as the awkward, but lovable guy in these extreme comedies. Their two characters are so different, that just bringing the personalities together is enough to make things funny, but when you throw them into ridiculous situations together the laughter is off the charts. Personally, I am someone who has found some of the most classic comedies of all time to be a waste of time. Humor is something I enjoy, but not something that I understand easily, and I found Dirty Grandpa to be one of the funniest films, I've ever seen. You will not believe just how raunchy it gets or the lengths De Niro is prepared to go to in order to get some good laughs at his age. I too was thinking this film would be ""okay"" at best, but I was wrong, and so are my fellow critics. Dirty Grandpa is hysterical and those who are avoiding it due to bad reviews and similarities to other films, are really missing out."

1488,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,NightReviews,"Feb 3, 2016",7,"Okay, I know what you all may be thinking, Dirty Grandpa, the newest comedy featuring Robert “Refusing To Take A Pay-Cut” De Niro is just another sad excuse of a comedy featuring a world-class veteran actor whose acting days are numbered and career is slowly fading? Actually, the fact of the matter is, Dirty Grandpa is a very funny, very over-the-top, very rambunctious comedy with nothing but entertainment value, laughs and some good old-fashioned Hollywood fun at the movies, poking redeem fun at itself following the heavy and highly melodramatic Oscar burdened December month.

I can think of so many other disappointing January films that I’ve seen in the past, that quickly make way onto my list of Worst Films of the year. Luckily for **** Kelly (De Niro) and his lawyer loving grandson Jason Kelly (Zac Efron), the two won’t be making their way to that list. Filled with deadpan dirty talk, highly sexualize jokes, crude, rude and obnoxious taboo social references, Dirty Grandpa becomes one wild and dirty-minded fun filled trip to start off 2016.

Not that the film should be a reflection of the film caliber of 2016, but Dirty Grandpa never becomes a film that falls and cannot get back up. Instead, the first comedy of 2016 tells the similar story to Pixar’s Up; but instead of the adorable Carl Fredricksen taking a wild trip on his hot-air balloon, **** Kelly decides that, after a fifteen years abstinence, and with the loving approval of his dying wife, the secret ex-Military man decides to trick his favourite grandson along for a ride to Daytona Beach to find some horny and foul-mouth twenty somethings in a pink Mini Cooper. Kind of the same thing, right?

What begins as a simple guys trip with golfing, dining and some male bonding, quickly turns into a wild weekend looking for answers for both men; sensory for ****, and emotionally for Jason, who is unsure about his marriage to the all too perfect and tremendously overbearing Meredith Goldstein (Julianne Hough), who ultimately becomes the sexiest Bridezilla we have seen on film in a while.

Luckily for our unlikely duo, answers quickly come, in the form of Lenore (Aubrey Plaza); a wild mouth lascivious college girl looking to bone a senior for the sake of completing a life long list of hers; and Shadia (Zoey Deutch), a free-spirited, organic loving, tree-hugging hipster who is the complete opposite of Jason’s Meredith. With the girls off to Daytona Beach, **** begs his grandson Jason to pursue them, knowing that **** is surely going to be able fulfill his dreams of sleeping with a college student. Luckily for the audience, the wildly uncalled for sexual banter between the doe-eyed Plaza and De Niro is what we look forward to the most, making their dialogue the highlight of the film overall. I mean, how funny is it hearing De Niro shout out things like, “Party ’till your pregnant!”, or “I got news for you. That’s the only thing that's going to be pulling out tonight.”(speaking about a pull-out couch).

While the trip to Daytona Beach is anything but smooth, the duo encounter a slew of college obstacles that get in the way of their overall goals of bedding the girls of their dreams; from wild crack smoking Macarena drug-induced trips, to chugging contests, to “Flex-Offs” against dim-witted college jocks Cody and Brah (Jake Picking and Michael Hudson), acting as the duo’s main nemesis throughout the film, Dirty Grandpa is one downright messy, and we love it.

Director Dan Mazer, the man behind writing comedy classic Borat and of course the highly bloated sequel-ish Brüno shortly after, does a decent job of delivering the laughs with a cast that could carry any movie and its comedic material any day of the week. Luckily for Mazer, Dirty Grandpa won’t be a critical hit by any means, but commercially, with a mere $11.5 million dollar budget, the film will likely make a decent marginal profit for the director.

Its rude, its offensive and most of all, the social satire here is totally tasteless, although it is really funny seeing an elderly De Niro asking a group of black street thugs permission of using the derogatory ‘N’ word while singing Ice Cube’s “It Was A Good Day” in a Karaoke bar with his newly made ‘homies’.  Plus, when is a raunchy comedy not offensive? Obviously, if the film and its main **** disturbing protagonist isn’t raising a few eyebrows, something is wrong.

De Niro is Hollywood royalty and can basically do whatever he wants with little to almost no repercussions at this point in his career. So if Robert De Niro, a man who notorious for his contributions to film, The Tribeca Film Festival, New York City culture (including trendy NYC restaurants and hot-spots) wants to do a film where he wears and shows off his prosthetic **** on-screen, hey, Mark Wahlberg did it, why not De Niro?"
1489,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,bttrmovies,"Feb 2, 2016",7,"""Right before his wedding, uptight lawyer Jason (Zac Efron) is tricked into driving his grandfather **** (Robert De Niro), a perverted former Army general, to Florida for spring break."" A movie with the title ""Dirty Grandpa"" can only be a certain type of movie, so you need to keep that in mind going into this. That being said, I can confidently say it's probably dirtier and raunchier than you would expect. I watched the red-band trailer before viewing it, and I was still surprised. I'll say right off the bat, I seem to have the unpopular opinion on this movie right now: I actually enjoyed it.

Let me start with what I liked about the film. With maybe one or two exceptions, I thought the acting in this was fairly good. De Niro really embraces the title role, dropping f-bombs at a rate he hasn't reached since his last Scorsese movie. He's also been an actor that has been known to phone it in from time to time in recent years, and Dirty Grandpa seemed to be a project where he seemed to be having fun playing this over-the-top filthy character. Zac Efron essentially plays the straight man to De Niro, and he does it well. There's one scene where he gets to let loose and it's refreshing to see that he hasn't lost his comedic chops since Neighbors (which he was remarkable in and gets to revisit this year in the upcoming sequel). The standouts, however, are two characters played by Jason Mantzoukas (The League) and Adam Pally (Happy Endings), who are two fairly big names in the alternative comedy scene. I happen to be a big fan of both, and it's nice to see them pop up in more movies that the general public sees. Mantzoukas plays Pam, a drug dealer who owns a merch shop on Daytona Beach, and he's basically a less-gross version of Rafi from The League. Pam is in more of the movie than I expected, which would be annoying had I not liked the character so much. Adam Pally plays Nick, Jason's crazy stoner cousin, who steals every scene he's in. The first few big laughs of the movie come from Nick, and unfortunately he doesn't really pop back up until the third act (save for one small scene over Skype midway through). The writing had some laugh-out-loud jokes that hit really well (at one point, Jason is referred to as a ""Mitt Romney Terminator"" based on his actions). I won't give away too many of the jokes, because some of them come out of left field and are funnier when unexpected.

However, the script is also where I start to get into what I didn't like. If you've seen pretty much any romantic comedy ever made, you know the storyline of this movie. As mentioned in the synopsis, Jason is about to get married to a very high-strung woman (played a bit flamboyantly by Julianne Hough). Very early on during their journey, Jason and **** stop at a diner where a group of twentysomethings are sitting nearby. One of the group members is a girl that had a photography class with Jason in high school (you can probably already tell where it'll go from here). And what you think will happen indeed does happen, which is one of the movie's faults: it's very predictable. As soon as I saw the aforementioned diner scene unfold, I knew the roadmap for the rest of the movie. Also worth noting is that while most of the jokes worked for me some fell flat. Very flat. A few even teeter on being pretty offensive. And that's something you need to know going into this: if you are someone who is easily offended, dear god do NOT see this movie. It pulls no punches, and I can't help but feel it might have been better off it did pull a few.

Dirty Grandpa was one of the lowest-brow, hardest-R comedies I've seen in a long time, and you know what? I laughed my ass off. This is a dumb comedy that knows exactly what it is and who its fans are. Now granted, this certainly isn't for everyone, nor is it even close to a perfect movie. However, I ended up having a fun time with this film and ultimately, isn't that the point of a comedy?"

After seeing the reviews I expected to be cringing throughout this film. Instead it turned out to be really funny. Yes - there are some cheesy parts, some offensive jokes, and some unfunny toilet humor. But those moments are few and far between. For the most part there are A LOT of laughs. Aubrey Plaza is hilarious. And Zac Efron is great for the role - I loved the jokes at his expense."

I have NO IDEA how someone can give this movie a poor score. Carrying that same amazing, haunting, beautiful, touching, moving DNA from 'This is Us', 'Life Itself' is a story that should not be missed.

This movie is beautifully woven, bringing together different stories that, together, tell a tale that is bigger than all its individual parts. Life as the ultimate narrator and all of us as parts of an amazing story that is told through years, generations, through pain and love. First thing I did when I left the theater was to call my mom and tell her how much I love her and how much I appreciate the fact that I have her in my life. This movie has spoken to me and touched me, leaving me in a sore, yet peaceful catharsis.

DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS. Go watch this movie! It will destroy your heart, but I will be worth it in the end, I promise."
1510,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/life-itself-2018/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Trineo99,"Nov 9, 2018",7,"Now the acting in this film was marvelous. Oscar Isaac was the main stand out to me. He could easily switch from a romantic scene to a comedic scene to  finally a depressing scene so well and you really feel for his character. And despite Antonio Banderas’ old age, no offense,  he also did a stellar performance. When I first found out that he was going to be in this film I thought, ‘Oh god no,’ but after  seeing him in the film I now take that back. His character was one that I would love to have as a parent. The final person that I want to give a  shout out to is Olivia Cooke. Her character was one that a lot of teenagers can probably relate to, or at least the ones who  went through  similar/the same experiences/situations like what she did. The humour in this film was definitely directed at  younger people because my friend and I  were laughing a lot when nobody else was, which  can be both a good thing and a bad thing. In addition,  the cinematography was stunning in this film, and each shot had great lighting . The final good thing I want to mention is how well the serious scenes were taken. Some films can’t do serious scenes without making a joke out of it or it being out of place but this film did them so well. This might have come from how the director and writer, Dan Fogelman, also created “This is Us,” so he knows how to do drama. Now for some of the bad things. The pacing in this seemed off, just by a bit. It felt like they would drag on too much of one person's story and then cut it short at some of the others. Now I understand that they probably wanted to keep it short, but maybe a longer movie would have helped it out a bit more. The movie was predictable as well. Sometimes, being predictable is fine but not when you’re trying to make your audience cry. In the end, “Life Itself” really depends on what you look for in a movie. If you like romcoms  then you’ll like this movie, but if you don’t, you’ll probably won’t ."

People keep saying their emotions feel fake; no they do not, and if you still don't buy the authenticity, that would be because they're actors playing characters, not real people. Seriously though Olivia Cooke is BRILLIANT in this same with Oscar Isaac and Antonio Banderas. I get it if this isn't ur thing the philosophical approach this film takes can be overbearing for some people but I thought it made for a well crafted screenplay complemented by gorgeous cinematography and stunningly real characters. A little predictable for sure, but it has a real, beating heart. I'm gonna remember this film for a while."

This story would have been better served by spanning it over several seasons of episodes; there is way way way too much going on.  I'm a staunch sci-fi fan, yet ALL the scifi things just happened/progressed/clicked so quickly; the brilliance of scifi is how people respond and cope and grow (or not) in the face of crisis and change and opportunity and realization.  Because so much was happening and the transitions so blisteringly fast, the human component was likewise skimmed.  I'd watch the same type of film again, though couldn't commend it, and will remain sad that better justice wasn't done to the story, actors, and concepts by giving them a proper format rather than an ultra-abridged movie version."

I know some people seem to dislike the amount of blood and sex but hey, I think they’re just wimps. The sex? Couldn’t care less for BUT at least it was Mads and seemed to serve the greater purpose of murder! I mean sure Duncan survives way more than he should but so what, it’s an action flick who cares. Only drawback was ultimately the lack of story between Duncan and the girl, they could have explored that more and her backstory wasn’t as well done."

1530,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/polar/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Razzz,"Sep 17, 2019",7,"Polar is a fun movie, and it seems to embrace that. I feel the reviewers to the left have never experienced a campy shindig before. Polar follows a style of being campy and fun, for the sake of being campy and fun. This even is used to make a couple of hard-hitting emotional moments in the latter half more impactful. It's fun to watch, even if you have a want for deep themes and artsy moments. It feels semi Noir as we follow Mads Mikkelsen in his quest to try and enjoy retirement but there are people who don't want him to. The sexual scenes really shouldn't put you off unless you're over the age of 60, granted I do agree they were probably didn't need to be there, especially the third one. It makes sense but isnt needed.

But the movie is just fun to watch, it's presented in a very self-aware style, it acknowledges the craziness of its characters and doesn't even try to justify that, it just goes with it. As the film lets you have fun with over the top action sequences, fun and relatable personalities. Great locations and set pieces, great visual effects and editing. The film is bloody and it isn't shy about showing that. Our hero Duncan is a 50-year old hitman, the best of the best and to prove that he has to kill a lot of people but it stays fresh with those fun action sequences. With those comedic moments, with that fun style of writing, not deep edgy lines about how hurt and tragic Duncan is, but rather having Duncan being an unwilling badass for the first part of the movie, but then he's forced to defend his life and the life of others and that's when you really start to connect with Duncan, he was cool and fun to watch at first then he became badass, emotional and relatable. It takes the Logan route (Great Film btw) **** old veteran trying to escape his old life but Polar is fun, exciting and hard-hitting towards the end while Logan is heartwrenching and an amazing story to watch.

Polar won't win awards for it's deep themes or characters with tons of depth, but if you're looking for a fun action film? A film that can laugh with you. A film that will impress you in every way possible? Polar is a great choice, it's nothing to rave over, no reason to rave down to the film store and spend 10$ on but if you're on Netflix definitely atleast try this film. It's 20x better than what it seems, it isn't the pure edgy thriller that it seems. It's fun and makes you emotional towards the end. Even if it's held back slightly by a predictable plot and character moments, it's mindless fun and is at least worth a glance"

If you want to desensitize your kid or a friend to human violence, then this ranks in the top 3. The plot is unremarkable, you've seen it dozens of times before, but the violent antics of Duncan (Mads M) and the Suicide Squad-like kill team are just shocking. Vanessa Hudgens attempts to ditch her cute-ness with a gritty drama role but it works about as well as dressing a kitten in a cowboy hat, still cute, sorry, so that's a casting miss and if you dwell on it too much can ruin the otherwise dark, violent vibe throughout. Kadee Strickland or Dawn Olivieri would've been a FAR better choice. Camille (Vanessa) doesn't have the commitment in the end to do what should be done, so we have the germ of the sequel which would include even more of Vanessa, so no thanks."

Probably not. I don't see why people can't judge it for what it is, an action-packed, violent, light movie.

I knew it would at least be good given that it has Mikkelsen as lead character. And indeed he elevates the movie to the next level. Without him, it would loose the contrasts between dark / gritty and goofy / silly that this movie utilizes to almost create two different dimensions that the characters exist inside.

At the beginning I was a little confused with the flashy characters set on hunting down Vizla. They seemed to exist in a parallel universe with their silly make-up and gumchewing attitudes. But as the movie progressed it started to click for me. It started making sense. Both visually and how the movie uses the ""young spunk"" energy to make Mikkelsen seem out-of-place whenever the two dimensions mixed. Just as he is supposed to be. He's done with that life. He just wants to be left alone.

They should have left him alone.

Interwoven with the hunting is an entirely different story which makes for a good twist. The ending is good, but does make you wonder if a different ending would have been better. I mean, there's so many ways this movie could have ended. They went with a cliffhanger ending I guess. At least somewhat.

Thoroughly entertained throughout."

OVERALL it was an entertaining movie to watch."
1564,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/polar/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,pjonsson,"Jan 28, 2019",8,"This is a bit of a strange movie. Part of it feels like a pretty good, dark and gritty thriller, part of it feels like a wannabe Tarantino movie and part of it feels like a comedy. Overall I would classify it as a B-movie but a pretty good B-movie. As strange as the movie is I have to say that I liked it.

I kind of watched this movie on a whim. It popped up on my Netflix home screen and I kind of liked the blurb. A type of story that I like. Then I saw that Mads Mikkelsen played the lead role and this sold me on it. I quite like Mads Mikkelsen in these kind of roles.

The movie starts off in a fairly normal way for this kind of movie. You know, some assassinations, introduction of the hero, the bad guys, the even badder guys and all that. It is fairly clear already from the start that there will be blood splatter. That it would reach the levels it did towards the end of the movie was a bit of a surprise though.

I did like Mads Mikkelsen in his role as Duncan, the somewhat brooding and grim assassin starting his retirement. But then I’m not really surprised. It’s a perfect role for him. The rest of the actors, well let’s just say that their acting was for the most part forgettable. Maybe with the exception of Matt Lucas as Blut. But then, his role was so comical and wacky so one wonders if it required acting skills or just a good dose of insanity (or some chemical products).

The blurb states that he is deemed a liability. Well, that is not exactly the truth actually. It is more that his overly wacky boss is trying to screw him. This is where it starts to get into comedy land. Already in the first couple of scenes it is clear that this guy is a nut job. Then he let’s loose his assassins and at that point the movie escalates in a orgy of blood, violence and comedy.

I cannot really make up my mind if it would have been a better movie if the violence would have been less comical or not. With the comedy this movie becomes a bit unusual and sticks out. Without it it would risk becoming just another thirteen on a dozen assassin thrillers. Also, as comical as it is, it is fairly well done.

Anyway, there is of course a pretty dramatic and violent fight as the movie draws to a close. I quite liked that one. There is also a little twist that I actually did not see coming at the end.

Overall, it was a fun movie to watch."
1565,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/polar/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DukeTrader,"Jan 28, 2019",8,"This is a very enjoyable film, its dark, funny and violent. don't trust what the critics say most of them have lost the plot and are against Netflix. The only gripe with it is how the film switches from over the top comedy to dark theme makes it feel a little off now and then in the pace of the film."
1566,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/polar/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,cajun67,"Jan 27, 2019",8,"Just a warning, this is a very dark and violent film, but if you're into this sort of action drama, it's very good. Mads Mikkelsen is excellent in this role, and it's worth watching for him, alone.

The first act is too cartoonish, as all of the main characters are introduced with their own title sequence. Honestly, no one cares about that. Most of those names are of no importance to the storyline. The only name you need to know is the main character (Duncan).

But this movie gets progressively better, and finishes with a strong third act.

The critics are really trashing this film, but honestly, I don't see it as all that different from similar films made from ultra-violent graphic novels. Again, this is a genre that either appeals to you or it doesn't."

The movie plays a lot like a comic book. Action sequences with extreme violence are a lot of fun. However the movie has slow scenes in between the action, and this hurts the pace badly. Some of the sex scenes are borderline porn and awkwardly long. It would help to cut twenty minutes or so from it. Vanessa Hudgens is very underutilized, but the rest of the cast works well."

It is truly a great movie about life, choices that we make and, most importantly, choices that we do not, things that happen that you have no control over.
Because those are the ones that will destroy us the most, those are the ones that we will forever think that we could have done something about it.

I watched a lot of movies in my life but I never watched one as great as this one and it makes me so sad that the critics did not get it, because it is truly well made. The world needs to see this and the movie needs to reach a much greater audience. I just happened to see the trailer on Youtube and I am so glad that I did. Those that didn't like it I believe were either shocked and negatively affected by the story and reacted negatively because of it or just didn't pay attention to the story. It is not clear at the beginning what exactly is happening as the director travel through different periods of time of the life of the protagonist. But I assure you that at the end everything will be clear and you will fall in love with the story and its concept behind it.

It has surprises (something that Spielberg probably doesn't know what it is)... and all the cliché beats that you can expect if you see the trailer.

A possibility for the critics not liking this movie is that the protagonist is a white male and nobody else in the movie matters that much and all serve to complete his story... They might be offended by it? Maybe? I don't get it

Because some times you have to do that. And discover that a ""horrible"" movie is not so terrible after all. Sandler bent over backward to create this rather off-the-wall comedy piece, he knew would probably receive slapback. Obviously many critic haters forgot how to laugh. This movie is hysterical, particularly because Sandler cast the right actors in the right roles again, and the script was great. The man still has it, at his age, and he delivered. And I was never much a fan of David Spade, Rob Schneider, or Steve Zahn, but they are awesome players here. As for the ""stereotyping"", are people truly kidding? Look at all the classic Eastwood westerns and some of the Mel Brooks classics like Blazing Saddles, that rocked box offices in the day. Some of them were considered somewhat racial, ethic, or gender stereotype controversial, in spite being popular films. Particularly Brooks with Blazing Saddles, though the movie was a comedy, but quite hilarious. Sandler is Jewish but knows how to laugh, and at himself and his religion, the same as Brooks, who poked fun at religion in History of the World, etc."

The cast were great, and the set pieces were pretty impressive. I laughed on more than a few occasions (the baseball scene and the bank-robbing montage in particular) and I really don't see why everybody thinks it's so racist. Sure, there were a few scenes that might seem kind of offensive, but overall, there wasn't anything as racist as Rob Schneider pretending to be a Native American in ""Bedtime Stories"". Some of the jokes were a bit gross, but there were still more laughs than the average Sandler flick.

Sure the jokes are lowbrow and crude, but the point is what else is doing this type of humor now? Sometimes you just want to chuckle along with the good natured idiots in the film and go along for the ride. By the end you realize that the writing is not half bad and the plot ties itself up nice and tidy. That's more than can be said for some major blockbuster films out there!

Good job Sandler and crew for pulling off what I predict will be a cult classic in several years. It's good to see some of the old faces. Plus there's surprise cameos. Vanilla Ice is actually pretty funny. Just grab a beer, fire up a joint, put grin on your face, expect crude jokes and have fun!

Most of Sandler's movies are comedy.  If you go in and believe that he's out there to insult... that's on you.  People that understand logic thought can tell you that this movie is funny.  People just love to hate Sandler these days because he's not putting out Happy Gilmore quality movies....well hell, that was almost 20 years ago.  Time to let it go and be happy he's still out there making people laugh.  Everyone I know that has watched this film has loved every minute and don't understand where people are getting their panties in a wad.  Face it people... if you don't laugh at this, you don't understand humor.  The 'in your face' jokes, the friends joke, the inside jokes (between actors), genre jokes...list goes on.  there is so much to this movie that all people care about is if it makes a few people... hate this phrase, 'BUTT HURT"" over nonsense.  If you think it's being insulting to the native Indians... what about the being insulting to WHITE PEOPLE for having us use that language towards them?  Oh wait... that's how they use to talk back in the day.  Political Correct people need to shut the hell up and just ENJOY what's out there instead of hating everything because it's 'popular' to do.

I've seen a few reviews about it being a movie  revolving around 6 half brothers, and some WTF moments, and the reviews are not positive. There is little suspense, a shallow plot line and some very questionable acting in places. This is most certainly not Nolan's Dark Knight, nor is it Inception, or Shutter Island.

I am not a fan of Twlight, and to see ""Jacob"" on the screen was not something I looked forward to. In actual fact, I should not have judged so quickly! The Ridiculous 6 played their individual roles well, fulfilling every comedy stereotype to facilitate my roaring laughter!

This, in true Happy Madison this is a feature length film of satire, humor and the story of 6 main characters in a ridiculous situation. We thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and would happily watch it again! Well played Netflix, well played Sandler.

For those who disapprove of the plotline following a group of 6 people in a ridiculous situation, perhaps next time Happy Madison and Netflix could warn you, by titling the movie appropriately. Like calling it the Extraordinary Half Dozen, or the Outrageous Sextuplets, or perhaps the Ridiculous 6?

It's nowhere near the level of ""Jack and Jill"" or that ""That's My Boy"" and closer in quality to ""You Don't Mess With the Zohan"", if not quite ""Happy Gilmore"" level. I thought this was well-shot, decently acted, harmless fun for the most part, and unlike most recent Adam Sandler films, this one actually had something resembling a story, plus his performance as a knife-wielding purveyor of mystical **** is actually kind of badass. The script isn't written by Shakespeare, but it's serviceable and let's be real, we're talking about Sandler here. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the cohesiveness of the story. As one might expect from a Happy Madison production, not all of the jokes hit their targets, but that doesn't mean there aren't some memorable sequences. It was great seeing Harvey Keitel onscreen again. Terry Crews pulls off every reaction shot perfectly, proving his comedy chops, and Taylor Lautner goes all out in portraying the dumb brother with a heart of gold. Rob Schneider has some fun moments, too, though Luke Wilson and Jorge Garcia are somewhat under-utilized. John Turturro's sequence as Abner Doubleday is a standout that points out how the rules of baseball seem totally arbitrary. But it's Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain that steals the show IMO. I would normally give this film a 7 but I'm giving it an 8 to counter-balance all the negative reviews. Seriously, did the people who hated this really find nothing enjoyable at all? The gorgeous cinematography and decent soundtrack? The respectful treatment of the Apache? I'm not a fan of most of Sandler's filmography, but this was not a bad or unwatchable movie by any metrics. In fact I'd say it's something of a return to form for him."
1602,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-ridiculous-6/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,justplainlucas,"Dec 12, 2015",7,"I feel compelled to write a review about Ridiculous 6 just to counter all the negative ones that people are writing lately.  Adam Sandler has been getting routinely lambasted by people who just don't seem to understand that he's not going to change. His form of comedy is still aligned to his fans.  In short, Adam Sandler will be Adam Sandler.

In a social climate where writers are too cautioned to tell any kind of stereotypical joke, Sandler comes in swinging with South Park tenacity.  He may not be as witty as the Stone and Parker combination, but it hardly comes across as racist.  It's too easy to call things racist today, and that word is being flung around too much lately that it's lost all meaning.  The characters are diverse, and everyone gets it, including white people. You won't find many critics ever bringing that part up, either.  The narrative is that this movie is ""racist"" towards Native Americans.

Now, this is far from the best Adam Sandler movie he's made, but it's also far, far from the worst he or his studio has made (Strange Wilderness receives that accolade from me).  It's framed as a Western parody, but it flows like your average Sandler film. A huge cast peppered with Sandler regulars such as David Spade and Rob Schneider deliver silly jokes and slapstick bits. The humor tends to go a little past my threshold for crude humor at times (a donkey with explosive diarrhea for example) but also has some outrageously hilarious moments like a botched hanging of Taylor Lautner.

Speaking of Lautner, he honestly has stolen the spotlight of this film.  He plays a slow-minded but innocent-spirited half brother (of which all six of the Ridiculous 6 are of relation) to Sandler and this is just a career defining moment for him. It's a goofball role that ranks right up there with other actors who've cut loose like Duane Johnson, Justin Timberlake and Brad Pitt.  Honestly, the aforementioned botched hanging was one of the funniest scenes for me.

To be honest, though, there are two points constantly brought up in the negative reviews that I agree with. First point is that Sandler's acting is simply limp.  The character he is trying to for perform just isn't very enthusiastic,  It's not that it's designed to be that way; you can just tell he isn't putting any energy into it.  It's not that bothersome to me, though, because the movie is put on the shoulders of its supporting cast., which again, is quite large.  The second point is that it's about 30 minutes too long.  There are many skits, including a scene with John Turturro and the origin of baseball, that don't really serve the story's progression.  As a result, some scenes lose a bit of comedic impact because they feel like filler.

If you don't like Adam Sandler, you're obviously not going to enjoy this movie.  Good, because it's not made for you.  Instead, this is a pure Sandler film through and through and if you've been a long time Sandler fan, there's little chance you're going to be disappointed by it.  If you're one of those Sandler fans that loved his older work and wished he could return to that era, your only option is to give it a try.  Good news if you're already a Netflix subscriber: it won't cost you a cent more to watch it.  Give it a shot."

This 119 minute masterpiece had be giggling like a small baby that i kidnapped and put in my basement.

1607,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-ridiculous-6/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TheQuietGamer,"Dec 11, 2015",8,"Adam Sandler and Frank Coraci's western send up is just as ridiculous as it's title implies. However it manages to stay thoroughly amusing throughout. Well, provided you enjoy the humor these Happy Madison films usually contain that is. Even with a partnership with Netflix and a western setting, Sandler's latest doesn't break any new ground as far as the humor is concerned.

It's still very much a Sandler film. There are a few bits of extra added vulgarity/raunchiness to some moments, but for the most part it's exactly what you would expect from the actor at this point. That should really tell you all you need to know. If you're a Sandler fan like I am then there is enough here to keep you amused during it's runtime. If you aren't a fan, then just know that there isn't anything here that will change your mind. It's got the same humor that's been a turn off for you for years now.

So as for those of us who still have a taste for the often immature and goofy sense of humor Sandler film's containe, this Netflix original is going to be worth a watch. The cast and cameos will keep you laughing in this entertaining adventure. The setting helps give it an extra dose of energy, allowing for some inventive scenarios. So if you're a fan give it a watch. It's a pretty great comedy. If you aren't a fan, then movie along. This is one movie you aren't going to want to saddle up for. As for me, I personally can't wait to see what Sandler and Netflix are planning next."

I screened this film as part of my research into the representation of sexuality and gender in film, believing that this was a significant work. And it is: the Academy Award for Best Picture winner and one of the most highly rated films on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. Naturally, with all the praise the film was lavished with, I was excited.

When the movie ended I was in a state of confusion. Confusion because when the credits started rolling my first thought was ""Is that it?"". I often like films that are subtle in the way they work and Moonlight is an extremely subtle movie yet at the same time it bears the subtlety of a brick to the face; Moonlight is the equivalent of someone tapping you on the shoulder, punching you and then running away before you have a chance to realise what's happening. The film is too conventional and tries too hard to be experimental with it's simplicity: our protagonist Chiron is met with a number of issues throughout his life which are generic, cliched and frankly uninteresting - people claim that this movie is ""all too real"" but for me it seemed like a shopping list of typical film issues that had all been neatly shoehorned to create the perfect tragic character. The problem I have with this is that a lot of the issues are unresolved by the time the film ends, but perhaps that was the entire point, but then again I stopped caring in the last 10 minutes. You see if you're going to go for a film with deep meaning you have to make one that's actively engaging. (Not that I would consider the film deep, it's more a shallow grave of ideas.)

What bothers me most about the film isn't even regarding the film itself but the reviews. It honestly feels as though this film has been lauded by the masses out of fear that to hold a contrarian view would mark you as either a racist or homophobic. You might read this and think I sound ridiculous but there are existing reviews that criticise this film based purely on its artistic merits, and the people writing those have been attacked for those exact reasons. Heck, I read an article suggesting that Moonlight itself is racist and I'll admit that they brought up some valid arguments.

I've glossed over much of the other elements that went into the making of this film and although you may think I'll criticise them, because I do not like the film, you are wrong. The performances are for the most part fantastic, Mahershala Ali in particular was deserving of his Oscar, the film is well-directed and has some great cinematography, the only problem I have is the screenplay and how forced some of the dialogue is.

So Moonlight was a great disappointment for me. A film I was excited for but one which ultimately failed to meet my expectations. While there are many brilliant things about this film there is simply one thing that is too significant to prevent the film from being anywhere near a masterpiece.

Honestly? They should have let La La Land keep the award."

Once the 3rd act starts, there is a little ""situation"" involving the encounter of two characters. That ""situation"" felt too unreal, & cheap. It's something that just doesn't happen in real life, and felt forced so that these two characters meet each other. That organic feeling from the first two acts just felt destroyed by that 3rd act and made me feel disconnected & angry by a long time.

This is an exceptional film, but only from one perspective and that is, LGBT. I totally respect that, because I'm a big supporter. But apart from that, particularly from the filmmaking aspect I did not like it. I felt like this film took place somewhere in Africa, but the accent was American. Because I could not find a single white or any other race people, even in the background.

The happy parts are, it is surprisingly a very interesting theme. I loved the storyline. The three phases of a man's life. How things around us can influence to build a personality. Sometimes in a good sense, but according to this film, there are some dramatic turns. Though the end was very simple, but I liked the first episode. It had potential to be a message film, but the later parts turned differently. Most importantly realistic narrative.

More like it is about the life cycle. Feels like a short and suburban version of 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring'. All the actors were so good. The screenplay was adapted from a book. Looks like it's a breakthrough for the director. I hope he keeps up the momentum and gives us the best products in the future. This film is not for everyone, mainly because of the theme. Initial parts were okay, but the latter developments were unexpected. It is one of the good films of the year, not the best.

I think the reason it got the attention is only because the subject matter was about a gay black guy.

I get that people might like seeing this subject matter but that doesn't excuse the fact that there's hardly any substance to it.

There are also some good scenes (particularly those involving his ""adopted"" father).  However, the cinematography and direction bear resemblance to the average home movie.  There is also a huge gap in the story between an incident that happens in high school and Chiron as an adult.  What passions does Chiron have other than the fact that he is gay?  What does he even do for a living as an adult?  Most of these characters are stereotypes rather than well-drawn human beings."
1643,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/moonlight-2016/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Nov 12, 2016",6,"Once again I think I fell for the hype and found myself disappointed in a movie when I actually saw it. “Moonlight” is not your ordinary movie in that it tackles the subject ****, Black 9 year old kid/teenager/adult as he goes through discovering who he is. It is not a ‘Gay’ and/or ‘Black’movie meant only for a minority as it gets into the many feelings all human beings go through.

Chiron (Alex Hibbart as the 9 year old, Ashton Sanders, the teenager and Trevante Rhodes as the adult) goes from being an alienated, bullied boy to a muscled drug dealer who nobody fools with and in a way has followed the path of his mentor and surrogate father, Juan (Mahershala Ali), who taught the kid how to swim and discover himself.

We also meet his friend Kevin (played at the three same stages as Chiron by Jadin Piner, Jharrel Jerome and Andre Holland), his mother (Naomie Harris) and Juan’s girlfriend (Janelle Monae) who offers Chiron a place to stay whenever he needs one.

Chiron, as many gay kids, of any color, becomes a loner, is beaten up by schoolmates and accepts whatever kindness he receives. It was interesting following his path and where it goes. The scene in the diner is a love story unto itself though nothing is said about love except for a record playing on the jukebox.

The film failed me in that certain sections the jargon, vernacular, made it difficult for me to hear what was being said though I understood what was being done just as I didn’t quite understand the relationship between Juan and Chiron and how it became about and took the turn it did. Also a few very interesting characters just disappear from the film. I wasn’t aware the N word was used so much between Blacks as it is here at a certain level.

All 3 actors playing Chiron are outstanding as is the oldest Kevin. The arch of Chiron’s life holds your interest though at times moves too slowly. Ali’s Juan is an imposing figure and the two women, Harris and Monae, especially the former are strong in their portrayals. The direction and screenplay by Barry Jenkins, based on his life, tackles a rarely told story in the movies but it is also about loneliness and trying to answer the question “Who am I?”  Some scenes are held too long, others don’t finish the thoughts being expressed. There are two powerful scenes I don’t think I will forget though they may go over the heads of others.

I do recommend “Moonlight” but don’t go in with high expectations as I did and approach it as going to see a good film with a new story."

There were numerous better films made in 2019, Joker, 1917, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, First Man....Even whatever Marvel movie came out this year was likely more interesting and memorable. This is not the years best picture, at all, it most likely won the award because the director is ""Diverse"", much like the sycophancy surrounding Black Panther. The hype is similarly political.

The last half of the film drags. Well filmed and acted, it is nonetheless at its core a vastly overrated movie.

It tells the story of two families whose fates and directions intersect and become interwined in a series of plot twists and turns that sometimes boggle the ability of the viewer to enjoy the film. This is a movie that just can’t seem to make up its mind…is it a comedy…or is it a tragedy…or is it both. Also confusing and somewhat annoying are the English titles that seem to clash against and appear inconsistent with the words being spoken by the actors. At a minimum this recurring inconsistency between the titles and the spoken words became for this writer, at least,  a major distraction.

Rarely have I seen a film receive such unwarranted and undeserving praise and accolade by the critics who I can’t believe saw the same movie I did. I found the scenes in the film to be drawn out and the movie itself to be unnecessarily long, again the penalty for having the writer/director charged with editing (or failing to edit) his own work product.

Las actuaciones no se me hacen la gran cosa, la historia se me hace como un capitulo alargado de la rosa de Guadalupe pero de mayor presupuesto, tiene escenas incomodas e innecesariamente estupidas como en la cual la pareja sexual de la protagonista empieza a hacer una especie de arte marcial completamente desnudo y otra donde detienen un incendio. Ademas de que se siente demasiado lenta y con muchas escenas sin chiste.
Ha sido una de las pocas peliculas que estuve de punto de dejar de ver de lo mala que se me hizo, ademas pienso que la calificacion de la critica esta realmente inflada y solo apoyada porque el director es de renombre, al igual la nota de los usuarios se me hace muy alta.
Sin duda esta fue la pelicula mas sobrevalorada de su respectivo año de estreno.

Single shot scenes contain so much that is so real, they place you squarely in Mexico City in 1971 next to the director himself. What's missing is character depth. Does Cleo have dreams or regrets? Could she love that young man? Is she aware that women like her are second class citizens, a fact we in the audience are constantly reminded of. Cleo was Cuarón's housemaid in his youth, and she is written as such. He clearly loved her, and still appreciates her to this day -- but he didn't really know her."

The movie would have you believe that many people live this kind of life, and that most can get away with living a sloppy and ambitionless life without consequences but, in the dice game of life, Affleck takes a stupid gamble and rolls snake eyes.  He becomes a haunted and angry individual who moves to Boston and ekes out a living as a janitor.  Several years later, his older brother dies and names Affleck the guardian of his high-school age son.  This could have been a movie about redemption.  (It’s the obvious ending choice, and you will find yourself hoping for it, rooting for it.)  Instead, you get a cautionary tale about broken people. Those who like this movie use a lot of adjectives to describe it like: ""heartbreaking, genuine and powerful.""  It is all those things but, it’s also a movie without hope. The ending is sudden and abrupt like a cold slap in the face, a lump of coal in your Christmas stocking, or discovering the Grinch in your living room instead of Santa Claus. If you're looking for holiday cheer, you might want to go see something else."

The acting is generally very good. Michelle Williams sticks out as the real star although Casey Affleck seems to be getting all the hype. Affleck is a great fit for the role. However, he plays the exact same role he plays in all of his movies which makes me wonder about his actual acting capabilities. It's perfect for this movie though. I am concerned that Casey Affleck is like Klaus Kinski or Woody Allen who only can play themselves.
The movie is well shot and has a profound story that's well written. The movie would have been better if it had taken itself a little bit less serious and been sped up a little bit at times, especially in the first half."

I loved the cinematography - the acting was extraordinary but I found the storyline over the top and kind of overblown melodrama. what brought him to get so drunk? how did he survive the unsurvivable? I felt like they just kept adding reasons to not like Lee (Casey Affleck) while feeling sympathetic to the two ex-wives. I feel like they just wanted to create a Job-like character when in fact he is more of a self-destructive character. What brought him to drink and do drugs? Also - although I love the music overall - the placement of the sound on one speaker over whelmed the dialog and the emotions of the scenes. Anyway - great job by the actors - not so thrilled with the director or the writer's job. Sorry - I left the theater feeling as if I was taken advantaged of.

Since the main character and the teenaged nephew who has the main secondary role are not immediately sympathetic characters, the film needs to keep the filmgoers interested with the plot and the personal growth of the characters.  Unfortunately, Casey Affleck never really experiences any personal growth, and ends the film the same as he started.  Matthew Broderick is totally wasted in a cameo role.  The scenery is beautiful, but the film is way too slow moving."
1701,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/manchester-by-the-sea/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Dec 2, 2016",4,"""Manchester by the Sea"" asks how do you survive an unimaginable tragedy?? People handle it in different ways and Lee (Casey Affleck) becomes a totally cold, uncaring person who cuts himself off from all those he loves, leaves his hometown, gets a job as a janitor in Boston, drinks a lot of beer and has fights in bars.

The first hour of the film deals with Lee before and after the tragedy, how he was a happy man, father, husband, brother and friend before he became the loner he is now. After his brother, Joe, (Kyle Chandler) dies, he comes home to find out that Joe has appointed Lee the guardian of his 16 year old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges) who in many ways is a typical teenager but is acting out upon the death of his father. At this point the director/screenwriter, Kenneth Lonergan, tells us what the tragedy was and it is almost to painful for the audience to hear and watch. For the next hour and 17 minutes we see how uncle and nephew interact and deal with life, Patrick with humor and sarcasm, Lee without emotions and staying as uninvolved as he can stay. We meet Patrick's mother Elise (Gretchen Mol) who has been out of his life for years, her new husband Jefferey (Matthew Broderick) Lee's ex-business partner and friend George (C. J. Wilson) but most important of all Lee's ex-wife, Randi (Michelle Williams).

While Affleck is getting all the attention in the reviews I was more impressed with 20 year old Lucas Hedges as the 16 year old who can break your heart and a second later having you laugh. Affleck does a strong job especially since most of his scenes have to be done in a monotone, showing no emotion and fighting the pull his nephew on has him as a human being.

Michelle Williams has a very emotional scene, lasting about 5 minutes, with Casey Affleck but as easily as I am moved in a movie's emotionally scenes, this didn't move me.

Gretchen Mol is wasted and Matthew Broderick has a very thankless part. The rest of the supporting players including  Patrick's main girlfriend played by Anna Baryshnikov are all above par.

I love heavy, family, movie dramas but the bottom line is that ""Manchester by the Sea"" is way too long by 15-20 minutes which doesn't make for very much tension and though the scenery of Manchester by the Sea is excellent in all the seasons and there is no fault with the acting I don't recommend it.

Oh, yes, a very distracting soundtrack that more than once takes you out of the story."

Some very beautiful shots & imagery in this movie. I loved the opening on the boat, gave a sense of raw realism. There were some moments I enjoyed for sure... but they were too far and few between.

This revelation, which was brought to light by a team of reporters from a daily sports journal of all things, led to the dissolution of the government and a probing look into the nation's hospital network, exposing system-wide corruption that had been in place long before the catalytic event that spurred this inquiry. ""Collective"" relates the unfolding of these events through unprecedented access to the journalists and reformers who sought to expose a system where patient care was secondary to the self-serving interests of politically connected administrators and their crooked affiliates. However, while director Alexander Nanau's impressive and authentic documentary is indeed a remarkable piece of investigative journalism, its raw footage approach to the presentation of its material is often dry and talky, failing to stoke the kind of outraged emotional response that a work like this should handily accomplish. It thus plays more like a radio report on film than an engaging cinematic presentation, diluting much of the impact that its findings should generate. Sadly, the victims of this tragedy truly deserve more, not only from the government that let them down, but also from the vehicle through which their story was told."
1713,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/carol/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,rmurray847,"Aug 10, 2023",5,"I'm a big fan of Cate Blanchett, and have loved her in almost everything she does. Her ability to make a low-key character as credible as a high-energy character. Or to make a working class woman as believable as a wealthy and powerful women. She's great in pretty much anything, and I've bought movies knowing nothing about them except that they starred Cate Blanchett.

I don't care for her too much in CAROL, and in fact, I don't care much for the film. I can accept a film that is quiet, where passions are banked and never allowed to burst into full flame (or at least, not often). But I don't actually want to be lulled to sleep by the film. But there are long stretches that are infuriating because they are a) slow paced & b) there doesn't really seem to be anything happening in the inner-lives of the characters either. CAROL takes the concept of meaningful glances or the exchange of smoldering looks to a degree where sometimes it feels that this is all the film is really about.

Blanchett plays a bored wife (Carol) of a well-to-do man (Kyle Chandler) who is under something resembling occasional house-arrest for a ""romance"" she had with an old female friend (Sarah Paulsen). Essentially, she had an affair, one exacerbated by the fact that it took place with a woman (oh, did I mention, this is the early '50s). On one of her rare trips ""into the city"", Carol shops in the toy department of a big department store, and exchanges glances with the shopgirl (Rooney Mara) who helps her decide on a gift for her daughter. The scene clearly must mean something, because it goes on for a long time. Yet I never felt any passion stirring or smoldering or any HEAT. But Mara is clearly stricken by Blanchett, and when she realizes the lady has left a personal item behind on accident, she sends it back to Carol, and this small kindness leads to Mara spending more and more time with Carol. Apparently, they have the hots for each other, but we sure don't see it for the LOOONGEST time!

I get **** the '50s, feelings of desire for the same-sex were, shall we say, frowned upon and needed to be kept carefully hidden. But CAROL fumbles because it takes so much time avoiding anything coming to the surface even when the two women are alone together. Mara's character is conceived as a bit of a simpleton (in my mind). I suppose she's supposed to be naive and that these feelings are new to her (except they aren't, as we find out in scenes with her friendly but oblivious boyfriend). She seems somewhat out of touch with her own feelings. And occasionally she sounds like she's **** speech slurs and her articulated thoughts meander.

But Blanchett is the biggest miss here. I would have expected those relentlessly silent scenes, or the ones where characters talk about one thing when clearly they're thinking of something else, to have had more impact thanks to her ability to convey her inner life so well. She's done it before (NOTES ON A SCANDAL jumps to mind). But here she seems nearly vacuous. She seems to be striving towards a sensuousness that she's having to keep **** she certainly keeps it hidden (I feel bad bashing her so much, but in my opinion, she is just simply not that good here.)

The movie essentially follows the development of their relationship and also shows its impact on the lives of the men who love them. The ending is actually interesting and in some ways a bit surprising and unexpected. It might even have been stirring if only we cared one bit about these two characters.

So why do I even give the film as many as 3 stars. Well, first of all, the production & costume design is impeccable. The toy department in which Mara works is a nostalgic delight (I wasn't alive then, but it just felt so completely RIGHT). Mara, despite my overall dislike of her character, has moments that are quite nice. The final 20 minutes or so of the film finally kick into a bit of a higher gear (thank goodness) and rescue it from complete forgetability.

I know that this film just racked up some Oscar nominations, including for Blanchett. So clearly I am not in the majority regarding this film. But when a film is about PASSION, whether on open display or carefully hidden, I still need to feel that passion, either because it's openly represented, or clearly building beneath the surface. Instead, I'm left to infer what these characters are feeling, and if I don't care about them much, I'm not willing to make that kind of effort or investment. When the film was over, my wife and I discussed the film for **** were both in agreement that it was not great, and so our discussion was about why the film was held in such high acclaim. We never settled on a definitive answer, because this is so subjective to start with. But in the end, I have to stick with my gut feelings...CAROL just doesn't work."
1714,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/carol/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,kino_avantgarde,"Dec 8, 2022",5,"It is a film that is neither deep enough to be praised nor shallow enough to deserve unfair knocking. While the presence of Cate Blanchett adds value to the film, she shows a bit too much in the foreground, which reduces the depth I believe.

It has been stated that smoking is used as an element of nonverbal communication rather than a masculine symbol. Carol smokes when she is self-confident or she wants to impress someone else. Likewise when she is very tense and distressed. Yet not when she is very happy, calm and content; eg in the car, restaurant, motel / hotel. It is observed that she did not smokes for a long time until she had to return home.

Maybe the book is more impressive, so the movie may have fallen short of expectations. However, for a movie that made such a big impact (77 wins & 255 nomination), it could have been so much better in my opinion."

I wish Anthony Minghella or Sydney Pollack were alive to direct this. The movie had very good art direction and little else going for it. There was little to no chemistry between leads. Sarah Paulson and Ellen Page should've been in the leads as they really are lesbian. And like others have said, there was little to know about Rooney's character so how would Carol even love her so immediately, let alone love her over Paulson's more interesting character? The movie was TOO slow. The music was a little too intrusive at times, though mostly beautiful. And the script needed a lot more subtext; especially for that era. I'm going to have to watch The Talented Mr. Ripley again just to wash the mediocre taste out of my mouth from this. Matt's a lot more convincing as gay than Rooney was in Carol."

1719,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/carol/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Jan 9, 2016",5,"""""Carol"" is an excellent movie with one major negative aspect and two minor quibbles but more about those later. There is no finding fault with the cast as Cate Blanchett a wealthy married woman seeking a divorce from her husband Kyle Chandler. Blanchett  has previously had an affair with Sarah Paulson, a school friend, and is now embarking on an affair with young, not rich, department store clerk, Rooney Mara. The latter is going with a dapper, rich, sort of snobbish boy played by Jake Lacey, though it is Blanchette who buys her the expensive camera she needs to further her pursuit of a career as a photographer. There is also John Magaro a poor, nice guy who works at the New York Times who might be able to help Mara get a job there but he also has feelings for her. Along with the minor figures in ""Carol"" each and every performer gives their best and in the case of Blanchett, Mara and Chandler that is high praise indeed.

The director Todd Haynes, the screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, the perfect production design by Judy Becker, the camera work by Ed Lachman along with the costumes by Sandy Powell and the period music by Carter Burwell bring us a perfect picture of the early 1950s. Not only do we see the right cars like Blanchette's Packard and her full length creamy mink coat but the streets of New York, the Oak Room of the Plaza hotel but even more important the morality of that time regarding homosexuality and the blackmail that can ensue even from people who love you. Though wealth and class levels are brought forward they are done in subtle ways still getting the message across.

There is nothing salacious or predatory about the older woman/younger woman really drifting into an affair with the older woman being who she is and the younger woman finding out who she is. Blanchett and Mara are completely believable in this journey they are taking together.

Now we come to the negative aspect and the quibbles mentioning the latter first. It is very perplexing considering her love for her child that Blanchett would allow her child to be driven by Chandler who is drunk. Another 'driving' incident is that though we know they are wealth there is never any hint, suggestion, showing that they have a chauffeur though we do see the other household staff and yet in another scene we see Chandler stepping into the rear of a car and being driven away. Petty? Quibbling? Possibly but this is part of the negative aspect that found my very disappointing in ""Carol"". I am a **** for a love story, whether it be between opposite or same sex couples, and yet, in spite of their top rate performances, and even their non-threatening sex scene, I felt nothing for this couple. I didn't, couldn't, find myself rooting for them.

It is because of this feeling, this lack of being emotionally involved with what was going on in the film I find myself in a very small minority and would only recommend ""Carol"" if you have a 'thing' for the early 1950s!"

I couldn't see a successful future going forward nor a terrible shame if it didn't work out. Actually, I'm assuming that it didn't work out, that each got bored or restricted by the obvious mis-match, turning the story into a pretty pedestrian life event.

Great acting, great filming. Minor characters were merely one-dimensional devices.

Disappointed that it wasn't a bit more socially poignant, as I felt that the societal context was underdone.

It's really beautifully made and on the whole is well performed, but there is a fundamental flaw…there is no chemistry between the two leads. I didn't buy into the relationship at all, it felt unrealistic and the film failed to fully show any real spark of romance.

I applaud the idea to feature a lesbian romantic story and the most interest for me lay in the forbidden nature of that kind of relationship in that period. Its period detail did seem to drip off the screen and it has some really well crafted scenes, I especially liked the last scene.

But, for me, because the relationship lacked chemistry I found myself left cold, even bored at times hence why I started noticing the period detail rather than being lost in the romantic story. I wasn't the only one to think this, my girlfriend felt the same as did some others who were in the cinema I overheard as we left.

Half the viewers of this movie only watched it for Harry. His acting was so funny, and somehow has gotten worse. Honestly at some point I wish HE had jumped off the boat, but I guess I am glad he survived. If he died, we wouldn't hear his outstanding British voice talking so seriously. Imagine the spit coming out of his mouth. He was scathing. Poor Gibson. The movie was a colossal waste of time, only worth it to laugh. In all honesty, I've forgotten any other scene of this film, it's just Harry. And not even because he's good, because he's bad. Should stick to singing."

It doesn't worth the time you spend on it and that's the starting point for me for any movie. Many other war films give a better idea of what war world 2 was."
1739,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dunkirk/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Mahmus,"Sep 25, 2020",6,"In my opinion, one of Christopher Nolan's biggest weakneses has always been his characters.
Dunkirk ""fixes"" this problem by almost completely eliminating the concept of characters, but it does come with big downsides.

On the one hand, it lets Nolan focus on what he's best at: the technicals.

The cinematography is stunning, the editing and direction are pretty good (althought the constantly changing aspect ratio is very distracting).
And the music is, once again, Hans Zimmer pressing his whole arm on the keyboard.

On the other hand, not having any real character makes many scenes feel like they drag for way too long and makes for a very dull experience.

If we knew something about any of these people maybe it would have been different.

Overall, it's not a terrible movie, but a very unmemorable one.
Like most Nolan movies, it's technically impressive.

The lack of characterization makes it more bearable for me than something like Interstellar,
but it does negatively impact what could have been a very compelling drama, instead of just a series of well shot battle sequences."
1740,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dunkirk/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,zNeverSleeping,"Sep 17, 2020",6,"Tecnicamente impecável, mas o que é além disso?

Essa obra me causou uma pequena confusão mental. Por um lado, eu estava impressionado. A fotografia do filme é um tão impactante quanto um diamante refletido. A técnica de alternar as proporções funciona muito bem aqui, mesmo que seja mais aparente na Smart TV. A trilha sonora se encontra muito presente, o que pra mim é um ponto positivo. O cenário é absolutamente lindo, seja em alto mar, na terra ou no ar. O elenco tá bem definido, mesmo que o mesmo não tenha um peso muito grande aqui. Enfim, assistir essa obra em 4k HDR é uma experiencia unica.

O roteiro do filme está em outro nível. A compreensão de Nolan quanto a técnica narrativa vai além do esperado, e aqui, mais uma vez, ele prova isso e brinca com a linha do tempo para nos entregar uma experiencia mais impactante. O clímax, onde as três storylines se encontram é muito bem feita e conduzida. Porém, nem tudo são flores.

Apesar da minha agradável concepção aos aspectos técnicos, o filme não parece ter uma alma. Meu envolvimento emocional foi zero. O desenvolvimento dos personagens acontece, mas simplesmente não é o suficiente para criar uma ligação entre os mesmos e o publico. A trilha sonora passa a sensação de que mil e uma coisas estão acontecendo, ou que há algo grandioso para acontecer,  o problema é que essa tensão soa forçada, pois nada a altura da OST acontece, e você fica se perguntando ""porque???""

O cenário, apesar de lindo, não aparenta ser de um filme de guerra. Os soldados não parecem cansados, e toda aquela situação não aprece tão ruim quanto o filme tenta nos enfiar ""goela abaixo"". Para uma total imersão, decidi rever o filme no fone de ouvido, sem legendas e com o áudio original. Porem eu não contava com uma trilha sonora tão alta. Na maioria das vezes, principalmente se tratando de compositores talentosos como Hans Zimmer, isso não me chateia, mas aqui todos os personagens fazem um esforço ENORME pra... sussurrar. Não sou fluente na língua inglesa, porém a dificuldade que tive pra entender as falas foi fora do normal. O filme já conta com poucas linhas de dialogo, e quando há, eu não as entendo.

No final das contas, assisti o filme mais uma vez, priorizando o máximo a imersão e qualidade  do mesmo, mas ainda assim não fui capaz de dizer o que essa historia veio para contar.

Edit: Depois de me esforçar muito, consegui entender o porque muitas pessoas amaram o filme. A atmosfera criada pelo Nolan é, talvez, inovadora. O vazio, a falta proposital de emoção, expressividade ou até personalidade provam o ponto niilista do filme. Eu fiquei um pouco confuso, pois a OST tecla muito no drama, que ao meu ver, não existe sem pre-requisitos. Porém, eu consigo sim compreender o porque esse filme é autentico em alguns aspectos, e isso merece sim seu reconhecimento - mesmo eu não tendo entrado no filme.

However, this film has a big problem: it does not take off.
Dunkirk shows some characters that end up importing almost nothing or nothing directly; you feel a very good template of actors totally wasted because of the null narrative of this film."
1746,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dunkirk/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Axelskull,"Dec 4, 2018",4,I wouldn't really call this a film but I'd say it was an interesting experience. The story follows a few characters that are completely forgettable and they each have their own little storylines that are also forgettable. I watched this in IMAX and the sound and photography were great and very immersive. For the first 20 minutes. Then the gunshots and noise just hurt your ears. I'd say unless you're watching it in imax don't bother with it.
1747,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dunkirk/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Broyax,"Aug 11, 2018",4,"Le meilleur film de Christopher Nolan, techniquement parlant : il tient bien ses caméras, ne les secoue pas et le montage n'est pas saucissonné ; les plans sont en outre judicieusement choisis... Cerise sur le gâteau, le film n'est pas long comme un jour sans pain -contrairement aux Batmous par exemple- et va droit à l'essentiel : bref, on ne s'ennuie pas !

Le spectacle est là et indéniablement impressionnant, sur terre, sur mer et dans les airs... les images de synthèse sont assez belles mais loin d'être irréprochables, les zingues notamment ont l'air de jouets en plastique. On s'étonne par ailleurs de voir -de façon fugace certes- un front de mer très contemporain... de notre temps : les ordis étaient-ils en panne ?

Le fait de découper le récit sur 3 axes -terre, air, mer- est une bonne idée pour le rythme mais se fait au détriment de l'humain, surtout lorsqu'on a en tête l'excellent Week-end à Zuydcoote d'Henri Verneuil mais bien sûr l'approche n'est pas du tout la même, ni les intentions... On a ici à peine le temps de reconnaître les quelques gugusses, trimbalés comme des fétus de paille qui ne se parlent pas ou si peu. Faut dire qu'on a pas le temps de faire la causette, c'est la déroute... mais tout de même.

Et puis, il y a pas mal de détails qui fâchent et font tache ; le petit con qui se cogne la tête et qui clamse, c'est n'importe quoi ; la RAF qui dégomme la Luftwaffe comme à la foire... en fait, trois **** Spitfire qui font le ménage à eux tout seuls ! dont l'un arrive à voler sans essence pendant 10 minutes... sans compter l'autre qui amerrit tranquillou ! et la marmotte, Môssieur Nolan, elle emballe le chocolat dans le papier alu ?

Et puis, on peut déplorer la musique agitée de Hans Zimmer, pas au mieux de sa forme : les trois quarts du temps discordante, cacophonique puis qui singe Vangelis à la fin. Et un petit côté gloriole pas très marqué mais bien présent comme si Dunkerque n'était pas la pire défaite de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale au cours de laquelle une armée s'est fait massacrer tandis que l'autre se carapatait à toute blinde dans la panique et la confusion.

Donc, Dunkerque -ou plutôt Dunkirk pour messieurs les Anglais- ce n'est pas mauvais pour autant mais ça reste étonnamment médiocre et superficiel. Pour une idée de la débâcle, allez passer un Week-end à Zuydcoote, car malgré tout son argent, ce Triple A fanfaron est à mille lieues de la puissance du film français."

They were really just jumping from scene to scene on different events going on and didn't seem like the movie was really going anywhere. The acting was pretty good for the most part but the dialogue was the issue. Certain times in the movie there would be scenes where it had you on the edge of your seat so it was exciting in some parts."

I expected a much more entertaining experience.  Instead, I got more of a docudrama, showing the politics and horrors of war.  It was, however, enlightening as to what went on at Dunkirk, which many Americans are unaware.
The director constantly used time changes which confused the viewer throughout, Not until I was more than half way through did I start realizing what he was doing.  Characters were not well developed, and there was little plot, other than reenactment of actions during that battle, and the horrors the soldiers endured.  I came away knowing more about what happened at Dunkirk, but felt depressed and unentertained.  “Saving Private Ryan” it is not."

It feels very slow and long, with long intervals with no dialogue. When people did speak, it was sometimes hard to understand what they were saying. The movie has long, anti-climatic dog fights that feel really boring. It has several long intervals where nothing happens. The music is really good, but often is more intense than the scene the music is playing in. All in all, not as good as people make it sound."

The other half is the constant use of the thumping soundtrack at all times. I liked the sound at first. An hour and a half in I had to take a break because the mental strain of the constant thumping noise was really bad. Like “Do I even want to subject myself to this monotonous soul **** noise?” bad. The other half of the problem is this is the most sterile war movie ever. No blood could have worked. No blood, dirt, facial hair, emotion, or any imperfections of any sort did not. It’s like watching a documentary accept it’s acctually cleaner than any documentary I have ever seen. It’s like they made war into an art exhibit it’s so clean. So overall I loved the airplane scenes and the amount of men and extras and the sense of scale was seriously mind blowing. If your someone who can’t stand really annoying sounds or someone who doesn’t like the idea of a WW2 as an art exhibit this movie isn’t for you."

Pro:
The sense of desolation on the beach is decently represented.

Con:
The scale of the evacuation never hit home, 1000 ships participated, and some 84 allied aircraft were lost. I got no sense of scale from the movie, except troops on the beach.
Lack of character depth and development
Poor aircraft CGI (patchy, there are scenes where Hurricanes are shown banking perfectly together, which ripped me out of the immersion)
Strangely, no sense of urgency around anything that happened."

His movie are always excellent. Batman Begins, Dark Knight, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar are just some of the masterpieces he's crafted over the years. And I was pretty hyped for his next film. Not to mention the legendary Hans Zimmer doing the soundtrack. But I was very disappointed with Dunkirk. The opening was excellent though, but after that first 15-20 minutes I got mind-numbingly bored. The dialogue and drama was boring, the directing was pretty boring, and worst of all, the action scenes were boring. I can hardly believe this was directed by Nolan, it feels like he was just being lazy during writing and filming. And Hans Zimmer's soundtrack couldn't rescue this falling creation either. His tracks in Man of Steel, Inception, Interstellar, and The Dark Knight are all exemplary. But once again, I felt like Zimmer just completely dropped the ball, aside from one good track. I did not like Dunkirk. Feel free to disagree, but this was my honest opinion. I watched The Prestige about a month after this, and that film was light years ahead of this average film making."

Brilliant movie making for sure, but the fractured time, the three stories and the intense in-your-face of it makes it feel more like a rollercoaster ride than a complete narrative. There is a certain hopefulness of it, but no real end as far as I was concerned. Unbelievably awesome tour-de-force movie making, especially with those huge iMax cameras - I wish I had come out with a better sense of things rather than a sense that I'd been thrown into the middle of a horrifying engulfing war experience."

To begin with, you have no character development at all, all characters are just like ants, meaningless. The scope of the movie is supposed to be about an army of 400 000 men, stranded in a city and how they were rescued. The highest number of men you ever see in one scene is perhaps one thousand, and that's a view of the entire beach. And what are they doing? Just standing in line waiting for boats to arrive. So instead of an epic saga, what you'll get is basically an old fisherman and his kid sailing on the English channel, two fighter pilots flying around in the air and a dozen random soldiers doing nothing. You see three-four airplanes in the air (in total, throughout the entire movie) and you get to see perhaps two destroyers. Other than that there's about one hundred fishing ships. This movie might be worth the watch if you have nothing else to do, but it definitely does not hold up to the hype. It's a mediocre movie at best!"

Baffled by how Michael Bay or Terrance Malick are liable for being criticised for the exact things for which this movie is being praised for. Namely a beautifully shot, but completely asinine and poorly constructed cure for insomnia.

There is no plot, there is little character and no development, the action scenes are poorly edited and paced, and the sound design for much of the film leaves the audio difficult to understand or become invested in. These are all criticism that could be levelled at the aforementioned filmmakers - that the framing and audio are unintelligible - but here it is scene as ""daring"" or ""minimalistic"".

Ultimately, it's worst crime is being too boring, for me at least, to suspend my disbelief. Save your money."
1775,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dunkirk/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Righter,"Aug 6, 2017",4,"When compared to some great classic war movies, Dunkirk is both mediocre and unnecessary. Nolan, it seems, can't forget that Memento is what initially made him, and uses a time-shifting device that is both unnecessary to the drama and gimmicky to the point of tediousness. To make matters worse he deliberately dispenses with one word (""ago"") that would have made viewers enjoy the time-shift instead of spending some time confused by it and trying to work out how it works. Add to that the ridiculous liberties he takes with history and it's clear he's pandering to British Jingoism and little else. Dunkirk ignores a few key historical facts; that the French kept the British soldiers alive, that the British, in return, didn't help the French evacuate their own soldiers, and that the only reason the evacuation of Dunkirk could take place was because **** (for his own reasons) specifically gave an order that stopped the Germans from attacking the allies in Dunkirk when he could quite easily have wiped out the soldiers stuck there. Even apart from all those issues, the movie is simply overhyped and lacks the scope that the buzz and the trailer would have you believe it has. To see the movie, you'd think the soldiers amounted to no more than a few thousand (and in most scenes, barely a few hundred). The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer (who is, by now, infamous for his music plagiarism) is also incredibly overrated and relies mostly on the 'Shepard Tone' audio illusion to create a false sense of tension and drama. Dunkirk is white, British, and pretentious and to top it all off, ends with Churchill's famous ""We will never surrender"" speech, which, by now, we're all tiresomely familiar with - once again glorifying a man who referred to Palestinians as 'dogs', and who allowed the bombing of Coventry, and who also had no issues bombing and destroying the civilian city of Dresden."

There's defo moments which will have you buzzing, and it does capture a certain Britishness which I loved (the tea factor is awesome). But ultimately there's not really enough for you to invest in to be as moved as you should be. Plus it Hollywood-ifies it too much in parts, with OTT events constantly happening to one bloke and everyone thinking ""well he's invulnerable""

And the music is annoying as hell music. Strings keep a two chord progression motif constantly running, as well as a single pitch note hanging constantly in a poor attempt to build tension. You feel more relief when the cavelry arrive that the music changes rather than that they've saved the day.

Also, Nolan just drags out some scenes way, WAY too much, and often mistakes building tension for building boredom."

As far as the movie goes, if you go into this movie not knowing much about Dunkirk, you'll leave the movie not knowing much more. They really should have had strategy scenes in **** HQ talking about the strategy to trap the British soldiers. And then strategy scenes in Churchill's HQ on how they would attempt to save them. Maybe show some map scenes demonstrating what was happening. Oh well."

They carried it off, and there was enough suspense, as revelations came, to keep me patient with the very slow pace. Two questions, though: Why couldn't we have some dialogue between Kate and her female friend, re: what she's learned about Geoff's past? It actually felt a bit strange that she didn't bring it up with her, and the missed opportunity seemed like a case of underwriting.

Also, the choice of a song to open & close the film: Who on earth would choose ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" at their wedding, or anniversary celebration? Do you listen to the lyrics? Again, it was implausible and/or lazy, in my opinion: It fits at the end, but come on!"

To feel it completely, each movement and action of the characters must be held up to this light. I cannot dislike the movie as it was so genuine and uniquely reaches climax in the final seconds. I did however feel it could've used more of a revelation. There were so many chances to reach the heartbeat of the human condition, but decides instead to leave us feeling the way it's characters are: on the outside looking in."

Okay, I'm American, there are countries in the world (China) where the person you marry is expected to be pure (a virgin.)  So the woman character finds out her husband's old girlfriend might have been pretty serious, or not, and she's bent out of shape.  YIKES! that was 55 years ago and the girlfriend died in an accident.  Get over it.  So the story line is hard to accept, but the acting, superb.  Her facial expressions and body language, she doesn't have to speak lines.  She should have won the Oscar."

It's a very well-acted picture, but with the skillful acting in the service of a slim story premised on the idea that a woman (Charlotte Rampling) could be married to a man (Tom Courtney) for 45 years without ever sensing that he had had a previous love. This seems naive. Furthermore, although the embers are obviously dimmed in old age, you don't get the sense that this relationship was ever so romantic that it would have blinded the woman to the husband's secret for very long. Theirs has been a marriage of companionship and mutual comfort, not passion; without passion, there is no plausibility for her failure of perception. It was only when Rampling surreptitiously viewed some decades-old slides of the young woman taken before her tragic death that I personally felt any sense of dramatic involvement with the movie. The earthy, sensual face that stares out at us in those photographs, Rampling's diametrical opposite in every way, was very well-chosen; and in those moments you do get the sense that she would have been a much better match for Courtney….. But in general I found thin reasons here to justify the near-cosmic rating."

Then Geoff receives a letter: the body of his pre-Kate lover, killed in a climbing accident, has been found in melting ice (making this the first climate-change domestic drama?).  This discovery brings memories of twenty-something passion and optimism into a house imbued with sixty-something acceptance, and the resulting trainwreck grows more interesting and affecting the farther it grinds along the rails.  Takes a while to get there, though, or seems to, despite the film’s 95-minute length.  Rampling is outstanding, and nowhere more than in the film’s masterful last scene. P.S. If you want to read a pro review of this movie, I suggest A. A. Dowd of the A.V. Club, who is one of several pointing out the ghost-story-like character of this film."

The movie is basically about the couple's reaction to this news.  Both Courtenay and Rampling give naturalistic perrmances, but the film is very slow moving.  Charlotte Rampling never really discusses her discoveries or her feelings with her husband, so the audience does get the anticipated payoff.  Somehow  there doesn't seem to be enough plot for a full length movie, and I was frankly bored."

The week before, a letter arrives that stirs up emotions from his past and brings the sincerity of their marriage into question. Rampling has received an Oscar nom for her underplayed performance, but it’s the entire movie that’s reserved and unsentimental. We watch them mundanely go about their daily interactions with a deliberate pace. Nothing about the film is especially affected or emotional. There are quiet observations and lots of her looking (into mirrors, fields, waterways). I found it tasteful and Rampling lovely, but the underplayed drama and objective direction made me impatient and underwhelmed."

This movie is very watchable and brings a new element to Scorsese’s gangster films in being more of an autumnal look back from the vantage of old age. Now the negatives. DeNiro and Pacino are miscast. Frank Sheehan and Jimmy Hoffa were of Irish heritage. The likes of Liam Neeson would have been more appropriate as Sheehan. The middle section is repetitive and concentrating on Hoffa so much throws the movie off balance. Pacino in a bad hairpiece chewing the scenery doesn’t help. Bringing in the Kennedys etc has Scorsese treading into James Ellroy’s Underworld Trilogy territory. The female characters in the movie are afterthoughts. The pace is plodding and I didn’t know gangsters talked so much.

And as hard as they tried you can't hide the fact that our favorite actors are old. You can cover their faces with CGI but you can't de age their movement and body language.

In fact, it feels nearly as if I'm watching all his films in one. Sadly, the story follows a path that many have seen before. The visuals also contain a lack of ambition, showing a style that has since gone stale. It could be fun for a newbie, but not for a Scorsese fan."

The thing I kept thinking most while watching Scorsese's new 10 lbs slowburner in a 5 lb wet bag, was 'how can the critics be giving this perfect scores. Did someone pay them off?'  We've seen much better in the same style coming from Marty. And as shoulderoforion mentioned, the CGI young faces just aren't working for the film.  Especially with De Niro.  Al Pacino really shines in this.  Giving a performance that I feel the rest of the cast just couldn't muster up. It's disjointed and longwinded and these are not adjectives I'd normally use for a Scorsese picture. This isn't going to be a popular sentence, but I really feel like this was a bit of a cheap shot. You don't really have any reason to care for most of the characters but Pesci & Pacino.  Even Ray Romano gave a more ""there"" performance than Bobby.  I would say watch it, and will even give it a 6 just for the big save by Pacino (but that's only a fraction of the film), and Joe Pesci's about-face to stoic, rather than his usual Goodfellas/Casino loud mouthing lovable weasel.  The Irishman works on an odd recipe that is missing so much proverbial seasoning that you get from Goodfellas, Casino, the Departed and even Mean Streets despite it's coldness and preliminary nature in the grander picture of Marty films.  Watch The Irishman.  Definitely. Contort your, face puzzled at the blatant CGI. Take breaks out of boredom.... it's all worth it to see Pacino bring real sentiment to the table, and sell the role so well. That's the best thing I can say about Irishman. Pacino rocked the role of Hoffa. And the rest is all quite forgettable and at times cringeworthy with the de-aging CGI. 6 out of 10."

Here's Scorsese longing for the Goodfella glory days and using the same cast to try to recapture it.  This is no Goodfellas. It's derivative. It's badly edited. It's boring. And worst of all, the movie keeps interrupting itself with captions under various characters that say things like:  ""Shot in the head in his driveway, July, 1980."" These ridiculous captions take you out of the movie. It's 3 1/2 hours long, fercryingoutloud. It gets interesting in the 3rd hour, but it'll take a 2 1/2 hour slog to get you there."

I'm under the impression that this is also a rather accurate historical movie with most respects, the attention to detail is also impressive.
My only problem with the movie is that the middle drags on with very little happening apart from creating scene after scene of cliched mob dialogue, someone said something about you, oh did he well you tell him I said blah blah atc, and to be honest if it was split up and you put those scenes into other mob movies they would be great, but it's just a tab monotonous and loses its impact when you get the feeling that the mob is a little bit like mean girls.

I don't get why this film got so praise. The fact that it is so many legendary actors in this film is awesome, no doubt but it dosen't make it a good movie. The story however, is quite confusing because how De Niro tells it. While you watching this movie, like everyone said, is that it is very easy to get bored thanks for it's film's pacing.

I enjoyed the last hour or so, but the first hour in particular was a real slog to get through and I actually watched the film in 3 sittings, not due to time restraints, purely as I became too bored to continue twice. The casting of Combo from This Is England (I forget his name, some scouser) was dreadful, his attempt at the accent - I think it was New Jersey or similar, is absolutely dreadful and really stands out, easily the worst part of the film for me and he ruined every scene he was in. The real travesty in the film was the anti-aging used, it simply doesn't work. It's OK making De Niro look 50 again, but when he moves like an old man it's unintentionally hilarious, a scene where he beats someone up had me in stitches, you could blatantly tell it was an old man doing it, with some silly Toy Story style cgi making his face look younger. Of course you get the standard Rolling Stones song thrown in as per usual as well, I'm not sure if the director is unaware it's a parody now how he crowbars the same damn tune into every film he makes or he's in on the joke. I've given it a 6/10 as like I said, I enjoyed the last hour, and Joe Pesci is fantastic in it, it's really a shame he doesn't act anymore and I've really missed him the past two decades. Pacino however, well he's the same old hammy, shouty, over-acting self and it's clear why Scorsese hadn't worked with him previously - the guy can't act, and De Niro is De Niro, the man has one style no matter what role he's taking and his constant sniffing and breathing in only gets worse now he's ancient. All in all though, it's clearly a vanity project by Scorsese, and a last chance for him to get all his doddery old fart friends together before they all start dying. I'm baffled how this film is being lauded so highly, it's very mundane and in parts will make you almost fall asleep, De Niros performance is phoned in, Pacino is as awful as ever, the CGI is immersion breaking, when Gimme Shelter comes on AGAIN in a MS film you'll either laugh or roll your eyes, the Scouser playing an American stands out like a sore thumb and it's at least an hour too long. The only redeeming feature is the excellent Joe Pesci. If not for him appearing, and a decent last hour then I don't think I'd rate it any higher than a 4. It's clear to see why this ended up on Netflix, it's simply not good enough for a theatre release and people would have either walked out through sheer boredom, or fallen asleep. It'll be a real shame if this ends up being the last Scorsese film, or the last time you see Pesci and De Niro together as quite frankly, the film is dogsh**."

If you have seen The Departed, or Casino, or Goodfellas, or Mean Streets, then you have also seen The Irishman. The idea of using the fancy schmancy de-aging tech doesn't do anything for the shambling story. Yes you see the de-aged face of De Niro, but he still dodders around the set like a 75 year old man with a very thick torso. Honestly though, the de-aging tech didn't quite work, it ruined the lighting on the characters during most of the scenes, making them pop out of like video game characters. The plot is exactly what you expect. I kinda just wanted to watch The Sopranos again, and 70 episodes of The Sopranos would feel shorter than this 3.5 hour slog.

Also, shame on this film. There are no real women characters, just paper thin wives and daughters who show up to look lovingly/skeptically at the crime boys. Do you all know that despite what TV/movies show, women are actually integral parts of society and stories?"

I didn't care one whit about anyone on screen or anything that was happening... yet somehow, despite the length, I remained engaged.  I'm hard pressed to think of a film with so much talent, made with such a high level of craft and artistry, made about people I had no investment in.  It was odd.  The only reason I cared at all wasn't b/c I had a relationship with the characters, but with the actors, the filmmaker and the genre.  The film is intrinsically bound to its pedigree and that makes it interesting to anyone who has watched these careers unfold over lifetimes... But it doesn't make it inherently a good movie."

My initial viewing impressed me, earning the film four and a half stars out of five. However, this second viewing was a different experience, prompting me to revise my rating downward.

On re-watching, the jeopardy and stakes in the film felt significantly more contrived. The tension and plot twists that initially thoroughly engaged me now seemed forced and predictable. Additionally, the characters, both human and emotional, were much less likeable this time around. Some, like Joy and Sadness, which I once found endearing, came across as annoying.

Overall, while Inside Out remains a beautifully animated film with a creative concept, its charm diminished significantly on a second viewing. My excitement for the sequel is now more tempered, hoping it can recapture the magic that seems to have faded from the original."

""Inside Out"" was decent, but nothing spectacular. It was somewhat overwritten and somewhat over-produced. Plus, it was too talky and a little too sophisticated for young kids. Pixar has had a few nice features. Their animation is outstanding, But for the most part they are a little overrated. Their story lines are just so-so. Brave, Up, Cars, Cars 2, Monsters University, Ratatouille, were all too slow for kids (and for a lot of adults). Heck, to be honest, I've NEVER been blown away by any of Pixar's features.

1848,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/inside-out-2015/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Spazzh20,"Aug 11, 2015",5,"Here we go again, another Pixar movie that relies on over the top archetypes instead of characters and has no originality whatsoever. This should be fun.

You know I grew up with Pixar back in the late 1990’s and let me tell you the kid in me wants to like them but the objective critic in me can’t stand them. The last film they made that I thoroughly enjoyed was Up and that came out back in 2009. They’re like Activision and Call of Duty now, it’s the same thing every time.

Also If you check their wikipedia page then You will see that they haven’t got anything new planned for the next 3 years. Finding Dory, Toy Story 4, Cars 3. (Wasn't the second one bad enough.)

Why not give their franchises to another animation studio to make an animated series based on these movies like Buzz lightyear of star command instead of constantly going back to the the things that we’ve all seen before. Don’t get me wrong as long as the movie is good that’s all that matters in the end. Even though Call Of Duty is the same game every year at least it’s fun. (Though Ghosts was a big disappointment)

But it seems like Pixar is trying too hard to attract a crowd of new kids without even thinking about the kids that loved them back in the 90’s. I mean Toy Story 3 was essentially Toy Story 2 again just in a different coat.

Open up the movie with a large scale action sequence that is later revealed to be a figment of someone’s imagination, introduce the idea that toys don’t last forever, There is a misunderstanding in which the toy(s) are mistakenly put in a position where the unwanted toys are supposed to be, The toys get placed in new environments meeting new characters, one of them being a jolly plump toy who wields a cane. this toy is later revealed to be an antagonist fueled by the traumatization of being abandoned by their former owner taking his anger out on others, The seemingly good hearted toy convinces the other toys to stay with promises of being loved for generations, A delusional factory setting Buzz lightyear locks up the Protagonist(s) , the protagonists enter a large scale industrial contraption where the antagonists is disposed of and left in the care of another person. That is the plot for both Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3.

And now as if that wasn’t bad enough since Toy Story is so popular Pixar seems to think that all of their franchises should be like Toy Story. Lets take their new movie Inside Out for example. If I were to tell you that there was a Pixar character who all the other characters only exist to look out for their well being but at the same time they’re not aware of their sentience, the entire plot is affected by them moving to a different city, they also have to deal with growing up and leaving their childhood in the past, who am I talking about? I’m talking about Andy from Toy Story right? I’m also talking about Riley from Inside Out, because when you think about it they’re the exact same person.

Now if it were just the unoriginal characters I could over look this film. Unfortunately there are a lot of other things wrong with this movie. The main human character  Riley doesn’t get anywhere near enough screen time. The whole movie revolves around what a person would be like if they were limited to the amount of emotions they had, but other than not getting along well with her parents we don’t get to see much of her personality. We don’t even get to know much about the people in her environment. There was one point in the film where she starts crying in class and is embarrassed that the cool kids saw her cry. I was thinking that this would make for some great social interaction but we never see them again. The movie isn’t a complete dud though, it shows that even negative emotions have their place and reason for being. It kind of reminded me about a game called Sonic Shuffle. At first everyone is angry at the antagonist Void for making people dream negative thoughts but at the end it is revealed that negative emotions give people strength and that people need to feel all sorts of  emotions in order to truly experience all that life has to offer.

When all's said and done I can recommend this movie as a time waster, something for you to take your kids to. But If you are looking for something deep and meaningful then go watch something else. Overall Score 5/10"

It's also not a feel good movie either.. Infact it's out and out emotastic.  I hope this makes a ton of money because i don't like Disney inhouse beating Pixar, which has been true since Tangled. If Pixar carry on making weepies then they are gonna have to do a lot of catching up. Come on Pixar!  I take my kid out to have a good time!  Which reminds me... Inside Out is a talkie, probably contains the most dialogue out of any Pixar movie, probably why my daughter was bored. It really didnt feel like the movie was for kids at all.  As it stands...

The problems that both my wife I felt were that this movie never had a real message or theme.  All the great Pixar movies had a theme and message that could be summed up in a single sentence.  Unfortunately Inside Out doesn't.  Amy Pohler as Joy is the exact same character she was on Parks and Req.  Sadness was so annoying that I felt like anger early on.

I mean the whole theme of the movie is that a memory can be both joy and sorrow.  Yawn.  Finally, the relationship of the parents to the girl is very lacking.  The parents ""need"" her to be supportive of the move and problems.  She must show happiness and be supportive.  Then in the end the parents finally realize that maybe the kid was sad about the move.  Are parents that stupid?

There were some great parts.  Loved showing other people's minds and their control centers.  Too bad the movie couldn't have focused on this instead of the story it picked."

It had moments of being too juvenile and it may have been for a younger audience, but I'm only 14 and I know that most teens will have gone to see this movie, also parents. As for the characters, I found Joy and Sadness to annoying. At times I wanted to claw my face out because sadness was borderline depressed and joy just needed to understand that you can't have the spotlight. It should have explored the islands more, which doesn't actually count as a spoiler cause it is featured in the trailer. Overall I just found it disappointing, especially for a Disney movie.

Beautifully shot, evocative of a lazy, lovestruck summer month in the gorgeous Italian countryside, it's a thoughtful, peaceful slice of bittersweet romance if not a terribly active one.

Strangely edited, we'll cut away in the middle of a conversation but linger for long stretches of scenery and minor character actions. That does effectively convey the boy's listlessness, his adolescent ennui within a magnificent family estate, but it also leads to major pacing problems. Though it runs just over two hours, I caught myself glancing at the clock after one. Our two leads, Elio (the boy) and Oliver (the intern), share the flicker of chemistry, but initially flirt with so much nuance and subtext that I thought I'd missed something when it came time for their inevitable heart-to-heart.

The climax is excellent, with a charged, open-hearted monologue from Elio's father and an unforgettable close-up during the credits, but by that point I was more than ready to check out. Long, tedious, occasionally rewarding and very, very art house."

So beautifully crafted in every way that it survives its near-fatal flaw. When Stanley Kubrick's Nabokov-based ""Lolita"" came out in 1962, it was advertised as the erotic adventure of a ""seductive"" teen who you too (men) would not be able to resist. Now in 2018, just as we're buttressing our  protections for children as well as adults from sexual exploitation, comes this romantic, exquisitely nuanced art, ""Call Me By Your Name"", that happens to repeat the horrible example of ""Lolita"". Seventeen year old Elio and his father's colleague, Oliver, fall in love. When Oliver leaves, both are heart-broken. Nearly every review I've read mentions ""coltish"" Elio's  intellectual maturity and emotional vulnerability. Remarkably, his cosmopolitan parents and social network are a model of insight, empathy, discretion, and support. They will help Elio turn his horrible loss into new strengths. The directing, cinematography, and acting that beautifully bring these nuances together is so effective that many viewers will suspend their boundary on man-boy sex.  In spite of our better judgement, some critics and many viewers become willing to believe a youth can seduce an adult; that the adult is not a culpable perpetrator.

Technicalities of statutory **** aside, it's the developmental difference between a young Central Nervous System and a mature CNS that makes Oliver's relationship with Elio such a high risk for harm. We viewers and reviewers have a responsibility to remind the artists we rightly respect that romanticizing, even brilliantly, man-boy love contributes to sexual exploitation of anyone.  ""Lolita"" at its ending exposes the sexual exploitation of the teen as horrifically destructive. Frances McDormand says to her Priest in ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"", ""...you join the club, Father, you share responsibility"". As art is how the culture talks about itself, I believe she was talking to us about ""Call Me By Your Name"".

Call Me By Your Name

Closing the half-open fridge door after someone left it or snatching water bottle out of someone's hands or a locket are some of the finest detailed props used to convey a message which of course ups the ante of the film within it first few minutes. Call Me By Your Name is soothing, light and hopeful film about a relationship within a brief period of time and it is shot within it stretching it over for more than 2 hours, seems a bit much even from an adopted novel. Timothy is brilliant in it and his breakdowns (surprisingly there are few of them) are amazing and his love track is portrayed with such an innocence that it might remind you of Jake and Heath from the Brokeback Mountain. Call Me By Your Name is a movie that feeds more of the character to the audience and sometimes stretches the sequences leading into exhaustion and if it was edited a bit more; it might have been perfect."

It was nicely done, but for me, it was way too long and a case of too much information at times.  Loved Armie Hammer and Timothy.  Both did a wonderful job.  But, for me, it was not a great film.  I think about 30 minjtes could have been cut without damaging the story."

It is somewhat deceitful and to a certain extent a bit false and Armie Hammer's acting doesn't feel in the right place.

And it goes without saying that this is not a love story, let's be honest what the two characters shared was nothing but passion, especially if you take into consideration the age of Timothée Chalamet's character, who evidently had his hormones at full throttle.

I respect the opinion of anyone who has enjoyed this movie, but for me it felt very empty."

A stilted, trite screenplay full of unconvincing and un-naturalistic dialogue might be compelling if it were the voice of the 17-year-old central character.  But as written by James Ivory, Elio is a passive observer.  The unlikeable, closeted characters exploit the women in their lives.  The abrasive music clashes with the stunning camerawork and handsome locations.  This would be better as a silent film.  Read the novel."

First record: it has more nominations than any other I am aware of.
Second record: I do not recall a movie that I would be so bored watching.

Placed into a beautiful Italian scenery, this film is a love story between  a 17-year-old young man Elio who is still trying to find himself sexually and otherwise and an older young man Oliver who is a graduate student of Elio's father and comes to visit them in Italy.

The end of the movie was powerful but by that time I was waiting for it to end already.

Music sounded intrusive and somehow did not fit with either the mood of a situation or scenery.

Not without great moments, the film is just way too slow and too long. Performance-wise, Timothee' Chalamet who plays Elio did a good job for the most part.

Overall, the movie left me cold, I did not feel any empathy. There are many ""gay love"" movies that I liked much more, so the subject is not an issue for me but it is not an advantage either (like for sooo many critics).

How else can I describe it? Too sweet yet it's not sugar but artificial sweetener."

With a script characterized by bloated, stilted, implausible dialogue and a narrative that's been done countless times before, there's precious little about this annoying slog that we haven't already seen many, many times previously. Save for one particularly touching scene toward the film's close that helps to redeem much of what precedes it, ""Call Me By Your Name"" fails to live up to its potential - or its hype."
1880,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/call-me-by-your-name/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,markopolous,"Dec 21, 2017",6,". I felt no real chemistry between Armie Hammer’s Oliver and Timothee Chalamet’s Elio. And that’s in spite of a wicked good performance from Chalemet, who is so completely open-hearted and vulnerable in this performance, if not technically perfect. Truly, one of the best performances I’ve seen by a young man ever. But it’s stranded in a film with a director who doesn’t know how to convey the passion between these two young men (or can’t, due to contractual obligations). I consistently felt that the camera was in the wrong place and that the pacing was wrong too. Somehow, this adaptation managed to feel boring and drawn out, while also rushing through all of the important moments. I don’t think Guadanigno really got into the head of his characters, particularly Chalamet, considering the book is really driven by the intensity of his wavering teenage emotions. It really just didn’t feel organic for me, which is too bad because I truly wanted to love this movie. Yet, I left feeling little emotion, with many of the film’s moments completely vanishing from my memory as I walked out of the theater. Even the film’s last scene, with a heart wrenching performance by Chalamet, seems more like an image I remember out of context than an emotion I feel in my heart."

I enjoyed a few episodes but not the movie as a whole. It felt like director-writer's own experience which I am not sure was true. Performance-wise I liked Scarlet's and Laura Dern's but not as much Adam Driver's. His singing was better than his playing but I don't think it was his fault.

The fact that it left tears and smiles on the audience's face at the end explains why he is so identified with the audience.

However, if there is one thing to remember, it is the difference between successful and quality film. In addition, success is subjective, quality (technical) objective data; It would be more rational to compare from this point of view.

Whether la la land is a ""dreamland"" as depicted in the movie, or just a fake paradise, the decision is yours. I only respect the ones which touches my brain, not necessarily or only my heart."

1903,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-la-land/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,ClariseSamuels,"Sep 18, 2018",6,"Film musicals have a long and venerable history in Hollywood, although we see less of them now in this age of skepticism when viewers are slightly less inclined to be seduced by the magic and the illusion of the big screen. Films based on Marvel Comics, which now rule the industry, have succeeded in resurrecting some of that old wizardry that makes the audience forget themselves as they plunge into a make-believe world. Trying to make a magical musical in the twenty-first century that references the classics of the 40’s and 50’s is a risky business, but La-La Land has succeeded in charming its audiences with its song, dance and simple love story of two young people with a dream. Nevertheless, translating what is basically a stagecraft into a musical film is difficult. The forced artificiality of breaking out into song and dance (the phenomenon known as “I feel a song coming on”) is born of the architecture and design of stage and theatre, which is artificial in and of itself. Suspension of disbelief is required for performances limited by the spatial dimensions of the stage, but with live theatre, we are prepared for this practiced tradition of Western civilization going back to ancient Greece (although props and scenery were not invented until after 1600, and the position of scenic designer did not evolve until the 1920’s).


The risk of too much theatrical artificiality is a lurking threat behind this film, but it is to some extent salvaged by the performances of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Their singing voices are so-so but they dazzle when they dance, and Gosling cuts an eloquent profile at any piano. He is the perfect picture of the artist as a young man—romantic, angry, frustrated, a loner who is misunderstood even by the one woman who loves him. From the moment the characters of Mia and Sebastian meet, setbacks,  misunderstandings and financial concerns delay and frustrate their relationship until finally it fails. At the end of the film, a fantasy sequence replaying their entire romantic history in an idyllic version of how things might have been is a poetic testament to the harsh realities of life and how it interferes with the hopes and dreams of the individual. For the most part, the two lovers both achieve what they wished for, but the personal price was high. The poignant, old-fashioned nostalgia of the film is enhanced by the musical score, most especially the haunting refrains of the song “City of Stars,” sung by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling."
1904,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-la-land/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,manusbyrne,"Apr 7, 2018",4,"La La land is a musical that does not have good songs or a good story. The story follows a women who dream to be an actress but just can't get a movie role and a man who want to open a bar that plays jazz music. the story is not creative or interesting it is just so cliched.
the film doesn't know what tone it wants to go for. From the advertising and the trailers, you would think that this was going to be a happy musical but no it's a drama and not a good one. Despite of it being a drama most of the song in the movie is a very happy tone and once the songs are over the movie instantly goes back into a drama. Because of this the songs of the movie feel out of place. Not to say that the song is not good. They are actually very good, City of stars is the best song in the hole film it's well written and it's the only song in the hole film that fits in with the tone of the film.
So what about the drama if that is the main focus of the film. well, it's not only bad but it's stooped. The characters are always going back and forward of happy song and serious drama which just ruins the drama.
This film would just be alright if the ending was not terrible. does not make sense for the characters to do what they did at the end and nothing else makes sense about it.
that's why I give this a 4 out of 10"

And frankly, I just don't get what the hype was all about.

The story is a somewhat muddled tale of a struggling actress and a jazz musician who fall in love, though they struggle to keep things together as they chase their dreams. Now, a plain story like this can usually be dressed up in a musical with flashy singing and dancing - neither of which are present here. The songs are repetitive, as it turns out that listening to the exact same chord progression repeated for two hours can become a bit tedious; and Stone and Gosling's ""singing-in-the-shower"" warbles certainly didn't dazzle this viewer. In fact, their restrained musical performances are an embarassment to the resplendant costumes and sets that surround them.

What's worst, however, is that its potential did shine through. There are two or three dramatic scenes between Stone and Gosling that are so well written and brilliantly acted, they genuinely show up the mediocrity of the rest. It's not a bad film, by any standards, just very painfully and shamefully average.

Finally, I watch enough Strictly Come Dancing to be irked by the poor shaping of Emma Stone's hands during her final musical number with Ryan Gosling. But that's being quite picky, isn't it?"

For a film so focused on music and theater, it can't manage to pull together any creative effort that breaks the mold. The great musical films have you walking out of the theater with a song in your head that you just can not get out of your mind: Singin' in the Rain, White Christmas, Moulin Rouge's Come What May. None of the songs in La La Land leave any kind of lasting impression. And though Stone and Gosling have good screen presence, it's hard to imagine that there weren't better dancers/singers on offer in LA's sprawling theater scene. Several of the dance scenes and songs seem limited by their talents, and the movie's core message about ambition and creativity would have been much more powerful if the film featured true no-names rather than a highly successful actor and actress."

After suffering thru the beginning, I was a little enthused by the 'pool party' scene, which was finally light, both visually and in mood. But then, it retreated into its marginally directed dirge-y-ness. The wildly over-worked planetarium romance scene looked hokey in this age of great effects... and we are led to believe that two gorgeous adults living in LA are ruminating about a kiss in a way some grade-schoolers might?

The movie only has one good song, which I think the film-makers recognized as it's used again and again in the film.

Pool scenes were lost opportunity to do a brief Esther Williams tribute. Neither star has great vocal chops, which is OK, as it makes their characters down to earth -- still, would have enjoyed better skills - kind of thin singing & I got bored with the repetition of the theme song. Also would have been fun to have more fully developed secondary characters -- i.e. Gosling's sister shows up for 30 seconds as a foil to his messed up life but then she just disappears. Stone has all these roommates who could have provided a counterpoint to her experience but who just serve as props.

Plus, it seems Gosling and Emma Stone aren't very good singers, which I get is part of their characters, but is hard to listen over long stretches in a feature film. ""What's wrong with being romantic,"" Gosling's character asks in the beginning of the film. Nothing, and this film is romantic and charming but I do like to see some development between characters past the visually pleasing song and dance numbers that are really just flashes in the pan. A light, enjoyable film but more style than substance."

Nothing wrong with the instrumental music its the songs that i dislike, which is a shame as visually it was stunning throwback towards the golden age of hollywood musicals.    The songs emma and ryan are forced into trying to sing are demanding stuff that a skilled singer could really make something out of sadly that was not to be.    If these actors had tried to audition for american idol neither ryan or emma would stand a chance of getting in. Yet somehow nobody cares they are lead in a hollywood musical they are still praised to high heavens for la la land its beyond me why all the critics set the bar so incredible low for hollywood actors singing.

Despite that, like I said before, the director in his previous work demonstrated all his potential, the problem is that in this film there is none of that. The complex protagonist that wants to reach a goal, making a path marked by obsession, that implies rupture of own canons and lot of sacrifice to finally find itself again in perfection, is lost. Here the protagonists are nothing but stereotypes, they are empty, circular, and there is no evolution at all. Also we have zero development of secondary roles, simple plot and predictable conflict. The outcome did surprise me, totally unexpected, but cannot save this mediocre picture. The songs are great and enjoyable, nothing to say about them, the performances are fine too, up to the occasion. This film is made in order that the viewer leaves the theater feeling well, but really is a setup to deceive the weak-minded."

I agree with the other reviewer here saying that these days with Kael and Ebert gone, you now have the AA sycophant reviewers giving stuff a pass, and ""the Artist"" and ""Birdman"" are simply prime examples, couldn't have said it better.

Chazelle's second film is simply not up to par with his brilliant work that absolutely floored me, ""Whiplash"".  That work was totally original, inspired by personal experience obviously, and held my attention like I was sitting on a pin cushion throughout, and with a dramatic climax like none seen before.  It is an amazing piece of work and needs to be listed under ""great"" films, and there's also NO comparison whatsoever between the JK Simmons performance in it (beyond brilliant) TO this current film--a mediocre bit part.

Gosling and Stone are multi-talented, I'll give them that, but Stone is overall a better actor, and Gosling came off too plastic and contrived throughout this.  While there are a couple of belly laughs maybe worth 1/3 the price of admission, the overall film had me looking at the time and just dragged on and on waiting for it to end finally.

I thought given the fact that Chazelle was a ""jazzer"" with Gosling trying to transcribe the car radio piece in the first scene, that I would be in for an original treat.  However, the bane of Hollywood trying to market films to too many interest groups e.g. Is it a reflexive film, a musical, a jazz film??  It was just trying to be too many things at once without a coherent vision, so better luck next time Damien, and I can't recommend it overall, and the 94 rating is just way way overhyped."

This is why they are critics to begin with.  This little movie is fine but sure isn't greatness as reviewers might attempt to make you believe.  This is the age we live in.  ""Grease"" was a much better musical.  ""Swingers"" was a wittier and far funnier similar tale of making it in Tinseltown.  Yet of course those two movies were not nominated by The Academy.  This will be by those sheep because of a sheer decline in standards, and simply because it's a stupid musical.  A musical made by a dopey millennial with a dopey millennial sensibility where phony dialogue and dopey millennial slight humor pass for adult reality.  This unoriginal film is thin on all important plot and story craft if not on visual style and the maturity of its theme.  The leads are a Canadian who wears his watch on the wrong wrist and an actress playing an actress who is not all that attractive.  The film does stay with you though which is an important signifier of any truly good movie.

Granted, the film is technically brilliant and nice to look at and features fine performances, singing and dancing.

Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are here to dazzle you with this movie musical serving as ode to both 1950's musicals and screenwriter-director Damien Chazelle's love for jazz. The story is generic but cosy as your favorite pillow: jazz pianist boy meets waitress / aspiring actress girl and they fall in love. And then a whole bunch of people dance and sing. The two lovely stars are both singing and dancing themselves, doing a good job at that. Still, personally I'd have chosen an actress with stronger onscreen presence to pair up with already-legendary Gosling. But you know, whatever.

I am not actually into musicals, so for me, by far the most impressive thing about this feel-good crowdpleaser is the boss man behind the screen: Damien Chazelle. The dude is only nearly 32 years old but he has done three movies already, always as a director and a sole screenwriter. You know him better as the author of 2014's majestic surprise hit ""Whiplash"".

So... go see it. If you like musicals, you will be pleased. If you don't care about them, there's still enough feel-good stuff to enjoy the ride for 128 minutes.

If you are a fan of ""Whiplash"" dying to get another dose of Chazelle, then be prepared for a nice surprise in the form of certain bald guy who should have a bigger role here for sure."

The cinematography wasn't bad, but it was pretty repetitive and bland as the film progressed. The directing the pretty standard and the writing just felt mediocre.

It seems like narcissist--and even more narcissist when all the middle-class white film critic favored this movie. What is that? A tribute to your high school memory? People acclaim this film for being real, but I just did not know how is that real. Only real for a middle-class white girl. Oh she comes from California, she dreams about NYC, she looks pretty, she has the most adorable extracurricular activity, she **** with the most popular boy in her school, so what? All I see is privilege, not universal reality. I highly doubt if any film critic in favor of this has saw A Raisin in the Sun. Beneatha is a self-centered college girl, which is super like Lady Bird. But Beneatha is not the protagonist of A Raisin in the Sun, which reflects the hopeless living condition of African American community in 60s. Moreover, in A Raisin in the Sun, the Youngers have more difficulties, and they can barely find a solution. I think that's what makes a great work of literature--you survive and find faith in a hopeless place. To be honest, what difficulty does Lady Bird have? Has she grown?

I would say that all of the actors and actresses do a really nice job playing the roles they have been given. The hard part is that some of the characters are quite unlikeable. Lady Bird is just all over the place. She is self entitled, selfish, and just straight up weird. Saoirse Ronan is a great actress, but I often was taken out of scenes because she is clearly so much older than the role she is playing. I know 20 year olds routinely play high school kids, but something about her appearance makes her look even older. The movie also doesn't really have a plot. It is a good snapshot of what it is like to be Lady Bird. The movie just doesn't deserve the 9 and 10's critics have been giving it. I chalk that up to a couple factors. One is that Lady Bird is obsessed with New York and moving to where there is more ""culture."" This feeds into the elitist mindset of many critics. The other is that the main character and the director are women. Again, most reviewers have a liberal bias and this will buy the movie a couple extra good will points."

Lady Bird is a well made coming-of-age story, but it doesn't bring much new to the table. Set in 2002, it feels like a nostalgic teenage movie, as though it's 15 years to late for the Gen Xers, and it doesn't adapt the genre to deal with more modern teenage issues. There are no glaring weaknesses, except perhaps the father character who is played completely one-note throughout the film. It was never boring, but I don't expect Lady Bird will stick in my mind like other similar films."
1959,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lady-bird/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,JLuis_001,"Dec 28, 2017",6,"One more case in which I must row against the current and discover something that a person who had already seen this movie told me, apparently you cannot give a negative opinion about this film and considering what I have seen now that I have finished it, I will undoubtedly be crucified by many, but being quite honest for everything they mentioned about it and the huge avalanche of positive reviews it received, in my personal opinion, Lady Bird is one of the biggest disappointments of the year and yes, is perhaps the most overrated movie of the year along with Get Out.

Lady Bird tells the story of Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, a young woman who lives in Sacramento in 2002, regardless of certain narrative resources that the movie does not need to use, like social networks and smartphones, the time frame in which the film takes place it couldn't have been more irrelevant.
My biggest problem has to do with the main character and when something like that happens, you know it's serious, personally my adolescence flew away many years ago, but for me now as then it would be quite clear to expose Christine as a spoiled, selfish and narcissist brat that at all times and in all situations, she only thinks about herself. Everyone is wrong except her. She also lives complaining about the life she has while doing nothing to change her environment beyond the fact the she's trying to enter an out of state college just to leave the place where she feels locked up, not caring at all that her parents are facing financial problems and have made it clear that supporting her financially is not an option, but she doesn't care because like in many other coming of age films, the ''teenagers'' believe they are being repressed in their place of origin and so their talents are not properly exploited. Cliché and repetitive.

The true strength of the film and the story in general lies in everything that surrounds her, that's the best reason to see Lady Bird because most of those characters have more serious problems and forge what she does regardless of whether she believes that's not the case, starting with her mother and her father, it's true that her mother presses too much, but come on, you have to be honest, it's not like Lady Bird leaves her with so many options with her childish tantrums.
Her father is unemployed and struggling with depression trying to provide for her family and yet Lady Bird's concerns lie in what she will do, avoiding helping in any way.
Her boyfriend, her best friend, the guy with whom she loses her virginity, her momentary and popular friend, her adopted brother and her girlfriend, all form a protective halo in a narrative mode because it's the conflicts of those characters what sustain this movie, otherwise Lady Bird wouldn't have been more than just a movie of another teenager incapable of deciding what she hopes to do with her life and that situation has is been seen already too many times in both cinema and real life

The film gets recomposed in its final section where the character absorbs a bit of maturity and enters a new stage of her life, the ending makes it clear but until that point we can only infer what will be of her in the future and perhaps she will become a better person and certainly then she could have been a better character, but it wasn't the case and for me that diminished my enjoyment and enthusiasm for the film in a big way.

I admit that Saoirse Ronan does a good job, but on front of such script, unfortunately the character doesn't stop being annoying. She manages to give it a little more strength for being a great actress, otherwise I think that the character would have been lost miserably.

Greta Gerwing delivers a film that looks good, that has an uneven but sustained rhythm. She manages to take her first film to a safe harbor but if she really wants to continue making films as a filmmaker, she needs stronger scripts."

I don’t remember if I went to a prom or when/how I lost my virginity, having special friends at school, etc., so I sort of kept thinking, “Come on—let’s get on with the story!” A lot of what the self named Lady Bird was foreign to me or I just don’t remember feeling a lot of what she or the rest of the kids felt.

I became aware of Saorise Ronan, who at 23 plays the 17, 18 year old Lady Bird, when 2 years ago she was in “Brooklyn” getting the best actress nomination. She had made some ‘noise’ in a couple of other movies but I don’t remember her or them. This movie makes a bona fide A list actress of her. Laurie Metcalf was primarily known for her work as Roseanne’s sister on the television show of the same name receiving 10 Emmy nominations winning 3 for that role and currently as Sheldon’s mother on “The Big Ban” and also winning 2 Tony awards for her theatre work. There is no doubt that she will get an Oscar nomination for this mother as the mother you want to hate but won’t.

Tracy Letts, as the father, is mainly known for winning the 2008 Pulitzer prize and a Tony award for writing “August: Osage County” and for his performance on “Homeland”. He won a Tony award for acting and has recently done more acting in television and movies. The relationship between him and Lady Bird is the sweetest part of the film and his fight against depression is affecting.

The rest of the supporting cast from Lucas Hedges and Timothee Chalamet as boyfriends, Beanie Feldstein and Odeya Rush as girl friends along with Lois Smith as a nun at the Catholic school Christine, Lady Bird’s given name, and Jordon Rodrigues as Lady Bird’s older, adopted brother plus others give solid support.

The movie was written and directed by Greta Gerwig who does a better job directing than the writing.

“Lady Bird” is not a movie I want to see again and though I got involved now and then with the characters, at times shedding a tear or two, there is no faulting the acting and will probably see their names nominated for awards."
1964,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lady-bird/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,TrevorsView,"Nov 17, 2017",6,"We each have nicknames given to us by loved ones. My dad always called my sister “boop” (for reasons unknown), and he called me “TFF” for “Trevor-fo-fevor;” one friend of mine went by his middle name “Xavier,” and another calls his daughter “goose.” Nicknames always become so personal because they say practically everything about the bond between the name’s owner and the name’s caller.

So what could be told about a girl who gave herself the nickname Lady Bird? One, she has high self-dependency. Two, she seeks image confidence. Three, she feels too distanced from mom and dad to accept their nicknames. Indeed, you learn even more about Lady Bird as her graduation impends- class of 2003.

Lady Bird just wants to fly away from dull old Sacramento for college on the East Coast; her disrespect upon the confused adults seems understandable enough, since 9/11 still dawdles fresh in the nation’s memory. However, Lady Bird only knows Sacramento’s restrictive side. Director/writer Greta Gerwig, along with the small production crew, pays off their united vision in a humble, down to earth fashion similar to an early 2000’s comedy. Gerwig’s often slow/often fast approach documents Lady Bird’s problems under the awkward pressure of growing up into the unknown: awareness about weight gain, knowing who her real friends are, uncertainty about sexuality, plus more you survived in your youth.

Lady Bird’s oppressive school adds but an extra layer of confusion. The familiar details of a religious institution restrict every teen’s need for self-discovery: dancers keep ten inches apart for the Holy Spirit, skirts below knee level, etc. Lady Bird expresses her attitude about the rules by the way she casually eats the communion wafers as if they were goldfish crackers.

Yet the girl’s shaky maternal bond most allows the coming of age story’s real heart to bloom. Right away the two argue in the car about college, a disagreement she ends by opening the door to the pavement. Now a pink cast on her forearm, a profanity written on toward the one she accuses as responsible, explains their whole relationship. Contrary to Lady Bird’s assumptions, mother truly loves her, as expressed through a clear balance between disciplined silence and a compassionate ear to keep Lady Bird’s head on straight. You may even notice a subtle role reversal, proving Lady Bird’s invisible likenesses to her family. So I wholeheartedly recommend Lady Bird for any mother-daughter night out.

While the script’s more personal than usual, it still comes off one-sided, mainly against Lady Bird’s overly oppressive Catholic school experience. Both inside and outside the school, Lady Bird’s rebellious actions, such as shoplifting, play either for cheap laughs or to cast a stark shadow over religion. Her two older adoptive siblings also contribute little plot importance besides forgettable reactions about her attitude. These two piercing studded emos of ethnic color should have been more down-to-earth voices of reason, ones different from the parents or teachers, but this opportunity is missed.

Gerwig’s approach predominantly passed the opportunity of true love for Sacramento as a location. Remember that song about West Virginia? A love letter about the state’s old life: older than the trees and younger than the mountains? No comparable love for the city of Sacramento resolves Lady Bird’s matters in a satisfying fashion by the end.

An added complaint goes to the crew’s decision to cast 23-year-old Saoirse Ronan to play a teenager, even though she looks too old to play someone underaged. A couple of the other actors halt the enjoyment, particularly Lucas Hedges’ (Manchester by the Sea), clumsy performance as Lady Bird’s little turtle-dove.

Although many other strong performances keep the production’s awards thirst hydrated, especially Oscar-bound Laurie Metcalf, who vigorously plays Mrs. Lady Bird. Stephen Henderson, the underrated thespian from Fences, satisfies as well as the school’s cheerful old drama coach.

So, if I had a nickname for Lady Bird, it would still embrace the initials LB, for “Loving Believability,” as you believe the low points and love the high points. Everyone itches at some desire to leave home, so we each could use a comforting soul like Lady Bird by our side."

Et pourtant, pas mal de choses sonnent juste, comme par exemple cette idée que l'amour filial n'est certainement pas inné et que par ailleurs, des parents totalement irresponsables ont des enfants qu'ils sont incapables d'aimer et d'élever alors que d'autres -qui n'en ont pas-  sont des irresponsables qui savent prodiguer tout l'amour et l'éducation (à leur façon...) dont les mômes peuvent avoir besoin...

Bref, en ce bas monde, tout ne tombe pas à pic comme il faudrait, l'instinct maternel (ou paternel) n'étant pas distribué de façon... idéale ! alors évidemment, le petit bout de chou qui fait ici en quelque sorte la Cosette de service est une gamine touchante et cette ""famille"" de bric et de broc est tout-à-fait attachante ! pendant une bonne heure à peu près...

Mais la légèreté de cette première heure est sans doute précisément... trop légère et superficielle, comme détachée du réel, puis la réalité **** nos irresponsables non pas ""affreux, sales et méchants"" (non, rien à voir ici avec l'ironie viscérale et cruellement drôle du film italien !) mais jolis, propres et gentils !

Ce retour aux contingences du monde réel (et ""normal"" en somme) dans cette seconde partie du film s'avère peu crédible et -lui aussi- déconnecté de la réalité ou alors présenté de telle façon qu'on y croit pas une seule seconde... Finalement, on se demande si on se fout de nous, s'il s'agit d'une simple comédie sociale faite à la va-vite, d'un drame pleurnichard qui ne savait pas où il allait ou le résultat d'une incompétence généralisée...

D'autant que les deux heures sont clairement de trop, alourdissant énormément le propos et le drame familial par sa lenteur abrutissante... Cela étant, j'ignore si c'est volontaire ou non, mais les moments quasi-drolatiques sont assez nombreux, ma foi, notamment grâce aux comédiens très attachants eux aussi..."

Hirokazu could create a better story with same cast than this tricky one. I didn't like the ending, it doesn't make you satisfied, also the secrets that reveal at the end, it doesn't make surprised, it's better to keep the story clear from beginning, I think it will be more sentimental.

El propósito de Shoplifters es importante, complejo y con un valor reflexivo enorme, sin embargo, su valor final está en el dilema moral (que solo propone) y no en la experiencia narrativa y cultural que trata de integrar a ese dilema.
Esta es una familia que puede ayudar y adoptar a una niña con quien solo ganan dilemas morales y económicos.
Con 2 horas de duración, Shoplifters le dedica 3/4 del tiempo a explorar esos dilemas y exponer una gran gama de emociones personales. Al principio es fácil dejare llevar por esa observación y admirar los detalles de un espacio oprimido en una cultura específica, pero la falta de tensión y la gran carga de sensibilidad provoca que la #película se vuelva pesada y menos conmovedora, aun cuando visualmente intriga el hecho de que puede agregar textura, temperatura y tamaño a la historia. Es hasta el último tercio cuando se presentan una serie de enigmas que no se introducen previamente de forma adecuada. A partir de ahí, la actuación se eleva minimamente para cooperar con un suspenso con poco sustento, pero que tiene éxito en plantear un dilema moral que, mientras más inocente sea el espectador del propósito, menos atención ganará.

The porpoise of ""Shoplifters"" it's important, complex and with a big reflective value, however, its final value is in its moral dilemma (which only proposes) and not in the narrative and cultural experience that tries to incorporate in that dilemma.
This is a family that can help and adopt a little girl who only brings economic and moral dilemmas.
With 2 hours of duration, Shoplifters dedicates 3/4 of its time to explore those dilemmas and expose a wide range of personal emotions. At the beginning its easy to let go by that observation and admire the details of a repress space in a specific culture, but the lack of tension and the big deal of sensibility provokes that the #movie becomes heavy and each time less moving, even when visually intrigues the fact that it can add texture, temperature, and size to the story. It's until the last third when a series of enigmas are presented without being introduced properly. From there, the acting elevates minimally to cooperate with a suspense with little sustain, but it achieves to stipulate a moral dilemma that, while more innocent the spectator is of the porpoise, less attention it will have."

1972,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shoplifters/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,OlivierPiel,"Feb 18, 2019",4,"I like my Japanese films as much as the next Western snob but I really had to give up 25 min in. I read critics comparing this to Ozu, Mike Leigh, the Italian neo-realists or even Bresson. However Ozu and Bresson use a much more focused and minimalist cinematography that convey a far superior poetry and art. Some of the scenes feel as gratuitous and mostly used for shock-value for the Japanese middle-class audience (the introduction to the family home with the granny cutting toenails at the table is so ham-fisted than it becomes too farcical). Other critics say that you have to wait for the second part to see resolution. If that is a case, then the director commits the number crime in art: boredom! As for the other comments on ""humanism"" (heart-wrenching etc...) and ""naturalism"" or ""realism"", these actually confirm the lack of intrinsic artistic value of this film since ""mirroring the reality of those less fortunate"" reeks of the most hypocritical impulse of the middle-class, pity and commiseration."
1973,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shoplifters/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,BHBarry,"Dec 6, 2018",6,"""Shoplifters"" is a Japanese language film written and directed by Hirokazu Koreeda. This is a difficult film to watch for a number of reasons, the most prominent being that the script and the story it tells is confusing and almost impossible to follow. The last third of the film tries to explain who the characters really are and the motivations each has in relation to the other but this places too much of a burden on the audience who, for 2/3 of the film had to sit adrift and at sea in trying to find out exactly what is going on. Much like the critics of the artsy Ingmar Bergman movies, so many of the critics who loved this film saw more in it than I believe the writer/director ever intended. The editing room needed someone in it in addition to Mr. Koreeda in order to give objective cuts, segues and scene placement changes so that the story sought to be told would be more easily understood. In its present form, however, and bearing in mind the kindness of the season, I it a 6.0  with the responsibility for this low rating falling squarely on the shoulders (and probably the ego) of Mr. Koreeda."

Unfortunately, his appearance interferes with her all-consuming job. After being rejected, he creates an alter ego and insinuates himself into her career. His slightly absurd presence seems implausible and her reaction is surprisingly muted, however it's pretty obvious where this is headed. Simonischek's performance is eccentric, while Hüller eventually lets us see the cracks in her resolve. Even though the premise could be considered amusing, the execution was more European in its subdued approach. The historical literary definition of a comedy is a story that ends happily, but the modern audience likes to laugh. I didn't find one funny moment in the whole film and 2:45 is a long time to keep hoping for fun. (In German with subtitles)"
1975,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Spangle,"May 5, 2017",4,"Toni Erdmann is not a funny movie at all. It is cringe comedy for two hours and forty two minutes. This film is a major misfire that really flew right past me and made me wonder if everybody else was watching the same film I was. Immediately, I knew that this was a film that would likely not be my style once the character of Winfried Conradi / Toni Erdmann (Peter Simonischek) was introduced. With childish jokes left and right that are incomprehensible as jokes in the human realm, the film continuously shows his prank-influenced style of jokes in a nearly three hour long compilation of YouTube pranks. Going to Romania to try and make sure his daughter Ines (Sandra Huller) is enjoying life in the country, the film shows him try to get her cheer up and become less serious. While their relationship is nice, the film itself is really anything but for most of the runtime.

The jokes vary from being completely undetectable to being cringe-inducing when he ruins her business dealings in Romania to being just flat-out childish. Examples of each are when he tells the guy there is a bomb in a package, him creating the alter ego of Toni Erdmann who holds various titles and is all an inside joke where he pretends to be somebody else to creep on his daughter, or when he sits on a whoopy cushion. In essence, whoever conceived of the comedy in the film likely just finished watching an Adam Sandler movie and Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot. Considering I did not like the latter and Sandler movies are universally trash, there is no way Toni Erdmann was going to be a film I was going to enjoy with this style of comedy and awkward humor at its core. There was honestly not really a moment where I chuckled or came near smiling, except in sarcasm when I got progressively more-and-more aggravated that I was wasting nearly three hours of my life watching this schlock.

However, fortunately, its drama is very good at times. I still hate the father character who is one-note and has no idea how to relate to his daughter beyond making childish daughters. Meanwhile, his daughter is a serious businesswoman. Sure, I do not understand having that much passion for your career, but she does. Why is she the bad guy who just will not let her grating father into her life? He ****. I would cut him off too. What is worse is when his influence begins to rub off on her with the cringe-inducing naked party to build team chemistry. A last second decision to cover up her own error, the party is a failure and an intensely awkward at that. However, Toni Erdmann really saves itself in the final act with a raw and emotion-filled scene between Winfried and Ines where they discuss happiness and life. The two have finally come together again and no longer have that great distance between them, which is a nice thing to see. I just wish that Winfried was not eye gougingly annoying, which is he is not in his best moments such as at the egg painting party. Raw and open about who he is and how he wishes his daughter could lighten up, the audience can really root for the guy in this moment. Unfortunately, it is immediately followed up with him showing up to the naked party in a huge mascot outfit, which is a major turn off and plays too heavily on absurdist and awkward humor, considering his daughter is naked right in front of him.

However, the strong dramatic leanings of the film are undone with a gratuitous runtime that never really justifies itself. The film floats by for nearly three hours and I could never really figure out why it had done so. This is a film where I wish some American studio got their hands on it and cut it down from 162 minutes to 90 minutes. It never needed to be that long and needed to go under the knife for some serious liposuction. As it stands, it is a tall task to watch with practically no enjoyment in store whatsoever. It is not funny. Its drama borders on annoying until the final act. Its characters are all one-dimensional with Winfried being nothing but a goof ball who loved his dog and daughter, while Ines is just a stuck up **** of a businesswoman (a character trait that is becoming far too common nowadays, as if there is no middle ground between a woman who is passionate about her career and one who is just a callous **** who cuts jobs without blinking). Thus, even its character study inclinations fall flat and really reveal very little about the nature of the characters as individuals, only in the context of how they behave with one another.

Fortunately, it is this father-daughter relationship and both of their attempts to try and mend that broken link. However, the film is so unrelentingly unfunny, crude, and poorly written, its emotional core is nearly entirely blotted out. Had this film been a tight 90 minutes or a little more, it would have been far more enjoyable, as a lot of the fluff and annoying bits would have been cut out. Unfortunately, it is 162 minutes long and never seems likely to end."

Still, one can’t take their eyes from the screen as he tries to manipulate one last big score to escape likely a lifetime of bad decisions.

However, I found the script to be claustrophobic and unthinking, perhaps what the producers wanted. I found Sandler's character to be so intensely unlikeable, it was hard to see the movie as a whole. Yes, I was aware the entire movie how well-produced it was, how committed the actors were, especially Sandler. How difficult the cross dialogue and action was. It's a major achievement in those respects.

And, sadly, there were places in the movie that I was just plain bored. I even began to look at my iPhone messages, etc. Not good.

Sandler pulled off quite an incredible and difficult performance, Oscar-worthy, but yesterday I saw A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood, and in spite of disliking Tom Hanks for many years, I was astonished by the nuances of his performance, so I will be rooting for him as best actor, rather than Sandler. Sorry, Adam."

I so wanted to like this movie, and i so wanted Sandler to really do something decent and break out of his comedy attire. Well, he does that but, sadly the movie was a lot of noise from the start. The first part of the movie where credits plastered the scenes, i was curious if all that chaotic shouting of lines and that god awful 80´s Vangelis-carbon-copy score drowning everything else was the staple for this movie, i was partially correct.
At time the movie takes a breather, but it is not long before it´s going at it again.
To be honest, i scrubbed trough the last half. I was getting stressed out with a headache of the constant shouting, intrusive music and the messed up cutting.
In the end i felt a little sorry for Adam Sandler. He does NOTHING wrong in his role, But with that script and soundtrack and everybody running around being idiots, what can you do but feel for the guy. He had an ultimate chance, with praised directors on the up, but sadly got sidelined by this mess. There is plenty done right, but equally amount done wrong as well, which is why i end up rolling out a 5/10. Sad."

It’s just a question of which plate is going to fall first. We’re left to wonder how this person lacking common sense ever came to own a jewelry store in Manhattan’s prestigious diamond district or what his wife and mistress ever saw in him in the first place. This is a guy who’s willing to make huge risks to get rich quick, so I never believed for a second he would ever take the 5 months necessary to meticulously research the mining industry in Somalia and figure out how to successfully acquire that black opal. And if he is that kind of careful investor he wouldn’t just impulsively loan it out 10 minutes after it arrives! I also didn’t believe this manic reckless adrenaline junkie would ever have the presence of mind to schedule a prostate exam. His death was a forgone conclusion; the only question was how. If the Safdies wanted to really surprise us they should have given us a happy ending where all those plates remain safe due to sheer luck mixed with some previously unseen genius on Howard’s part. As for the relentless intensity, it was mostly without variation and thus felt monotonous, redundant and just noisy.

What's more, the narrative closely parallels the 1974 release ""The Gambler,"" augmented by a sense of hyper-desperation not unlike the directors' 2017 offering ""Good Time,"" a combination that's not exactly original or particularly interesting. And then there's the much-praised performance by Adam Sandler in a dramatic role, a capable but overrated portrayal that essentially consists of little more than two hours of the actor screeching F-bombs in a manner similar to his wise-ass characters in his long strong of eminently forgettable comedies.

Laney Brooks(Sarah Silverman) does bad things. Married with kids, she takes the drugs she wants, sleeps with the men she wants, disappears when she wants. Now, with the destruction of her family looming, and temptation everywhere, Laney makes one last desperate attempt at redemption.

This movie leaves you sore and rather agitated. Partly because that's the point of the movie and partly, just partly, because we didn't ever really care enough to keep watching to the end.

This was not the case with me. I soldiered through till the very, predictable end for a few reasons. Well really one reason actually now that I think about it. But that one reason makes a definite snooze fest into a spectacle to see.

I am of course referring to none other than Sarah Silverman. 2015 has been a year which yielded many surprises in breaking type cast, but Sarah Silverman's transformation into Laney, a narcissistic home wrecker, might be the most surprising. I usually don't have too much doubt when it comes to Best Actresses so it pains me to say this, Sarah isn't going to win. Though she is the best female performer of the year, its unlikely that the Oscars would give any awards to an actors first type cast break. With that being said, she was revoltingly engaging to watch, casting a disgusting yet thought provoking shadow of an average American housewife's misdeeds. It was painful to watch at times but is ultimately rewarding on a character level. More than able to inject a few snips of humor to lighten the dreary mood, Silverman shines!

In terms of the other actors Josh Charles plays a sympathetic lead but I would prefer him in a courtroom. The kids were very good and churned out some great performances. Basically the Brooks family is brilliant and the rest of the cast pails in comparison. Shame but not entirely their fault.

The writer is to blame for most of this movie. Paige Dylan's intentions, though noble, are rather misguided. She mistakes tears and bad deeds for character development. Though this works to some extent, offering hints of insight, the audience never gets a full perspective into the minds of Laney and the Brooks family, though we feel like we do because of some devoted performances from its leads. Another aspect that I didn't enjoy much was the sheer predictability of the whole ordeal coupled with the poor direction makes this movie a Plodding and Uninteresting mess on a behind the scenes level.

I Smile Back is amiable, albeit shallow, fair with a standout performance by Silverman. it gets a C+ or a 5/10."

Between Two Ferns: The Movie

I don't want to be that guy that thinks that one should stick to what they do. There is nothing wrong with trying something new. Whether it be physically, changing locations or genres or changing formats. On that note, the co-writer and director Scott Aukerman's film is a fresh peak behind the camera of a lovable show. This might be the pitch at the Netflix office. It should be it. What's best and the worst thing about the film, is the admiration they have for the lead character, the interviewer, Zach. They don't take him for granted. They don't want to lose him. And in order to do so, they are returning back to those old sitcom sugar coated schemes that gathered crowd like controversy does to media.

But it doesn't work. Not the fact that the interviewer Zach and the character Zach are completely different personalities. If anything that should have made it more grounding and fun to watch him play. Watch him juggle the on and off screen face twitch beautifully in the middle of this race against time chaos. And instead what has happened is that the crux, the thrill of those interviews have been snatched away from us.

Now, despite the insults are audaciously wrong and cuts deep to sensitive parts of the lives of these celebrities, the intention, the motif paints itself like a commercial strategy. A strategy that Will Ferrell explains and has based his empire on. The click bait theory is glorified by them inadvertently. And something that is actually menacingly taking over the authenticity over the data, the enormous amount of data flooded out in the world.

Here are the positives. The best part about this movie is that most of the celebrity interviews are pretty funny. The segments with Matthew McConaughey, John Legend, Paul Rudd, and Peter Dinklage are pretty funny while the other celebrity interviews are entertaining at best. There are some outtakes during the end credits that are funnier than most of the film. That’s kind of disappointing that your outtakes are funnier than most of your film. I think Zach Galifianakis does a good job with what he is given and helps keep this film afloat. The film has this mockumentary feel for it and the camera work compliments that. It’s shot in a way a mockumentary would be and it’s refreshing. The film can be self aware at some points and doesn’t try to make itself bigger than what it is supposed to be. The film does what it needs to do and then it is over. Here are the negatives. The story is kind of lame. It’s another one of those “redemption stories because a character did something embarrassing” that has been done to death. The film doesn’t do anything to establish itself as something different.  Everything other than the celebrity interviews is incredibly boring and starts to drag heavily. Fortunately, as it starts to drag even heavily, it switches to another celebrity interview. This also leads to a weird structure issue though. It does start to feel out of place when it changes so suddenly but it does lead to better scenes. About 75% of the jokes aren’t that funny which is unfortunate since it is a comedy film. Like I said earlier, I got a bunch of laughs out of the outtakes than I did most of the film. The editing for this film feels very amateurish. It has a bunch of quick cuts that are distracting and obnoxious. This also leads to a pacing issue. It’s weirdly paced due to the quick cuts and awkward structure. It’s these issues that really drag the film down. Overall, Between Two Ferns: The Movie has some funny sequences but is held back by a cookie cutter story, lots of boring moments, and awkward pacing. I give Between Two Ferns: The Movie a 4/10."

Ian McKellen looked more the part as the earl of Southampton, I thought.
There are definitely some poignant moments but there are relatively dull moments too. Of course the story of Shakespeare's young son dying and him not being there to witness it, is a sad one - its nothing to trivialise at all, certainly. I believe this film was written by Ben Elton and I could see that it perhaps inspired him to go on to write the BBC TV sitcom 'Upstart Crow' - indeed, Shakespeare is called precisely that during the film. There is some nice scenery, so that's a plus as well but I did think the script could perhaps have been improved, as on ocassion it felt a little slow and without a real structure. I reckon it's worth sticking with, as it becomes most poignant right towards the end but if your not keen on period dramas, or interested in Shakespeare, then its not really worth seeing. Also, I should point out that it is a fictionalised account of what happened during the final years of Shakespeare's life, after the famous Globe theatre was burnt to the ground. The irony of the film being called 'All Is True' has not passed me by(!). It does provide food for thought but I wouldn't say its one of my favourite films of this sort (costume/period dramas), no. If your a fan of Judi Dench, however, I would recommend it and if your interested in a pre-Upstart Crow Shakespeare film written by Ben Elton."

Directed, produced by, and starring Kenneth Branagh, All Is True is a pleasant enough film obviously born from great reverence, but is also clumsily episodic in structure, and relatively free of conflict, focusing instead on non-incident. By the very nature of the years during which it takes place (1613-1616), Ben Elton's screenplay is full of interpolations and suppositions, some of which are interesting, but many of which don't work. There's a much better film hidden in the contours of All Is True, a darker story examining Shakespeare's (Branagh) psychology; his inability to process the death of his son Hamnet (Sam Ellis), his guilt over the fact that he put his career ahead of his family, his possible misogyny, his obsession with his legacy. These issues are in the background, but they are not the focus, and whilst All Is True is perfectly fine, it's also perfectly forgettable.

Possibly a palette-cleanser for Branagh, allowing him to return to the familiarity of Shakespeare, after several years working on relatively impersonal projects, and with two blockbusters on the way, All Is True begins on June 29, 1613, as Shakespeare watches the Globe Theatre burn to the ground, after a canon misfired during a performance of All Is True. Devastated, he retires and returns home to Stratford. Coldly received by his wife Anne (Judi Dench) and youngest daughter, Judith (Kathryn Wilder), he gets a slightly better welcome from his eldest, Susanna (Lydia Wilson). Still mourning the death of Judith's twin, his only son, who died from plague aged 11 in 1596, Shakespeare decides to grow a garden to honour his memory. However, he must also try to deal with Judith's hatred for him, stemming from her conviction that he believes the wrong twin died.

Easily the best in the film, involves Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton (Ian McKellen) visiting Stratford. Discussing his identity as the ""fair youth"" to whom Shakespeare addresses the first 126 sonnets, Shakespeare quotes in its entirety Sonnet 29, with Branagh reading it as an agonised ode to an impossible love. Southampton then also recites the poem, with McKellen's intonation changing it into a celebration of the power of art to transcend such foolish distractions as love. It's a beautifully shot, incredibly well acted, and nuanced scene that, if it accomplishes nothing else, serves to remind us just what talented actors can do when reciting the exact same text.

One of the film's main themes is, of course, family, with Elton's script focusing on how resentful Anne and Judith have become of Shakespeare. We don't know a great deal about the real Judith, so much of Elton's characterisation is speculative. The film's Judith is a protofeminist, a brilliant woman railing against the narrow-minded patriarchy her father endorses. The likelihood of this being the case is slim at best, but Wilder is excellent in the part and makes Judith much more believable than the character has any right to be. The film acknowledges that Shakespeare was a neglectful father and husband, and never fully gets behind him as he defends himself by citing the cultivation of his genius. However, by the end, even he doesn't believe this himself, coming to understand the price his family paid for his greatness.

However, there are some considerable problems. First and foremost is the script, which employs an extremely episodic organisational principal, with scene after scene addressing one and only one issue at a time, ensuring each issue is cleared before moving onto the next. Scenes often involve the characters saying only what is necessary to get to the next scene, with little room to breathe, almost as if we're watching a ""previously on"" montage of a TV show.

The casting is also problematic. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Dench and McKellen as much as the next man, but that doesn't change the fact that they are both badly miscast. Both play their characters as elderly, but in 1613-1616, Anne (played by the 84-year-old Dench) was 57-60, and Southampton (played by the 79-year-old McKellen) was only 40-43. Additionally, Anne was six years older than Shakespeare, but Dench is 26 years older than Branagh, and it shows, serving only to distract from the content.

As a Kenneth Branagh fan (and a fan of Ben Elton's Upstart Crow (2016)), I was disappointed with All Is True. The film tries to strike a balance between a laid-back and **** story about a retired writer, and a study of filial grief. Some elements unquestionably work; the Southampton scene, Shakespeare's struggle to reconcile his genius with the personal cost of that genius, Judith's resentment of Hamnet. But a lot doesn't work. It's an inoffensive and perfectly fine film, but given the director and the subject, it could, and should, have been so much better."

2047,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/doctor-sleep/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,BryanAndrew,"Apr 9, 2020",6,"'Doctor Sleep' is personally a disappointing sequel to the iconic cult classic 'The Shining', that sways toward being an superhero-eque action thriller rather than a psychological horror, and yet drags on way more than it should have, filled with unfulfilled build-up and directionless dialogue that poorly attempts to convey a deeper meaning. The plot of the film, although comparatively broader than that of 'The Shining', opts for a more shallow and straight-forward storytelling style. The acting was also rather dull and fails to evoke any sense of fear or desperation in the otherwise horrendous situations that the characters find themselves in. The set and costume/makeup design of the film's rendition of the Overlook Hotel and its ghostly residents is certainly nostalgic but fails to bring anything new to the table despite being almost 40 years apart from the original film; the same goes for the movie's run-of-the-mill cinematography and bland sound design. The visual effects of the 'astral projection' scenes toward the early middle of the film were promising and actually entertaining to behold but the film detracts from that later on in the film and we are left with sloppy CGI scenes later on. All-in-all, the film is still an interesting watch for those who enjoy thrillers and those who are fond of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, but don't expect anything that would evoke anywhere close to the same level of disturbance or terror as the classic film did back in 1980. 'Doctor Sleep' scores a 6.25/10."
2048,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/doctor-sleep/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,netlord80,"Feb 27, 2020",6,"This is a review of the theatrical release.

This film is a worthy followup to The Shining.  The story is very compelling right from the start.  There were some elements of the film that do tend to take you out of the film though.  These issues were almost unavoidable due to how iconic the performances were in the original film.  I will go into more detail a bit further in, but I would still strongly recommend this film.

The recast characters from the original were pretty mixed in my view.  Alex Essoe and Roger Dale Floyd were absolutely phenomenal playing Wendy and Danny from the 1980's.  Alex Essoe in particular did such a good job that I was stunned by how she was able to perfectly capture the performance of Shelley Duvall.  Halloran and Jack are a different story all together.  Those performances really dragged the film down a bit in my view.  I can't blame the actors or filmmakers for that.  Having originally been played by Scatman Crothers and Jack Nicholson, there simply wasn't much they could do.  Both the actors and the roles were simply too iconic.  The best they could have done were impressions, and that would have been far worse. It took a lot of courage for the actors to take on those roles in the first place, so credit is due in that respect.

A major positive is that the film has you invested from the very beginning.  Kyliegh Curran was outstanding in this film.  There are several scenes that would have been very challenging and she absolutely nailed it.  There is one scene in particular were the subtlety of her performance was simply outstanding. I would rate the bad guys as good, not great.  They simply weren't given much to work with.  Who and what they are is only hinted at, which is a very good thing.  This is based on a Stephen King novel, so that was likely never explained there either.  This is a good thing and I am glad they held true to that aspect of King's writing.  Not everything needs an explanation.  In fact, the more frightening things in horror are always mysterious, the unknown.

All of this being said, the tension in the film feels a bit muted.  I never had a serious feeling of dread at any point in the film.  The power dynamic was set up in a way, that the villains never felt like a serious threat in the film.  There are some tense scenes, but I never felt like the protagonists were at serious risk of losing at any point.

The ending of the film was serviceable, but not really great.  There was one moment that was clear fan service that was really pointless.  Aside from that, it was another good, not great part of the film.  The biggest issue I had with the ending was that I saw it coming a mile away.  Overall it was very predictable, but still enjoyable to watch.

This film is certainly worth a watch, but it does have a number of issues.  If you can look past those, you will have a good time with this film."

And, IMO, The ending ruined the movie. They changed too much from the book to really drag fans to seats and I think that is what cost them in the end.

Too many movies in one and too inhomogeneous. The part I most appreciated is about the management of the shining, an ambivalent paranormal power that risked being still treated as a metaphor for adolescent issues (Stan Lee, Marvel, cinecomics). Instead, small debutante Kyliegh Curran and Ewan McGregor wander around in adult and less unresolved territories than ""Red Lights"" (Cortés 2012), favored by the stage presence of Cliff Curtis, Bruce Greenwood, Zahn McClarnon (here a native North American Colin Farrell) and above all of an unforgettable Rebecca Ferguson. The part on immortality (the True Knot vampire villains) and afterlife (the Doctor Sleep's dialogues with the dying) is frivolous, and the one on the Overlook Hotel simply bogus. Taking note that no image of Flanagan possesses a single shred of Kubrick's iconicity, I would have chosen to avoid confrontation at any cost."

I found it difficult to watch as the characters nor the world ever appeared organic or mysterious, rather than caricatures of human beings, spilling exposition and making forced decisions. You can tell all the ideas in the movie are genious when flying off the page of Stephen King, but the film language doesnt really do justice to his sense of darkness and evil. The same goes to its relationship with Kubrick's The Shining with which shares the same amount of similarities as fine wine does to kool-aid. Finally, if the movie wasn't insufrible enough, they couldnt let go of the opportunity of trying to establish a franchise with the last scene."
2053,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/doctor-sleep/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,JLuis_001,"Nov 15, 2019",6,"When the adaptation of Doctor Sleep was announced I must say that I was quite skeptical. How do you make a sequel to such a famous book and such a famous film?
How do you unite both of them? And how do you attract the audiences? Surprisingly, Mike Flanagan succeeded, although relying significantly on Kubrick's film. That's not a bad thing because in one way or another how could you announce it as a sequel to The Shining in the cinema without recognizing Kubrick's film?

The changes themselves are not so annoying, they're understandable and after all as I have said repeatedly, a book and a film are very different narrative media.

The film itself is pretty entertaining although its duration is excessive. Especially considering how scattered and muddled its beginning feels, but it manages to catch pace and although it has its problems, this is due more to the unfortunate need to overexplain what is happening on the screen instead of giving more agility to the narrative.
Ewan McGregor doesn't do a bad job but I didn't feel his work so solid, the truth is that I felt him somewhat disconnected. Rebecca Ferguson on the other hand feels more involved but the story fails to give her a memorable moment, which is a shame.

And even though it can be considered that this film is one of King's best adaptations, it should also be clarified that this is due to its final act because after all and even if it may not seem true to some, the biggest impression the film will leave you comes from the scenes at the Overlook Hotel, but I repeat that's not a bad thing.

Doctor Sleep is not a bad film at all as I said it is one of King's best adaptations and it's known that getting that is very difficult but Mike Flanagan did it.
He continues to consolidate, he did it with Gerald's Game and especially with The Haunting of Hill House and here he offers another good addition to his filmography. I recommend it, with certain reservations but I think it's worth it. It is a worthy sequel. Maybe not from the massive legacy of Kubrick's masterpiece but justifies its existence."

Doctor Sleep

Mike Flanagan who directed and adapted this controversial novelization for the screen is an apt choice to voice the second swing by Stephen King on Dan's character and the supernatural element it possesses. Why controversial? It actually is like being in a tug of war game where you are the price. But I think Flanagan found a sweet spot, that gray area that any horror director would love to have in plenty. And that is why his procedure that takes its time properly, gets the job done. It couldn't be more book-ish. It reeks of old book and I love every aspect of that. Each character, every fabric of information that stacks and builds the final countdown brick by brick is simply novelizing.

No regrets. If you have to host a news show as such, you have to stage it like this. No need to celebrate or electrify, just words floating around, so loud, so big that even performance and other characteristics gets overlapped by King's vision. In this sense it feels, I don't want to say anti-Kubrick but definitely pro-King. But you can only walk far away if you are expecting for the audience to read this story on screen rather than experience.

Ergo, comes these stills and thrills that has the mind bending look that appears like Stanley Kubrick's dream. The swooshing and whooshing of the adrenaline rush that warps these characters to their self-created reality and the deafening snapping of reality that wakes them up. Another asset is of course Ewan McGregor as Dan with this time axe on HIS hands. McGregor's performance is magnificent, child like it seems to me, even though he tells it to be inspired from Jack Nicholson's madness. He cries when he is terrified and falls for the easiest motion that exists. All in all, Doctor Sleep is a functioning system. You don't see that nowadays."

Somewhere in the middle of the movie, while shifting my weight from left to right butt cheek, I imagined how a person who hadn't read the book could follow this story. If you're going to watch this at a theater, do yourself a favor and scan the Cliff's Notes version of the book before you go.

Rose the Hat should be supernatural evil wrapped in a beautiful body.

2062,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/doctor-sleep/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Colginator,"Nov 8, 2019",5,"Stanley Kurbrick's The Shining is my all time favourite horror movie. Through a mixture of Kurbrick's meticulous attention to detail and the films haunting score, it had this feeling of constant dread that loomed over every scene. Across the film it builds up the history and mythology of Overlook hotel in a way that constantly made us raise questions, but without ever offering us any clear answers. Instead it condensed this history into a story of spousal abuse and combined it with some iconic performances from Nicholson and Duvall to achieve the ideal of what all horror films should strive to achieve.

Needless to say this sets a high bar for any film to live up to. But with King himself writing his own sequel novel in 2013 and the current trend for studios to cash in on as many nostalgic properties as they can, it was only a matter of time before Doctor Sleep got made into a film. We now get a loose adaptation of King's novel following a grown up Danny Torrance after the events of the first film (and not the vastly different book) as he attempts to deal with his dark past and the horrors of the supernatural world.

It's a pretty strong setup for a continuation and at first the film seems to do a decent job at exploring this potential. We see a washed up Danny trapped in a bottle and struggling with the ghosts of the Overlook hotel in a precariously similar situation to his own father. This aspect of the film is definitely elevated by McGreggors performance who really channels his own history with alcoholism in a way where you can see how worn down he's become through a constant battle with his inner demons.

But unfortunately we don't get to explore this side of Danny in too much detail, as just when Danny appears to be getting his life back on track a girl who also has the ability to shine named Abra, played by Kyliegh Curran, approaches him. She needs help dealing with a cult known as the true knot. They're an ancient organisation who preys on ""gifted"" children to absorb their life in an attempt to gain immortality and are led by a woman named Rose, played by Rebecca Ferguson, who takes sinister joy in creating fear and pain for the young children she kidnaps since she says that it makes them taste better.

Though whilst Ferguson's performance is entertaining, the surrounding history doesn't carry the same weight as that of the Overlook hotel. You would expect that the idea of these characters who have lived potentially millenia would carry some interesting backstories, but there's little depth with most members of the group hardly even getting any dialogue.They also end up being taken care off so easily that it left me wondering why they should have ever been considered a threat to begin with. And it's a big problem when the monsters of a horror film are neither scary nor interesting.

Also whilst the idea of Danny mentoring a young girl just like **** Hallorann did for him seems like it could be interesting, they seem to waste this potential since the girl never seems to need his help. Unlike Danny she doesn't seem detached from the world due to her powers and she's already seems more powerful than Danny so we don't see this dynamic explored.

Then of course there's the return of the Overlook hotel which was teased ever since the first teaser. The original Shining didn't try to rely on jump scares alone to create the Overlooks terrifying presence, instead it slowly built up the structure of the hotel through tracking shots and a dreadful sense of complete isolation. Then when it got to the end with all the spirits revealing themselves it's a hectic explosion of chaos delivering on some horrifying imagery. But here the hotel is just treated like a fun house only appearing in the last act of the film and having appearances of all the spirits crammed into the film without ever delivering on any actual scares.

Unfortunately the only element in the film which really comes close The Shining is the films score, which does a decent job of capturing the tone of the original theme. But outside of this the film just ends up feeling too scattered to be effective. There's not enough suspense to make for a good horror and there's not enough depth to provide us with a good character study. And in terms of capturing the spirit of the original film, unfortunately Ready Player One ended up being the more loyal portrayal."
2063,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/doctor-sleep/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Rebecca31,"Nov 8, 2019",6,"We didn’t really need another chapter to The Shining but we got one anyway so of course I’m going to see it. I’ve read the book and for those of you worried this will be another review where I criticise every detail and go on one of my rants about how the book is so much better, rest assured that’s not the case this time. Not only is Doctor Sleep a faithful adaptation but it’s entertaining and has more than enough creepy scenes to send a chill down your spine.

Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor) is all grown up and not exactly living his best life. On route to sort his life out he meets Abra, a young girl with a powerful shine. Danny must push aside his demons to protect Abra from a merciless cult, the True Knot who feed on children with the shining. Doctor Sleep keeps the dark tone of the book and I absolutely loved the casting choice of Rebecca Ferguson as Rose the Hat. She is the cold-hearted **** brought to life. It didn’t go overboard with the cheap jump scares, rather leaning into scenes that genuinely disturb you, all while maintaining the sinister atmosphere. Although I was enjoying the scenes recreated from The Shining it plays on your love of the original perhaps a little too much. I felt the time spent paying homage to The Shining was overdone. I liked the new direction Doctor Sleep was taking us so every time another recreation of The Shining cropped up it started to take me out of the film. This isn’t your typical horror, it’s scary in a whole other way. Setting out to frighten you not just by going real quiet only to have something jump at you from the dark while the music gets suddenly loud. The tension builds and you get more time for some character development. Director Mike Flanagan really did a good job with Doctor Sleep, I had my doubts after the trailer but as with many movie trailers these days, they don’t do the film any justice.

It’s no secret that Stephen King hated what Stanley Kubrick did with The Shining though I have to say I have a love for both the book and the film but I can understand why King didn’t like it at all. It wasn’t just a case of the book being better than the film, but they were both completely different to each other. I’m not even sure if Kubrick read all of The Shining, rather he took the general idea and put his own stamp on it. It feels like a Stanley Kubrick film, not a Stephen King film. Doctor Sleep is a completely different story, it stays true to its source material and is a much more faithful book to film adaptation. It feels like Stephen King and admittedly there’s been a few awful adaptations but when a Stephen King adaptation is done right it really is worth the ticket price. Recommended for all you horror fans."

The fact that their main goal while producing movies is to make some sweet, sweet cash is insulting to me. I guess they don't make the absolute worst animated movies, like 'Norm of the North'. Maybe the fact that my expectations were pretty low before watching this is the reason I found it semi-decent. Some of the songs I enjoyed. I mean, I was having a blast once Johnny was busting the keys for 'I'm Still Standing', but the final number was easily my least favourite. And I'm not a big 'Shake it off' fan either. However, I definitely enjoyed this more than 'The Secret Life of Pets', the animation is pretty good, and some of the characters are relatable, even if it feels like Illumination was trying to force some relatability with them. There's some talented voice actors in there, and it's funny enough, overall leading it to be a decent kill of 90 minutes. But I have many problems with this movie. Firstly, why are they animals? They could just as easily be people and the plot would not be different in any way. At least with Zootopia the plot was heavily dependant on the fact that they were all animals, but not here. I also found Buster Moon's financial problems uninteresting, and a lot of the character arks are predictable and mundane. It's also hard to flesh them out given the amount of them there are, with little to no character interaction. It's probably one of the best movies we've seen from this company, but let it be known that that is hardly an achievement."

​
Based around something as universally understood as music, Sing seems to be an appropriate first-time directing effort by the duo Christopher Lourdelet and Garth Jennings (who directed live action before). The result of their hard work brings a passable accomplishment by the studio’s sixth ever full-length feature, even if no studio gamechanger nonetheless.

The feature takes place in an unnamed San Fran-Los Angeles-esque city painted by Miami, home to many anthropomorphic mammals, reptiles, birds, primates, household pets, cephalopods, arachnids, and whales. We focus on six mammals: one a producer, five the lucky choices for his theater-saving singing competition. Plenty celebrity voices deliver occasionally terrific singing, although the minor roles’ unfitting voices draw back the overall quality. Surprisingly however, the anthropomorphic individuals’ subplots are all masterfully balanced in their yearnings on the road to fame and fortune:

Buster Moon the koala (Matthew McConaughey) wants to keep the theater financially stable after his father passed down the torch. Despite being the lead, he is the least interesting cast member, more existing to vocalize the cliché morals. Though he still plays great off the more colorful characters, including his dimwitted senior secretary, Miss Crawly the iguana.

Rosita the pig (Reese Witherspoon) wants to follow her passion away from her uncaring husband and twenty-five children. She soon meets unexpected challenges when the competition pairs her with an overly optimistic pig named Gunter. This widely marketed chunk of ham shockingly gets little stage time; and I should also mention how he flaunts an indistinguishable European accent exaggerated to the point of annoyance. The immature will worship him like Moccus, leaving adults to gag a bit while watching an overweight swine in a unitard stereotyping western culture.

Johnny the gorilla (Taron Egerton) wants to escape his father’s criminal lifestyle, and follow his heart for the microphone. Boys across all ages will relate to this highly soulful musician, despite a phoned in resolution to his subplot.

Ash the porcupine (Scarlett Johansson) seeks public appreciation alongside her boyfriend/musical partner. While her story feels relatively unengaging compared to the others, she still brings a nice voice, especially when her guitar strums electrify her quills to the point of showering out.

Mike the mouse (Seth MacFarlane) needs the prize money to pay back a bear gang who see him as a tasty meal. His ratty account maybe could have benefited from higher stakes against the law; but it does not matter anyway, for this crude comedian providing the voice amazingly makes a tiny crooner so ruggedly lovable with some spice thrown in.

Meena the elephant (Tori Kelly) cannot pursue her love for singing, as her glossophobia gets in the way, with no thanks to her arrogant grandfather. She has the most poorly balanced yet easily relatable experience for all the boys and girls facing a similar fear.

Together, doubt gets conquered in a unified walk to fame and fortune. So who ends up winning the competition?

It doesn’t matter! They are all too introspective to notice one another, as these well-rounded individual stories have zero interweaving amongst one another. In the end, Sing cares less about teamwork, and more about getting children to worship the most popular hits by Lady GaGa, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Carly Rae Jepsen, and everyone else out there (just stay through the credits, the list of songs used lasts over a minute). It doesn’t matter if the human artist singles are sung by cute little animals; accompanied by predictable fart jokes, evidence proves why this movie aims squarely toward kids with an affinity of music over rules, offering the parents nothing more than a few scattered chuckles to at least manage without booing the artist offstage."
2073,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sing/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,LeopoldTheBrave,"Apr 2, 2017",6,"I like this movie A LOT for some reason. I know it's only mediocre at best. But there's something that keeps making me come back to it. There's LOTS of positives, but a negative for each one.

For example, all the characters are very likable, but because there are so many, we barely get to spend a lot of time with them.

The movie is paced very well at the start, letting us get to know all the characters we'll be seeing throughout the movie. But it falls a bit at the end when it focuses a bit too much on Meena, the most generic of the lovable cast as she just plays the role of ""The shy girl.""

The animation is fantastic. There's a wide variety in character design, and the environment looks great. You can really see yourself in the city or town where the movie takes place. But that's also a problem. While it's pretty, it has no creativity. You could replace all the animals with humans, and they could live in this world perfectly fine. While I do prefer this movie over Zootopia's overly forced message, predictability, and mediocre characters, they at least got the creativity in the animation correct.

Overall, I find Sing to be a very enjoyable movie, but I am aware of its flaws. I'd definitely recommend it over Secret Life of Pets, Zootopia, or any other talking animal movie that came out in 2016. (Except Kung fu Panda 3. Nothing beats that. Ever.) Without borrowing the plot of Toy Story like Secret Life of Pets, or a forced message that reminds you how **** the world is for 100 minutes and makes you feel all melancholy like Zootopia, Sing is able to pull you into its happy world and distract you for a good bit. Not the kind of distraction that you'd sit your kids in front of to quiet them down for a while, but a good distraction that you'd enjoy watching with your kids to pass some time on a rainy day."

The story is simple, but not altogether predictable.  Not sure what the moral of the movie is, but I guess it would be to follow your dream no matter what.  If you're going to have a really simple story, then you should make the movie as funny as possible.  That's where the film fails for me.  I didn't laugh all that much.  It tries hard to be funny, and may succeed with small children, but not so much for adults.  The strangest part of the film is the Mom pig who creates an automated system for taking care of her large family while she is at rehearsals.  In a single night she creates a majorly complex auto feed, auto laundry system that would make NASA proud.  She needs to be an inventor, not a singer.  Not a horrible film, but could have been better."

What's it like?: It is like a combination of the backstage stories to reality TV singing competition shows such as American Idol and the written stories of TV series such as Glee, but with animals… much fewer animals than what was advertised in the trailer. It’s not original. Children and teenagers could be fooled into liking it due to its  numerous pop songs, but there is insufficient story and there are not enough good laughs. As a results, adults would find it middling.
>
Cons: >
1. For much of the film, it seemed like there was nothing special going on and that the film was merely propped up by the numerous recognisable pop songs. The last 20 minutes was much better, but even then there were only covers of pop songs apart from one new original song. Even so, that original song was not memorable.
>
2. One would think that the film would cover the long story behind each season of a reality TV singing competition show, but the potential number of ‘contestants’ were chopped down drastically at the first cut, to just seven acts! That seemed too few and too lacking in variety and talents. It was as if there was insufficient budget to get enough famous voice actors to voice for the animals! >
Pros: Cons #2 ends up being a master stroke. There could have been too many acts if the format of American Idol was followed. More is not always better. More could end up stalling the film by having one pop song come after another. With fewer ‘contestants’, the end of the film felt sharper and sooner, which is good. >
How would the different age groups rate it?
Children: Excellent.
Teens: Good.
Young adults: Average
Medium age adults: Average
Old adults: Average.

My rating: 3/5 (no half scores). Save you money and watch it on TV."

There's little genuine humor, but there is a touch of heart. On the other hand, there are LOTS of songs, some with spirited arrangements and good performances.

2086,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lizzie/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Bertaut1,"Jan 1, 2019",6,"Could do with a bit more vitality, but the acting is superb

Written by Bryce Kass, and directed by Craig William Macneill, Lizzie is based on the case of Lizzie Borden, who was accused and subsequently acquitted of the axe murders of her father and stepmother in Massachusetts in 1892. A revisionist take on the material, the film presents Borden as a protofeminist lashing out against patriarchal oppression, homophobia, and sexual assault. And although the languid pace will alienate many, whilst the liberties it takes with historical facts will irk others, there is much to praise here.

One of most interesting aspects of Lizzie is its narrative structure. Beginning on August 4 just as the (unseen) bodies are discovered, it then flashes back six months to the arrival of housemaid Bridget Sullivan (Kristen Stewart), building up to August 4 again. This time we see the bodies, but not the murders. It then jumps forward to the trial, before once again flashing back to August 4, this time showing us the actual killing. This structure allows the film to briefly cover the trial, whilst still employing the murders as the dénouement. It also allows the narrative to build tension around an event which the audience already knows is coming.

Aesthetically, Noah Greenberg's cinematography is particularly laudable. The film rarely ventures outside the Borden house, with the photography giving rise to a restrictive and claustrophobic mise en scène. Often framing Borden in windows, doorways, and behind railings, whilst using shallow focus to flatten backgrounds, the sense is that this is a woman living a confined life with little room to move. When she first kisses the maid, Bridget Sullivan (Kristen Stewart), the camera pulls back to reveal that Lizzie's father Andrew (Jamey Sheridan) is watching them - even in this moment of release, they are still trapped in his domain.

Assisting Greenberg's photography is Ruy García's sound design. Of particular note are the floorboards, which creak with the slightest touch, making any kind of clandestine interaction between Borden and Sullivan virtually impossible, and thus contributing to the sense of the household as a prison. Enhancing this even further, is the lack of aural warmth, with footsteps and voices echoing and bouncing off the walls due to the lack of soft surfaces.

As a narrative of female empowerment (albeit of the homicidal variety), most of the film's main themes relate to combating the patriarchal strictures of the Gilded Age, represented primarily by Andrew, his brother-in-law John (Denis O'Hare), and his wife Abby (Fiona Shaw), who reinforces patriarchal hypocrisy by unquestioningly submitting to it. Presenting Borden as a woman driven to her wit's end, with few practical options in a society that looks down on her because she is unwed and in her 30s, the film depicts a free-spirit living in a cage, yearning for agency, a protofeminist actively rebelling against the dominion of men. Presenting her and Sullivan's relationship as an illicit romance which they had to hide because of the moral bigotry of the age, the film adopts a #MeToo sensibility, as they fight back against self-righteous judgement, unchecked abuse, and socially sanctioned oppression.

There are, however, some sizeable problems. For one, the film lacks energy, and the slow pacing will leave some viewers bored to tears. Additionally, apart from Sevigny and Stewart, the rest of the cast is wasted. Perhaps the most egregious problem, however, is that the film seems as war with itself. On the one hand, it wants to be an elegant, period-appropriate tale of women attempting to take their destinies into their own hands, but on the other, it wants to present a modern story of murder and homosexual women. At times, such as the superb depiction of the murders themselves, you can feel the modern sensibilities rise to the surface, but for the most part, they're stifled by the hushed austerity of a more muted milieu. Additionally, Kass's script tips the scale in Borden's favour too much (Andrew is not just an authoritarian homophobe, but a rapist; there's also John's creepy intimations, Abby's refusal to stand up for her step-daughters, and Borden's protofeminist humanitarianism). Weighing the scales so decisively drains the film of ambiguity and much of its vitality, presenting a binary story of righteous good slaying hypocritical evil, rather than a murder with many facets. Lizzie tells the story of an initially powerless victim who lashes out and, quite literally, slays patriarchal authority. A Gothic tale told from a #MeToo perspective, it tries to be many things at once - a revisionist history, a feminist tract, a championing of homosexuality, a murder mystery, a period drama - but ends up kind of falling into a no man's land between genres. Still though, there are aspects that are enjoyable, if you can look past the enervating pace."

That's the angle of this latest take on notorious axe murderer Lizzie Borden. Chloë Sevigny plays the frustrated daughter with her typically flat delivery. The combination of her amorous relationship with the house maid (Kristen Stewart) and the increasingly cruel actions of her father drive her to the legendary hacking. There's a lovely period ambience that's echoed by the subdued period pacing. While danger bubbles under the surface, it never builds to any sort of boiling point. Somber and subdued makes for an interesting story, but not much of an emotionally compelling one."

Lucky for me Netflix picked it up and released it on my birthday. I went in with decent expectations and I was mostly satisfied.

Suddenly they find themselves on the run after a supposed cop commanders his car and runs down a man. Fearful they will be blamed for the murder they flee and than try and solve the crime as they run from the increasing group of criminals and cops.

I can say for a Netflix movie it isn't terrible. I know that is glowing praise, but if I were to pay to see this in theaters I would be less then generous to it. The Lovebirds is a romantic comedy where if you watch the trailer you have seen all the jokes basically. That is a huge problem that trailer had me thinking that this film was going to be a side splitting good time. Instead I got a passable comedy. I do mean it is passable due to the fact you will laugh at some of the jokes... but not many. The plot focuses on a couple who end up being accessories to a murder from a guy claiming to be a cop, and the comedy ensues. Some may find Kumail Nanjiani annoying due to how he is complaining the entire film. It didn't bother me, but be warned he is the exact character he was in Stuber.

This was a little hard to rate as the film equally has stuff I liked and disliked.

Jokes are hit-and-miss. The funniest parts are derived from investigating the mystery (we know who did it but not why.) Things can get dark, and it is at the sure unexpectedness of this darkness that the movie works best.

The jokes that don't work are often at the points that the focus is more on the personal lives of the characters, which isn't as strong. There is a conflict set up between the couple that never feels real enough. It doesn't help that the jokes are often stretched. So if you don't like one, expect it to go on for a while. There is a little too much observational humor and the characters overreacting to things.

Though they can't make the weak bit work, Rae and Nanjiani are good in this and have chemistry together.

I was on the fence about how I felt about this. I actually recommend you watch this because I feel that there'd be a good amount of people who'd prefer this more than me. Even if you don't like it, I think it's more likely to be a miss with you rather than something you outright dislike."

2099,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lovebirds/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Stream2BigScree,"May 23, 2020",6,"There is a typical comedy that seems to come out every summer that involves a couple in a rut, a strange turn of events, and its all resolved over the course of a crazy night out. Steve Carrell and Tina Fey romped through it as a boring married couple in Date Night. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams joked about in it as a buttoned-up couple in Game Night. Now, we have Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani in the Netflix premiere of The Lovebirds trading barbs as a couple at the end of their rope on this fateful night. If you have seen one of these movies, then you have seen them all; in these action/crime/romance comedies the entertainment value, chemistry of the leads and the humor determine whether they are worth the time. Let’s see how The Lovebirds fares.

For The Lovebirds, the premise is pretty basic and set forth in the trailer. Rae and Nanjiani play a bickering couple who have run out of patience for each other and have lost the excitement in their relationship. On one evening out in New Orleans, a policeman commandeers their vehicle and proceeds to murder a cyclist. Was that a real policeman? Is this couple now accomplices in this crime? Are they in danger and how do they prove they aren’t the criminals? Hijinks ensue.

The Lovebirds is directed by comedy vet, Michael Showalter, who previously directed Nanjiani in The Big Sick, which is a more thoughtful comedy available on Amazon Prime. It is a face paced movie. The catalyst event happens in the first 10 minutes, but from there, it does get a bit episodic but it moves at a good clip. As the couple follows the clues to the next set piece, the comedy doesn’t really ratchet up anything. We meet new characters and there a few surprises near the end, but those characters aren’t very memorable as they are just breadcrumbs along the way. The movie needs more tension or a heightening of reality because otherwise it doesn’t set itself apart for any others in this genre.

The chemistry between Rae and Nanjiani is good though. Each plays a modern archetype. Rae is the image obsessed woman who works at a marketing firm and her boyfriend isn’t exciting enough for her. Nanjiani is the straight-laced, documentary filmmaker who’s jealousy bubbles just beneath the surface. There is a meet-cute between Rae and Nanjiani early on that doesn’t really show why they are in this relationship, but the back-and-forth between the two works and is funny throughout the film. Without these two, this film would have been boring noise just to play in the background. I can’t say that the film itself is funny, but the leads do their best to make the most of it.

Ultimately, if this movie were in the theaters, I would say wait until it is on some streaming service. In our current climate, since The Lovebirds has premiered on Netflix, it is a decent film to watch on a casual night at home. Grab a bowl of popcorn. Curl up with your boo and see if you would make it through this hellacious night unscathed. Besides it is less than 90 minutes, you have that time – I know you do."

And although many times it's said that the journey is better than the destination, in this case it's not so because the journey despite being built with respectable quality, never rises above the average."
2103,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/on-the-basis-of-sex/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,MarkHReviews,"Jan 12, 2019",6,"One would think “On the Basis of Sex” would have the inside track for offering the definitive take on Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  After all, the screenplay was written by Ginsburg’s nephew, Daniel Stiepelman, whose script was discussed, reviewed and edited by Ginsburg and her daughter, Jane.  Despite this inside information and the artistic license granted this fictionalized version of Ginsburg’s life, the resulting movie does not compare favorably to last year’s more comprehensive, more powerful documentary “R.B.G.”

It’s curious that the film focuses so narrowly – a few scenes of Ginsburg at Harvard Law, her early days in NYC beginning in 1959 and an emphasis on her first major gender equality case, Moritz v. IRS, which was argued before the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in 1972.  Between 1973 and 1976, Ginsburg argued six gender discrimination cases before the US Supreme Court, five of them successfully.  One wonders why the film focuses solely on the beginning of her work on gender equality, while giving no real attention to the legal precedents she helped create for women over succeeding years.  For many, it is Ginsburg’s relentless pursuit of gender equality, accomplished case by case, brick by brick, that has made her so admired.  However, this narrow focus does allow the film to paint a painfully vivid picture of the barriers she had to overcome.  According to this film, women didn’t just cope with glass ceilings, in many cases they lived in glass cages.

In general, the cast is first-rate.  As Marty Ginsburg, the ever-supportive spouse, Armie Hammer taps into the same thoughtful, soulful character for which he received a Golden Globe nomination last year for “Call Me By Your Name.”  At key points, Cailee Spaeny, as Ginsburg’s daughter Jane, offers a refreshingly in-your-face activism and assertiveness.  Jane’s personal power shows clearly that the gift of independent thought and capacity to question everything – which RBG received from her mother – was passed on to the next generation.  Unfortunately, Felicity Jones in the lead role just seems out of place.  Jones was wonderful as Stephen Hawking’s wife in “The Theory of Everything” (2014).  Here, she seems to be laboring to tone down her irrepressible perkiness.  Or, perhaps, it’s just that RBG, in this rendering, is just so humorless.

The film is particularly incapable of treating the traditionalists who oppose feminism as anything other than bad caricatures.  In one early scene, Law School Dean Erwin Griswold (Sam Waterston) invites the nine female member of the incoming class to dinner at his home.  Once seated, he asks each to introduce herself and explain why she is taking the place of a deserving man.  It all comes across with the subtle nuance of Gallagher hitting a watermelon with a sledgehammer.

Many years ago, I recall my father, a thoughtful, decent man, saying that he would be willing to help fund higher educator for his granddaughters “should they prove educable.”  From today’s perspective, it’s jarring to think about that stereotype permeating the thinking of reasonable people.  As much as any other individual today, Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been responsible for changing that point of view.  Unfortunately, “On the Basis of Sex,” fails to do her justice."
2104,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/on-the-basis-of-sex/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Jan 7, 2019",6,"On the evening news they announced, that for the first time in her 25 years as a Supreme Court Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg would miss hearing oral arguments but would read all the notes taken and vote as was expected of her. After two operations for cancer and bouts of chemo she still shows the fortitude that saw her through a life of having to prove herself.

""On The Basis of Sex"" opens with Ginsberg attending a class of Harvard Law School, only one of nine women in a class of more than 500 men. We see the happy and equal, possibly more equal for her, marriage with her loving, smart husband who knows his wife can do anything she wants and he is there to back her up. For the first hour of the film we see had badly women were treated in the work force, along in many other aspects of everyday life, the comfortable marriage of the Ginsbergs, their children of which the oldest is a daughter who seems to motivate her mother to go a step further than she might be ready to go and how it lead to the Supreme Court.

It is in the last 45 minutes that we see Ginsburg in 1975 arguing her first case regarding gender equality but it is for a man, not a woman, who as a caretaker for his mother has been denied $296 as a tax deduction.

""On The Basis of Sex"" is written by Ruth Bader Ginsberg's nephew, Daniel Stiepleman, but as much research as I did I wasn't able to find out who his parents were but he obviously admired, if not worshiped, Martin and Ruth Ginsburg so both are presented as perfect people.

Felicity Jones as Ruth Bader Ginsburg really has a one note role but adds what she can to it. Anyone who saw last years documentary ""RBG"" or has seen her interviewed knows the lady is certainly not a one note person. Armie Hammer, as Martin, is excellent as the man who believes in his wife while Cailee Spaeny does a standout job as their teenage daughter Jane.

Though it is hard, at first, to accept Sam Waterston as the hard, condescending Dean of Harvard Erwin Griswold, he is just one of the men who thought as he did, including the 3 judges who hear Ginsburg's gender discrimination case.

Along with Hammer, Justin Theroux, as a ACLU lawyer, and Christian Mulkey, as the defendant in the  case, are effective in playing the 'good guys'.

Kathy Bates in the role of Dorothy Kenyon, an early civil liberties fighter, lawyer and judge, shines in her two scenes.

The director, Mimi Leder, does a by the numbers job and somewhere along the line the production staff saw a 'blue' New York. Clothes, signs, lights, door fronts, let alone Ginsburg's major outfit, is blue!

""On The Basis of Sex"" is an enjoyable love story, an interesting gender civil rights lesson, but most of all it shows how a person, a woman, lead a successful life in spite of all that was thrown in her way and gave us a woman who today is admired by many, including her enemies who want to get her off the Court which is a compliment.

I recommend a double bill movie night of ""On The Basis of Sex"" for a Hollywood version of Ruth Baded Ginsburg and ""RBG"" to discover who the woman was yesterday and is today."

Or à la suite d'un concours de circonstances impromptu, voilà-t-y pas qu'il flingue le fiston très con de son parrain... pour protéger son fiston à lui qu'il ne voit plus depuis des années !

Alors, pensez donc, le parrain a beau être un pote de 30 ans de notre pauvre Liam, il n'en est pas moins super vénère : il réclame sa tête mais aussi celle de son fils (le fils de l'alcoolo irlandais -pléonasme-, j'espère que vous suivez quand même) parce qu'il est du genre ""dent pour dent"" et qu'en plus il a la dent dure, le vieux mafieux.

Et putain, il est vieux le parrain incarné avec aplomb par Ed Harris, dans les 80 piges au compteur environ mais on ne compte plus à cet âge-là. D'ailleurs, notre grand Liam ne se fait plus tout jeune lui non plus et le retraité enchaîne les bastons et les fusillades comme un jeune chien fou dans un jeu de quilles. Papy, tu vois, il envoit du bois.

Un flicard a aussi la dent dure à son égard, joué par Vincent D'Onofrio, préretraité ou presque, vétéran de ""New York section criminelle"", mais également le marquant ""Engagé Baleine"" de... Full Metal Jacket ! oué ça remonte à... pffiou !

Attendez, ce n'est pas terminé, un autre Papy fait une apparition, quasi-fantomatique : on dirait Dieu le père en personne, environ 90 balais... ouais, c'est bien Nick Nolte, vous ne rêvez pas ! il m'a fait peur.

Alors le film qui se déroule surtout la nuit se veut un modèle de rédemption des truands à qui on apprend plus à faire la grimace... et bien sûr la rivalité de deux fortes personnalités qui se respectent mais s'affrontent à cause des circonstances. Certes, ce n'est pas Heat mais on sent une inspiration assez nette à cet égard.

Si l'histoire tient ma foi tout-à-fait debout, elle titube sensiblement dans la psychologie de ses personnages trop exagérée, trop forcée et le scénario qui aligne poursuites et bastons sans crier gare est du même acabit : on se sent un peu trop souvent dans une stathamerie ou autre production Luc Besson, ce qui n'est pas un compliment, non, non...

Pour autant, on ne s'ennuie jamais là-dedans et nos vieux donnent le meilleur d'eux-mêmes, Liam et Ed en premier : leur expérience crève l'écran. On passerait même l'éponge sur le caractère outrancier du film si sa réalisation était au moins à la hauteur, ce qu'elle n'est pas avec son montage cut et zoomé, rendant l'action confuse et désordonnée.

Il reste un film pas désagréable avec quelques moments touchants mais globalement dépassé par son ambition : la rédemption du truand est en effet un sujet difficile et délicat qui ne souffre pas la médiocrité... Trop emporté, Night Run n'a pas acquis la sagesse nécessaire."

The story is typically inane and pointless, but Run All Night balances that with its furious pace and tension, well shot and decently choreographed fight scenes, and its above average performances from the cast, if not from Neeson himself, whose acting skills continue to fail in convincing me that he ever cares about anyone he's trying to save."

Overall, I liked this movie, and I think it represents a decent ending to the Bridget Jones trilogy. It's not a very good movie, but it's warm, it has a funny story and gives us back most of the characters we like. Personally, I like this movie more than its predecessor, which seemed more worn and soulless. In this movie, the unthinkable happens and Bridget got pregnant… but she doesn't know who the father is! On the one hand, it could be Mark Darcy, her eternal love, but it could also be Jack, a one-night stand she had at a festival.

The movie is predictably the last in which we'll see Bridget Jones and her adventures. Not only is the formula already quite worn out, but the actors have also aged and are now on another level of their lives. The biggest problem with this film, in fact, is the predictability of its script, where we can foresee with some certainty what will happen. Even who is the child's father! The jokes are nothing new, but sometimes they work, and the film is not happy about making us laugh, but it also doesn't upset us either. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the same chemistry among the trio of main actors that was observed in the past. The film has a series of uninteresting sub-plots, placed to fill time and space, because nothing relevant comes from any of them.

Again, Renee Zellwegger returns to one of the characters that brought her notoriety and fortune, but the actress already accuses her age, with visible wrinkles and a lack of joviality that the character also gradually assumes. She is a good actress, however, and gives us another very competent job, closing in the best way her work. At his side, a mature but elegant Colin Firth remains fresh and impeccable in the role of Darcy. Cast in this film, Patrick Dempsey did a satisfying job, but somewhat lukewarm, as was his character, an algorithmic intellectual who made his fortune with a social networking site. Emma Thompson is a good comedian, but the character is too serious for her to really put to use the comedic skills we recognize in her. Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent are safe bets, but they are rarely really taken advantage of. Sarah Solemani is also a nice addition, but also adds little to the film.

Once again, the film takes on its British credits with a discreet but effective and functional cinematography, making the best use of the good scenery and also the excellent filming locations selected for the film. We have a good balance of light and shadow, good colors and excellent editing, with the film not wasting time or dragging. The costumes are also very good, and the soundtrack does its job well, without standing out or disappointing."

Helen Fielding’s down-to-earth 20/30/40-something creation is back, still struggling with life, and about to embark on her most extravagant adventure yet – a baby, whose paternal genes she’s not quite sure.

What did I think?

Let me start with a disclaimer – I hate Renee Zellweger in this role. I loved the books, and always thought the casting was deeply offensive to legions of great British actresses – her ridiculously twitching terribly-accented Bridget did nothing for me. Surprising, then, that I found this sequel to be rather good. Zellweger’s now utterly-toxin-ravaged face is difficult to watch, and she still overplays Jones obscenely, but there are some seriously funny – proper “pah!” LOL moments – and some brilliant turns from Colin Firth, Patrick Dempsey and, particularly, Emma Thompson as the obstetrician who, God bless her, is aging beautifully (i.e. naturally).

It drags a bit – two hours?? – but it’s got just enough of the good stuff to keep you going, thanks in no small part to Fielding’s work on the screenplay and Shazzer picking up the director’s reins once again. I’m shocking myself by saying this, but it’s worth a watch!"

She is thinner than before, has a good job as a TV producer and without any prospects in the romance department. One of her past suitors, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) has died and she broke up with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) who got married.

As only as movies can do it Mark reappears in her life just as a new man Jack Qwant (Patrick Dempsey) appears, she goes to bed with both (NO! Not at the same time!) and guess what happens! (Read the title of the film folks!) We, she and they spend the next hour and a half (out of 2 hours) trying to figure which one is the father. Yes there is an easy way to find out who the father is but then there would be no movie.

Should you not be able to figure out who the father is by the scene in the Italian restaurant you haven’t seen a lot of movies.

Zellweger’s British accent gets a little too heavy at times, Dempsey seems to never have shaved during the movie constantly having that ugly 5 o’clock shadow and Firth’s saving grace is that he holds back with the smiles so when he shows one he lights up the film.

The supporting cast does their job and the film provides a few, very few, laughs, some slapstick and almost no feelings.

Kevin Spacey being cast as Richard Nixon was a perfect fit. Michael Shannon as Elvis was a odd choice but Michael is a great actor and he pulled it off. The movie was surprisingly very funny.

2129,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/elvis-nixon/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,ScarlettMi,"Nov 23, 2016",6,"This movie is saved by the strength of Michael Shannon's performance. Kevin Spacey is good as well, but if it weren't for the deep sense of melancholy that surrounds Shannon's Elvis, I don't think the film would have had any weight to it at all.

There are a couple of chuckles to be had here and there based around the absurdity of the life that Elvis leads and the juxtaposition of him and Nixon. Certainly that has to be part of the reason why the picture of the two of them that inspired this movie proves so popular. The way Elvis disarms and interacts with Nixon made for an entertaining exchange. Neither man comes across as very relatable but we can understand why they might relate to one another.

The movie never really takes off, but in the end it does work to paint a sad and affecting portrait of Elvis. I haven't checked, but it felt as though it was adapted from a stage play. Whenever Michael Shannon was given the opportunity to just talk for a bit, the movie was at its strongest. I also thought the relationship with Jerry was well done in showing what it would be like to live alongside someone who constantly **** up all the oxygen in whatever room he's in but still makes you feel special for having been there.

It's a solid character study of Elvis but whenever the story veers away from Shannon, the film gets weaker."

Much more in-line with the original film, to the point that nothing is mentioned of the wacky sequel, Cars 3 is a natural, role-reversing progression of the themes presented during the franchise's first lap. It can be blunt and obvious, but at heart this is a kid's movie and I appreciate the effort to mix a little extra meaning into the destruction derbies and Hot Wheel paint jobs.

The whole package looks great, as one might expect from a major Pixar effort. There's a ton of variety in the scenery, which is just stunning (the cars themselves occasionally seem glaringly flat by contrast), and the race scenes (particularly McQueen's big crash at the end of the first act) are vivid enough that you'd be forgiven for overlooking the giant eyeballs behind each windscreen.

I wouldn't place it in the pantheon of studio greats, but it's at least a deserving successor to Cars 1, if not an essential conclusion to that story. They could've just doubled down on Tow Mater and his international slapstick hijinx, raked in the bucks and called it a day, but instead we received something a little more contemplative and deserving of a feature-length.

2142,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars-3/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,DegenerateKeith,"Dec 11, 2023",5,"Cars 3 maintains Pixar's high animation standards, with polished visuals that gleam like a freshly waxed paint job. The racing sequences are particularly well-executed, capturing the speed and intensity of the track. However, it's not a groundbreaking leap forward from the first film, feeling more like a pit stop for the animation studio rather than a triumphant return to form.

Soundtrack:
Now, the soundtrack. Much like the first film, ""Cars 3"" sticks with a country-tinged sound, bringing back the familiar tones of Americana. While it may not reach the heights of Pixar's best musical offerings, it complements the film's racing theme and provides a steady backdrop without becoming a distracting pit crew member.

Story and Characters
Let's talk about the narrative. ""Cars 3"" brings Lightning McQueen back into the driver's seat, but this time he's facing the inevitable: aging and newer, sleeker models. The film attempts to explore themes of mentorship, legacy, and the passage of time, injecting some much-needed depth into the series. However, the narrative feels somewhat formulaic, hitting familiar beats that we've seen in countless sports movies. It's like they took a page from the underdog playbook and followed it to the letter.

Themes
Now, the themes. Cars 3 tries to deliver a message about the importance of passing the torch, but it occasionally veers into overly sentimental territory. 

The film's attempt to balance nostalgia with a fresh perspective is commendable, but it doesn't quite achieve the emotional resonance of Pixar's more impactful **** the grand Pixar spectrum, ""Cars 3"" is a respectable comeback after the wrong turn of ""Cars 2."" It steers the franchise back towards the emotional resonance that Pixar is known for, even if it doesn't break any new ground. 

It's a solid conclusion to the trilogy, giving Lightning McQueen a fitting farewell lap. It's a competent sequel that puts the series back on track, but it lacks the innovative spark of Pixar's best work."

Cars 3 has amazing animation (as expected from Pixar), a generic but decent plot with actual conflict this time, having Lightning McQueen now struggle to stay relevant against a new generation of hi-tech racers. It has decent writing and it feels like this was an ""apology letter""  to Pixar fans, this is noticeable with the fact that Mater now has like a couple of minutes of screen time. The worst character of the last film, barely appears in this movie, thank God. I have some problems with the story and characters, like the way this ends, the ending was extremely predictable and hilariously ridiculous. Some characters from the previous movies (besides Mater) barely have any screentime, serve no purpose to the plot and feel like shoehorned in and the new characters lack development or charisma, they are pretty forgettable.

This is obviously not a great movie, it's actually decent and has a purpose in the story of the franchise. I enjoyed the movie and it isn't anything too memorable or something I would rewatch."

Granted, the film does bring a few decent aspects to the table that keep it from just barely not sinking to the level of the second film. For one, it doesn't even mention the second film or contain a single character from that one at all (thankfully). Second, it does something that truly surprised me in a rather good way. Paul Newman, who voiced Doc Hudson in the first film back in 2006, and also sadly passed away two years later in 2008, had his voice featured in this film from recorded dialogue from the first film that went unused. Therefore, one of my favorite aspects from the first film was focused on more, which was Newman's voice talent and Doc Hudson's relationship with Lighting McQueen. That was truly a pleasant surprise for me that I so wish would've been enough to redeem the rest of this film for me, because aside from these positive standouts that I've mentioned, the rest of the film felt very uninspired and lazy, especially story-wise (if you've seen Rocky 3, you've basically kind of already seen this too). Overall, its few positive aspects, as well as the endearing and final return of Newman's voice talent made this a decent comeback effort from Pixar on behalf of the embarrassing second film, but it simply wasn't enough to save the rest of the film and its story unfortunately."

Lightning may come off as a jerk but he was being controlled like a puppet on strings from Cruz and Bop Cutlass. Mater is like breath of fresh air during the movie which is surprising because he was why the 2nd Cars was so bad. Overall this movie is just a cash grab and really didn't need to happen.

I have never seen the original television series, but I came across and found it interesting to try, only to realise in my watch that it was not what I thought of it. Yeah, definitely my disadvantage was that I didn't know the characters, the universe and all the basics. Those who loved the show might enjoy it better, since they know what to expect from it. I was like looking for a proper intro. The introduction of everything, as I'm not familiar with anything out of it. But it did not come, the story just went on and on from the opening itself. I was confused what's going on, who is who and et al.

It took almost half of the film to be comfortable with the scenario of the tale. Once I was there, I thought it was funny in places, yet I did not feel like to have a laugh. Again, I blame myself for missing out the fun for not knowing them very well. It never occurred to me before. I have seen many films that proceeded by its television series which I haven't seen. It looked short and the pace was excellent, so I did not get bored, except not getting the overall film properly. Otherwise, I would have rated it better. I think the people like me should be careful while picking it. Other than that it is an okay film, not a bad film.

2165,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/absolutely-fabulous-the-movie/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,madmovieman,"Nov 29, 2016",5,"It’s very rare for a sitcom to really translate well onto the big screen, and this is unfortunately yet another example. Whilst I think the original Ab Fab series is great fun, this feature-length edition a good decade and and a half later on from the original run’s end is far from any of the laughs that made the show so fun. With a dull screenplay and poor comedy (not to mention the cardinal sin of celebrity cameos), Absolutely Fabulous The Movie is anything but.

Now, the biggest issue with the film is that it’s just not that funny. I’ll admit there are a couple of laughs here and there, but nothing hugely memorable or good enough to get you in the mood for a great comedy. In the show, so much of the humour came from Patsy and Eddie’s excessively narcissistic personalities, as well as their unorthodox relationship with Saffy, Eddie’s daughter.

However, rather than being able to laugh at all of that, this film makes all of the show’s best qualities simply irritating. Similarly to a couple of revival episodes over the past few years, the film is a consistently underwhelming and irritating watch, because it rehashes old jokes again and again, and also indulges itself in the modern era in a way that doesn’t suit its characters or situation at all. It’s a format that seemed to work back in the 90s, but doesn’t translate well into the present.

Whilst Joanna Lumley, Jennifer Saunders and Julia Sawalha all put in the same shifts as they did in the original show, the script here just means they’re not as entertaining. The predictability of so many of the jokes right from the start makes everything feel so lacklustre, and it’s very difficult to keep interested or hopeful over the course of 90 minutes, instead of 30.

This film is in general a big mess. The script’s comedy is very poor, and the story isn’t much better, featuring a billion conveniences just to get the characters into ‘hilarious’ situations. It used to feel so organic and simple, but the plot here feels incredibly manufactured and predictable, another hugely disappointing element.

And then, there’s the nail in the coffin: the celebrity cameos. Of all the worst things a film can do, this always shows a script that’s got no ideas, and is simply relying on an equivalent of fan service to get laughs out of you. In a horribly similar way to this year’s other celebrity overdose, Zoolander 2, Ab Fab The Movie keeps throwing hordes of celebrities at you in an attempt to mask the script’s complete lack of comedic class, but it never works, and makes for an even more dull and underwhelming watch.

Overall, I thought that this was a really disappointing film. With so much talent coming from the original series, this film is perfect evidence of how a sitcom doesn’t work stretched to 90 minutes, thanks to its dull, unoriginal screenplay, poor comedy, and excess of celebrity cameos."

There are dozens of cameos, but if you're not up on English pop culture many may go unappreciated. The costumes are wonderfully over the top.

Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah, to be specific, with a whole slew of freshly-concocted secondary beasts stomping around in the background.

These fresh takes on a familiar trio are bold and beautiful, magnificent updates on a timeless set of character designs. Matched with an impressive elemental tone-setter or two - Ghidorah enveloped by a swirling thunderstorm, Rodan birthed from the belly of a volcano, Mothra hibernating beneath the veil of a misty waterfall - the monster effects are breathtaking; foreboding, painterly and mythical in their execution. The expertly-directed promo posters that preceded this film’s release were no ruse. The entire movie looks that good. A shame, then, that the story couldn’t have been better.

Even by old-school Godzilla standards, this one’s a stinker. It shouldn’t take much effort to shift the scene from one preposterous slice of movie mayhem to another, but King of the Monsters makes the job look awfully tough. From flimsy talking points to one-dimensional characters, plot cartwheels to scientific hand-waves, it’s a universal phone-in. If the assumption is that nobody’s come to watch the little people run around and stress over the monsters, that’s correct. That doesn’t mean we won’t notice when their motivations stop making sense and their master plan is strung together with scotch tape and twine. I wanted to love it, and when I managed to stop thinking and gape at the big guys, I did. But that was only true about fifty percent of the time. Hence, half-credit."

Whenever a cool monster fight was going to happen or continue, they switched to boring human storyline of the main guy yelling and being silly. I do not have any care for the humans in this film... they have no redeeming qualities. The monsters should be the lead of the films with the humans being a very minor part of it, not the other way around.
The musical score is pretty great. It's dramatic and intense in a good way. I kind of expect this when titans are fighting in a movie so good job.

My friend is a huge fan of kaiju movies and he showed me the trailer of this movie when it first came out. I was struck in awe. I couldn't believe something so legendary looking was actually going to be made while I live. The poster and promotional materials were also looking so much filled with fantasy. I watched the 2014 Godzilla to watch this. If you've seen my review of that movie, you will know how much I loved it except for the human part. But when I watched this movie, I was very dissatisfied.
The problem that plagues Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the humans. First of all they are talking so much. The whole time all we see is talking, talking and even more talking. First Madison and her mother are talking, then the army is talking, then the eco terrorists are talking. And finally when Godzilla and Kong Ghidorah finally start fighting, then seen cuts to the humans running. Look, I have no problem with humans being shown in Godzilla movies. But it should be like the 2014 movie, where humans are only shown when the monsters are walking and not during the fights.
The human plot of this movie is very pathetic. The eco terrorists had a point and I completely agreed with them, but as it was shown how they are supposed to be the bad guys was not very surprising. I have never understood movies which villify eco-terrorists. Like, why don't they ever explain why they are supposed to be bad? Take a moment, think about valid points and just speak them out. It doesn't have to be ""you're the bad guy boo-hoo!"". This only makes us feel like the bad guys won.
The CGI, however, is where this movie is an absolute win. I will give it full marks for that. I just love all the fight scenes from it. When Rodan seemed to have killed Mothra I was feeling very bad for her, but seeing how she made a comeback was very surprising. The part where Rodan and King Ghidorah fight the planes was also very cool. I really wanted to show that scene to someone else (sadly I'm the only person who is interested in Monsterverse and those who are interested already watched the movie before me).
Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a movie that completely tested my patience. It was fun, I'm gonna remember all the monster scenes, but I don't think I'm ever gonna have the courage to watch this ever again. Some things are best left in memory, and that's what I'd say about this movie. It's a good thing Godzilla vs Kong removed the bad parts and made what we wanted to see. That's how this franchise is supposed to be, not like this one."

This film is visually stunning, and it's one of the most Incredible looking films I've seen in a long time. But it's not helped by the fact it's got very little action between scenes of human drama scenes. And the action that is there is pact mostly at the end of the movie. Remember the sequences of the monsters shown in trailers? That was literally all the scenes we got of the monsters. There were no other scenes of the monsters in the film after that. I wish there was more instances in the film where Godzilla was fighting other monsters. Maybe have an arc where he is recruiting other monsters to fight alongside him in the climax, and not just Mothra.

But yeah, overall this film fell slightly below average for me. That doesn't mean it's a bad film! Feel like I always need to say that. It just means it has a lot to be desired, more so than other films that do the same things it does better and in more spades."

The trailer was so good that I decided to watch this movie in the theatre on day one in IMAX. However, I came out of it with a mixed thought towards it.

The biggest praise I have is that they used Godzilla monsters from Japanese movies. The MUTOs from Godzilla (2014) were fine but not memorable. Here the monsters are all different and unique. Mothra looks beautiful, Rodan looks scary and Ghidorah looks grand. They all have great monster designs that stick in your mind with Ghidorah looking like he could take on the legendary Godzilla. The CGI, visual effects and sound effects are all phenomenal too. Another big problem in Godzilla (2014) was the lack of Godzilla and that has been addressed. Godzilla appears way more and does a lot more fighting this time.

On that note, the action scenes are still exhilarating to watch. It is also better choreographed than the previous Monsterverse movies which mean more exciting titan action. Visually the movie is also gorgeous to look at thanks to the cinematography by ""Lawrence Sher"". Some stunning wide shots illustrate the massive nature of these Titans. The director also uses brighter colours, plus a lot of colour blue, compared to Godzilla (2014) which makes a lot of the scenes more visible including the action scenes. I also really loved the score by ""Bear McCreary"" who incorporates the classic themes in Japanese Godzilla into the movie. It elevates a lot of the scenes and makes them feel grander.

Unfortunately, the story is incredibly stupid and ridiculous. Previous Monsterverse movies had simple plots that just revolve around getting from point A to B with the monster story happening concurrently with the humans. However, here the humans play a central part in what is happening with the monsters causing the focus to be on the humans rather than the titular Godzilla. The main plot shoved in our face is the human family, the ORCA (a magical plot device that affects the Titans), and some eco-terrorist. The human family soap drama is genuinely dumb and the ORCA is constantly used to do whatever BS the plot requires. There are also some eco-terrorist and their plan is evil yet the movie somehow wants to justify their plan when it's dumb. These stories hog a lot of screen-time and it especially affects the pacing in the second act by spending too long on it that I was getting bored. It's made worse by the fact that the characters are no longer just uninteresting but downright hateable. Dr Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) is the main lead who lost his son because of these Titans and hates them including Godzilla. He gets an arc where he likes them more now because the plot needed him to be I guess? Dr Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is Mark's ex-wife who believes letting all the Titans wake up is going to be great for the world. Her plan is stupid and because of her a bunch of people died yet the movie still want the audience to feel for her. Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown) is Mark and Emma's daughter who sides with her mum but then changes her mind. None of these 3 main characters sounds remotely interesting but you're going to spend the most time with all these 3. There are also some other one-dimensional supporting characters including some from the original Godzilla (2014) but they are all incredibly bland as well.

On that note, the tone of this movie is quite comedic and more far-fetched compared to Godzilla (2014). Sadly none of the quips is very funny and it can even clash with the moments which are meant to be serious. For example, there is a scene where the human characters found something astonishing so a natural reaction is ""oh my god"" but then another character adds ""Zilla.."" to the end of it and I cringed from the stupidity of that line. There are a couple of other moments that feel like that and it just doesn't work. Some death scenes occur which the movie attempts to make sad but it doesn't work as the human characters are forgettable and it then gets overshadowed by jokes or dumb dialogue.

Overall, Godzilla King of the monsters is very silly and tries to incorporate a serious human story in it but fails miserably. Nevertheless, the visual effects and the monster battles are still great which in the end might be all that people want. After watching this though, I want a movie with better human characters though because the Monsterverse so far still can't provide it."

Countless easter eggs and nods both subtle and conspicuous pepper this film, constantly showing the love the director and his team have for this franchise as musical highlights from Toho's 60s and 70s blare loud and proud. It's a spectacle to behold, especially for fans, but unfortunately the end product is a bit like the 2005 King Kong: a bit too lovey for its own good. KotM has so many monsters, people, and references to cycle through that it has to move at a blistering pace, jumping from one scene to the next with almost no time at all to stop and let things sink in. Major plot points come and go in the blink of an eye with no explanation and character arcs both human and titanic are forced to play out in fast forward. The big epic fights that're meant to be the main attraction are constantly interrupted and obscured by rain, smoke, nightfall, and excessive color grading. The human characters who butt in and out of these big fights are thankfully more emotive, more memorable, and less obtrusive than the ones from the 2014 film, but the cast is far bigger than it needs to be and half of it seems to exist just to deliver Marvel-esque quips and one-liners, many of which fall completely flat. The main thing saving the film is its kaiju cast- all the monsters have been beautifully updated and redesigned and given distinct personalities that are allowed to shine through without any dialogue. They're genuinely fun to watch, even when they're poorly lit and interrupted, and the interactions between them are the real meat and potatoes of the film; as absurd as it sounds, simply cutting out all the human bits and giving them more screentime would've been much more entertaining. KotM isn't bad either objectively or for what it is (a simple drive-in popcorn flick) and it's hard not to smile at all the love poured into it, but ultimately it promises much, much more than it delivers, and depending on what you're looking for that can be either frustrating, disappointing, or both."

'Godzilla: King of the Monsters' didn't work for me. Sorry guys. I'm gonna be the odd one to say this, but I thought this was incredibly boring.

I re-watched the 2014 version back in May in preparation for this movie and after five years since I've seen it, it still holds up. The scale felt so grand and the overall experience is so epic. It's a shame the same can't be said for 'King of the Monsters'.

People have complied about the characters in the 2014 version, but nothing compares to these planks of wood. Holy **** they are so one note. I honestly couldn't care for the whole family dilemma. At least we had Bryan Cranston that brought an emotional hook in Gareth Edwards movie. Heck, the characters in the original weren't too bad.

The comedy between other characters is painfully unfunny and out of place. The writing is really bad and doesn't help any character development. Logical sense for these characters are non-existing.

The visual effects, sound work, and action scenes were all the main highlights of course. I love the concepts of each monster and how visual effect wizardry brought it to life. During the fights or whenever the monsters are about to clash was a lot of fun.

Everything **** so much.

Overall rating: Satisfying for some Godzilla fans, but doesn't live up to its predecessor."

Yeah, the humans characters were all pretty boring and dull and they kinda **** but that’s pretty much what all of the Godzilla movies are like. Most of them go like this: A monster shows up. Military and scientist people talk. A monster shows up. Military and scientist people talk. A monster shows up and maybe fights another monster. Repeat. Godzilla: King of the Monsters was pretty much a modern big-budget version of a classic Godzilla movie. Godzilla movies don’t appeal to everyone so this movie isn’t for everyone, but as a Godzilla fan I got my fix. It was so cool to see all the things I saw these monsters do in the old movies with modern effects. There were a ton of really cool references to the older movies, references to King Kong (which I’m so happy is just a part of the Godzilla universe now) and new monsters, not just the big four that were advertised! The story also had some pretty interesting themes and ideas having to do with environmental disasters, which is a fitting update for these movies. The age of the atomic bomb is over. What do these monsters represent today? The monsters were also surprisingly expressive, you could tell what they were thinking and feeling and they showed a lot of personality. There were some issues I had with the movie, it cuts away during the monster fights a bit too much, sometimes it focuses on the human characters for a little too long (the old movies rarely exceeded 100 minutes. This movie is over 2 hours.) and some of the fights were hard to see, but overall I think this is a solid Kaiju flick! If you aren’t a fan of Godzilla, I don’t recommend this movie. It technically isn’t a great movie. However, if you are a fan of Godzilla and love all the classics, I think you’ll get a kick out of it! I sure did, and I can’t wait until Godzilla vs. Kong!"

B-b-b-but muh monster fights! Please, Godzilla still feels like a side-character in his own movie and every time one of these titan fights starts to get interesting the camera cuts away to check back up on whatever the wishy-washy turds at Monarch are doing. Michael Dougherty can't make glorious destruction like Gareth Edwards can and the brief glimpses you do get of the action you came to see are obscured and clouded by environmental effects to the point where you might as well not be looking at anything.

All this stuff you all complained about in the 2014 film is still here yet you're excepting this time around because Godzilla has a few classic names to throwdown with? Nothing has actually improved. So sorry, but I'm gonna have to call you guys out on your crap with this one.

If anything, this a huge step back from what we got before. The writing is just terrible. Only marginally less stupid than Pacific Rim: Uprising, which still holds the title of dumbest Kaiju movie, King of the Monsters doesn't even make use of it's one potentially good idea of people trying to use the titans to reverse humanity's effects on the environment. Instead it's just watching a bunch of idiots constantly flip-flop on whether or not they want to kill Godzilla and company, while Kyle Chandler struggles to decide on whispering or yelling all of his lines. Like seriously guy, just talk normal. That's perfectly acceptable.

Between this and the ""talent"" hired to make the upcoming Godzilla vs. Kong, it looks like the MonsterVerse is trying to take advantage of what appears to be the DCEU's recent comeback and snag the crown of worst cinematic universe right off its head. A shame, because before this it was in the running with The Conjuring Universe to be the MCU's second. Now it looks like we may need to behead this false king. His castle has begun to crumble."

Here are the negatives. The script for this film is absolute garbage. The dialogue is so forced and unnatural that it makes you roll your eyes everytime someone talks which obviously is a large portion of the film. The characters are also a huge detriment to the film. They don’t have any personality and are defined by their “one character trait” which is a running problem in Warner Brothers Monsterverse. Unfortunately, this one character trait robs the audience for feeling an emotion towards character deaths in the film. Some of the action scenes aren’t amazing also. For some of the action scenes, I can’t tell what is going on or who is who because the camera is shaking around a lot. One final thing is that I feel Millie Bobby Brown wasn’t great in this film. I like her in Stranger Things but I felt like she just wasn’t trying. Here are the positives of the film. One major thing is that the sound design, sound editing, and musical score are phenomenal. The film sounds amazing. I believe that this film could be an early contender for Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing at the Oscars. The musical score is just outstanding to listen to. Most of the actors do a pretty good job even though they were given a terrible script. Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, and Ken Watanabe were standouts from the film. The other half of the action scenes are pretty good and it’s awesome to see huge monsters fighting each other. Most of the visual effects are really good especially the character designs. Godzilla, Ghidorah, Mothra, and Rhodan look incredibly lifelike. The cinematography is good but it’s nothing special. The tone throughout the film remains consistent and the film is paced pretty well. It starts fast and moves from each scene quickly. Overall, Godzilla: King of the Monsters has some amazing sound editing, editing, and score with great visual effects but lacks a good script or compelling characters. I give Godzilla: King of the Monsters a 6/10."

A couple of vibrant characters made the movie good (props to Bradley Whitford), but overall the movie was bland and boring with actors who looked like they'd never been on a movie before. Sad moments felt funny and comedic moments were just cringe-worthy. For a movie with such high production value, it was certainly lackluster. The CGI, even, was laughably bad; even compared to the 2014 Godzilla. I'm hoping for a more exciting take on Godzilla with the next movie.

I don't have a very high bar for action movies like this, so it's not like I'm cork sniffing over here. Armageddon was a better movie than this pile of patchwork narrative and inconsistency of thought. I felt like I was watching a fever dream of a movie because of how janky and disconnected the narrative was. Trying to understand what this movie is trying to do is like trying to stick your hand into water without getting wet.

There is nothing in the characters in this movie that makes me like or give a single **** about any of them. The destruction is so vast and unearned that I don't care if the whole planet burns. There is no interesting dynamic in how the monsters work. There is no one scene that I can think of that is so well defined either in recognizable scale or earned tension that I can even remember. It's like trying to attempt recollection of an extremely weird dream 3 hours after you had it. Time, distance, and size mean absolutely nothing in this movie. The monsters are big, but you get a feeling that their size is so variable that it it can be whatever they want it to be from one scene to the next that I'm surprised 12"" Godzilla doesn't pop out of a toilet bowl and burn someone's ****

The destruction is so vast that entire cities are laid to waste, yet main characters are implausibly spared even though they're right in the middle of the mess. I'm not even sure what Mothra's role in this movie was. This was the most expensive Mad-Libs movie I've ever seen because the only good thing about it was the CGI.

Independence Day is a good bad movie. I actually felt something when Randy Quaid sacrificed himself and flew up into the butthole of the spaceship. This was a hot mess of nonsense that had no pacing or coherence. You know when you try to wing it when you cook meal out of whatever's in the fridge and nothing complements anything else and comes out nothing like the way you expected it? That's what this movie felt like. If people liked this horrible crap and hated Batman vs Superman, I put their honesty of movie appreciation squarely in question. I can forgive that crap before I forgive this steaming pile of radioactive rambling nonsense. That was a terrible movie, but at least I didn't feel like I knew where it was going.

Seriously, to the reviewer who wrote ""This isn't a Shakespeare play. This isn't Driving Miss Daisy. It's GODZILLA."" and then gave it a f&*king 10... A TEN... I hate you and you need to stop sharing your opinions on movies. Some people are contrarians for the sake of being contrarians and I could accept that point of view if they gave it a 7 or 8, but to give this movie a 10, you are kind of a terrible person and screaming out loud for your opinion to never be trusted again. It's such an absurd disconnect between quality _on any level_ and reality that I just can't find any way to understand what kind of brain parasite must be controlling those people, let alone believe that's an honest opinion, outside of maybe doubling down on their decision to see this movie as a validation of their taste."

Well.. I didn't expect this from the MonsterVerse. They made two good movies - The 2014 Godzilla movie featuring a new and refurbished Godzilla and the 2017 rendition of King Kong set in the past on Skull Island. Both had an amazing star cast headlined by an even more amazing Titan.

King of the Monsters promised a plethora of well known monsters from the world of Godzilla. And it does give us that. King Ghidorah, Mothra, Rodan and another 12 to 14 more. The graphics are amazing especially on the big screen. Though Kong is mentioned, he does not make an appearance but they do setup up the Godzilla v Kong sequel quite cryptically. Where does the movie falter? Well, at everything else apart from the graphics. The worst part is the dialogues. Who wrote them? A 10 year old could have written something better. Better yet, you could have just cut the dialogues and given us only the monsters fighting for 2 whole hours. That would have been far more bearable despite being cliched to the core. Kyle Chandler has never been so cringe worthy. And to think he was part of Manchester By The Sea.

There is a point where the every actor on screen becomes unbearable. Vera Farmiga's (who is the go to person for any Warner Bros. Movie) intentions seem irritating, Millie Bobby Brown is better off in Stranger Things, Charles Dance was not required here, Thomas Middleditch is again another cringe-worthy addition and Ken Watanabe does what any honourable man would do when they are cast in such monstrosities. I actually feel sad for Godzilla. Poor guy has to save the human race from the mistakes they intentionally make (this includes the movie).

Unlike the original (2014), there is a lot more of the Titan screentime . Zilla gets considerable screen time. But it does not carry the impact of Gareth Edwards's 2014 version. There is a lot of history (pre-historic) regarding these Titans to be discovered. And I guess a movie on that would not hurt. King of the Monsters is like a B-movie with good visual effects."

I would say that the acting was terrible except that the actors really did not have a script, it feels like they made the big CGI action sequences first then tried to stitch them together with an improvised, clichéd, plot hole filled, nonsensical, incomprehensible plot.

The actors are all stereo types that we have seen so many times before, lazy writing from a lazy production team who have no imagination or care for the craft of film making.

I advise you to wait till this nonsense comes out on video and fast forward to the monster fights, seriously there is no point watching anything that happens between the fight scenes, indeed, the crap acting and contrived dialogue will make you sick.

Something else that is abundantly clear, they have seriously gone overboard with the fake reviews, I do not think I have seen so many fake bot / studio reviews.

In the end though, I would suggest renting instead of shelling out the cash to see this in theaters."

The scriptwriter was probably a 13 year old boy. There were so many plot holes that could have been fixed with only 1 extra day of critical thought. The CG was awesomely intense and the sound design even better - so it's great if you don't care about stupidity of the whole thing. I just wish I didn't have the same expectations as the first film. I couldn't care less about the one-dimensional human characters. They should have had more character development and less one-liners. Its a shame because this film had a lot of potential.

Godzilla by Gareth Evans was criticized enormously for taking the name of the mythical Kaiju and just showing it a few minutes. Even I criticize that. But now that the studio gave the monsters priority, it turns out that that wasn't what they wanted. So, how the **** do you please them?

Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for nuclear weapons. It had an important message at first and the human characters were never of weight in the stories. Let's be honest. While the original stories were a little better built, they were not impressive either. But that's a separate issue.

Godzilla: King of The Monsters has a laughable story. Motives and consequences are stupid. The story is way too problematic and dumb. Its biggest problem and obvious weakness lies in its own argument.
The criticism is not that the characters don't matter, it's that they should not matter in the first place.
The tragedy of Vera Farmiga's character is ridiculous and completely irrational. Her own grief is discredited when the film tries to centralize the drama in a family when millions of families die because of her actions. Where's the sense in it?

That's why the whole plot fails and the awakening of the titans doesn't correspond to anything more than human hypocrisy. Element that the same film mentions. The awakening of these monsters and therefore all the resulting mess wasn't made to heal the planet, nature didn't provoke it, but it was to satiate the ego of a depressive woman unable to deal with her personal trauma.

Doing that aside in the term of entertainment the film does delivers what was promised. Although not 100% as advertised.
Mothra and Rodan are almost useless to be honest. Both have their moment yes, but here the crucial confrontation is between Godzilla and Gidorah.

The visual effects are spectacular although it's incredibly annoying that once again all the fights occur almost in the dark. That saves money in the details of the CGI but unfortunately for that reason all the fights feel repetitive.

Godzilla: King of The Monsters is a weekend film. Turn off the brain and enjoy two basic hours of entertainment on a massive scale because beyond that, the film doesn't offer anything better."

Godzilla: King of the Monsters addresses the latter problem by upping the number of monsters and fights almost to an excessive extent. The former criticism, though, is not addressed well, as the human characters somehow got worse and feel downright comical at most points in their decision-making and dialogue. While the sometimes stunning action and cinematography truly make this movie look and feel awesome, the plot and development is laughable and paper thin, bringing the movie into Transformers-lite territory. King of the Monsters shows many moments of promise and beauty in its cinematography and kaiju designs and battles, its poor excuse for characters and a story keep this movie from being anything more than a pretty fun but also mindless summer popcorn blockbuster."

A nicely made sci-fi-thriller, but the entire storyline was built on a very familiar plot. You can find it similarities with 'Splice', 'Uncanny' and 'Ex Machina', but I think overall not a bad attempt. I did not get impressed, so do most of the people who saw those films, especially the end scene. Though it is entertaining, particularly when it turns into an action mode.

The corporate that invested in a research sends an investigator named Lee after the project was met with a small accident. During an interview, the chaos unleashes and the lab started to fall apart. The survivours does not know who to trust, but decides to save their subject. What really follows after that will be totally unexpected and another twist before the final credits.

Knowing it's a research, the mistake is emotionally attached to the subject. That's what all the similar topic films reveal. Then what's the point of doing such test, being doctor, studied psychology. For a film plot, they wanted to use the human sentiments and errors. Otherwise, science does not really deal like what was shown in this film.

From a new director, with the decent actors, particularly Kate Mara's best in an action avatar. I liked the Anya in the film 'The Witch' and this is another good performance by her in the title role. Felt like it is a short film, because the pace was so good, even though the story was a one-liner. Minimal cast film and takes place in a remote place secret research lab. A film not for everyone, but not bad for once viewing.

It was a short movie with an interesting plotline that had me invested. It was surrounded by great people and great performances. So why did it fail?
This movie contained a lot of structural issues that should be addressed. First, the characters were nearly dimension-less in a movie with a very interesting plotline or series of events. In Room (2015), the movie appeared to be split into two parts, but the character arcs were there and the characters themselves were very interesting, allowing the audience to find interest in both parts of the movie. This movie tried that approach without making the characters interesting, making the first half merely filler and the second half almost pointless. Even if Morgan was the best character in the movie, her character had no good motivation until the second part and she was an antagonist at best.
I would also like to comment on how in the second half of the movie, some of the plot points are rather absurd and there appears to be no reason for them. Overall: even with great performances and the plotline in the second half being at least interesting, the characters are shoddy and the whole movie fell apart pretty much because of that. Therefore, I can only grant Morgan a seal of expendability."
2227,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/morgan/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,AGeekNamedBob,"Sep 12, 2016",4,"MORGAN is latest take on the age-old concept of “scientists create life. Life doesn’t act they way the scientists desired. That is, life keeps trying to kill them.” One of last year’s best films (perhaps the best depending on when you ask me) EX_MACHINA used that base in an original, thought provoking and absolutely engrossing manner.  MORGAN is not EX_MACHINA, the first film as a director from writer Alex Garland. I bring this up for MORGAN is also a first feature film, this time for Luke Scott, son of famed director Ridley.  This is writer Seth W. Owen’s second produced feature.  So new to the job is not an excuse when EX_MACHINA is compared. For genre films from famous director's sons, you should also check out ANTIVIRAL from David Cronenberg's son Brandon.
​
Scott gathered a stable of great character actors to try to give life to Owen’s underwritten script.  Most notable is the continually underappreciated Rose Leslie, best known as Ygritte in GAME OF THRONES (“Yew knoew nuthin’ Jon Snew”) and the underseen HONEYMOON. The exception is Kate Mara, who continues to bland her ways through roles. I suspect people keep thinking they’re getting her more talented sister, just as I can only guess the actors in MORGAN thought they were getting Luke’s more talented father (or owed him a favor).  Stalwarts like Brian Cox, Toby Jones and Michelle Yeoh each have a few scenes to sell along with people you might not have seen in many things before – including Chris Sullivan, making his second painful encounter this year with a genetically enhanced strange little girl after his turn as the diner owner in STRANGER THINGS. Jennifer Jason Leigh is in this film, although I kept forgetting she was.  Paul Giamatti is the most known, presenting a house-hold face to the picture in one overly long sequence that is seemingly meant to move sympathy further to the titular character. As Morgan herself, Anya Taylor-Joy is admirable, continuing her hopefully rise to fame from this spring’s period horror masterpiece, THE WITCH.
​
That sympathy for Morgan is one of the issues of the piece. It’s not that we, the audience, feel for her. It’s that the film, from sequence to sequence, doesn’t seem to be sure if it wants us to.  The scientists are all likeable, so when thing to go pot as we all know they will, we feel bad for them; but if we also feel for Morgan there is a conflict there. Conflicting sympathies can work in a stronger film.  If there were more exploration into what Morgan is, how she actually feels and the implications of her creation – that sympathy can go both ways. But it all remains simply at surface level. Films of this sort, even the other bad ones like SPECIES and SPLICE still try to bring up something new into the set up, but MORGAN has nothing to say. It doesn’t even try.  It could be the focus is elsewhere but it doesn’t come through. Instead the lack of discussion into “what makes a person” is a gaping hole in the script.  “But, Bob, isn’t Kate Mara the protagonist in the ads?” you ask. Why sure, reader, she is.  But she’s cold and lifeless, distant and hard to indentify with.  But I wonder if we are meant to. It maybe spoilers but not really with how telegraphed it is, but there is a twist with her character that would indicate we’re not meant to follow her despite her being the surrogate into this situation.  This “twist” is so blatantly set up that I’m not worried about spoiling it.
​
Not just the character twist, but the entire film is telegraphed and empty. One can see every beat well before it happens, but the Scott has set it up in a way that it feels like he’s being clever and surprising.  Its only in the programming where Scott attempts to make the film visually interesting or move in anyway.  For fifteen minutes, the film becomes a slasher film, but creates no tension.  Then comes the lowest energy car chase I’ve ever seen in film.    Despite this lifelessness, it doesn’t drag – so that’s something. It just feels like it’s going through the motion.
​
MORGAN isn’t worth anyone’s time.  Any film it reminds you of is better: even the SPECIES films.  It brings nothing new to the subgenre.  Instead, watch EX_MACHINA. Seen EX_MACHINA? Watch it again. Or JURASSIC PARK. That’s a create life that goes wrong for everyone else movie that can’t be beat."

I saw the trailer for the movie and it's kinda like an awesome mashup between Ex-Machina meets Aliens, but in a time where Ridley just completely lost his rhythm thanks to a slew of his disappointments (Exodus: Gods & Kings and Robin Hood), Morgan still has enough elements to an underrated gem (because it's directed by first-time director Luke Scott, son of Ridley and late brother, Tony). I love the casting in this movie: Kate Mara, Paul Giamatti, Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Jason Leigh, etc. I thought the performances were great. And so does newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy, who delivered a stunning performance in the acclaimed indie horror classic, The Witch. But my biggest problem is Morgan (the character and her ability to control her inner Carrie with some weird supernatural powers). Luke thought it would be a great idea, it's just that the execution for her character development in Morgan just wasn't quite there. Morgan's backstory feels dumbfounded and the filmmakers just rushed the timing of the character too quickly so that if it does sounded like the next great horror movie I've been waiting for but executed in a different pasture. I was also disappointed at the marketing of this movie seeing that Fox (which is not having a great 2016 so far) wanted to invest what should've been a big opportunity to hope for a comeback after a slew of misfires this summer. But still it wasn't. Seriously, this is a perfect thriller I should definitely watch too. I'm sure hope it should be a future cult movie soon that could now join ""Cube,"" ""Gattaca,"" and ""Event Horizon"" as underdogs of underrated sci-fi movies none of us ever saw in theaters.

It does not give you the jeepers-creepers you saw in the trailers, and the A.I Morgan itself was a much poorly excecuted character than the rest of the cast. Luke Scott helms the throne of direction and does a decent job, Kate Mara is excellent as an accountant who is chased and psychologically manipulated by Morgan. It does deserve a re-watch to completely understand some components of the film, and is one I can get back to. Morgan is perfect for sci-fi junkies, but normal moviegoers will get confused if this is a horror film or an action movie.

Sadly, what Morgan does is what Morgan fails to deliver. Believe me, if it was actually horror, it would've scored a 2, but it's actually not. It's far more than that and it's still not horror regardless what you say. Now onward to the problem; Morgan supposedly doesn't have a purpose for its plot. Sad news, but it's true. It does seem that they rushed the plot or something like that. Don't definitely let out your tickets to see Morgan. Keep it personal and don't expect much whenever it comes to seeing Morgan and do not say it's a horror because it's far more than that."

Charlie Mills (Nick Robinson) is a young drug addict, who is going into rehab for the first time. Like most young people, he thinks it's a joke, until he meets the other people are hears their stories. Ultimately Charlie decides to be strong for his new friends and love interest, but being Charlie isn't so easy when temptation is everywhere. You can see from the beginning of the film that this is supposed to be some kind of a wake up call to addicts, but as someone whose had very close people in his life who suffer from the disease, I can tell you that much of this film was inaccurate. Rehab is portrayed as this wonderful place, that looks like a hotel, and has people with hearts of gold. They all have their own sad stories, but they are all good people now, just looking to get better. This is far from the way it is. As the story progressed, it basically went from a story of addiction into a love story, with addiction being an after thought, until the very end. Nick Robinson stars and he's the reason I made it through the whole film. This kid is absolutely terrific, especially in these types of roles. Kings of Summer was his breakout performance and a tremendous film. Being Charlie was an equally great performance, however it was a film that's lacking direction and almost misses the point. I liked what they were going for in the film and the cast was top notch, but the problem was that it wasn't realistic enough and couldn't decide weather or not it wanted to be a film about recovery, a love story, or simply a deep look into Charlie's life. The bottom line, it was a great performance wasted in a slow moving, unrealistic story."

There are some films from this director I liked, I consider them my favourites, but this is an average film. I always like his film story lines and characters, something better than what other filmmakers fails to do. This is another interesting theme and this time it was about the drug addiction. The story **** named Charlie, who just turned 18 and being released from a rehab camp for underage people. But his father who runs for the governor wants him to go for adult's rehab right away. He does not want to, but after no other option, he joins and meets a troubled girl Eva. A little romance blooms and followed by how it all ends bring a full stop to the narration.

Looks a good theme, but the purpose was confusing. Of course, the drugs related issues, especially the film focused on the road of recovery from such addition. But it stayed more real than cinematic twists and turns. One way you will know how it all ends, but some of the characters were unpredictable. The end was good, concludes with a little message. Nick Robinson was really great. Initially I thought it was Jack O'Connell's film, mistook Nick Roinson as him from the poster. Lacks depth in narration, but really a nice film. At least you should watch it for Rob Reiner, if you're not convinced enough.

Unrelentingly downbeat all the way, this cynical ultra vicious movie continually goes for the worst in humanity - from a manic rogue cop (easily the worst possible example) to the drug destroyed wife of an ex-cop, to a little girl being held from her family for untold purposes, and rampaging cop killers, shooting up any that come their way, etc, etc, (all in a nights work) While it may give us a look into the dregs of society – it wallows in its negativity, failing to offer its audience any glimmer of hope (no wonder they stayed away)

Performances are all good and the contrast between the young rookie and grizzled vet works most of the time but with an unrelenting barrage of hopelessness - wrapped up in a script by writer/director (Joel Souza) who, unfortunately, seems incapable of stringing sentences together without every other word being a vulgarity. While so-called ‘trendy’ Hollywood types might speak like this it also assures it becomes tiresome for many others.

At least it has a pounding, moody soundtrack. In the seventies, films like ‘The New Centurions’ served this theme with some reasonable justice, and even though times have certainly changed, can it truly be as blatantly radical as we are being bludgeoned with here."

This is a slow fantasy-drama about two teen siblings who are living in an isolated location and their inherited ability to cheat space within their sight. What goes wrong when they just want to play with it, but it's forbidden by their strict father is the rest of the story.

It is a weakest writing for a movie that borrowed an idea from the others. Failed to capitalise and falls into an average list. There is no particular performance to point out, but Kiernan Shipka is who had more screenspace and was decent with her show.

There's nothing much to talk about the movie, the dialogues were very rare and too short. A simple drama, mostly boring for its uninteresting under developed scenes.

His single mother Maggie, played by Naomi Watts, and Ray, live with her mother, Dodo, played by Susan Sarandon, and her longtime lover Frances, played by Linda Emond.

At the beginning of the movie we see Maggie trying to deal with Ray’s decision, struggling with what verbs to use, worried that after Ray goes through the change he may think he made a mistake plus having to put up with Dodo, an old time feminist, who believes Ray should stay Ramona and just be a lesbian. If the film had stuck with Ray’s story and the reaction of the two older generation it would have been an excellent film but instead it veers off to Maggie’s past and the complications that involves

Ray’s father Craig, played by Tate Donovan, who hasn’t had anything to do with Ramona for more than a decade, now discovers his daughter needs his signature on the consent form to become his son. We also meet his brother Matthew, played by Sam Trammell, who was involved with them.  Throw in that Craig now haves another family with 3 kids and all of a sudden we turn from an involved story of a transgender person into a soap opera.

Maggie’s story is interesting but she deserves her own movie. This movie is only an hour and 27 minutes but it feels as if 3 hours was being packed into it.

Elle Fanning gives a very strong, believable performance as a transgender teenager who knows who he is and is willing to stand up for his decisions while Naomi Watts as his mother shows the perplexing problems a parent can go through while this is all taking place with an equally strong performance. As always Sarandon gives a dynamic performance while Linda Emond is very droll as the put upon lover. They are both wasted in the film as are Donovan and Trammell’s story lines .

Television is way ahead of film regarding the issues and understandings of transgender while movies, aside from “Boys Don’t Cry” and “The Crying Game”, need to get serious on the subject.

“3 Generations” is a good start on transgender issues but it gets bogged down in what use to be called a ‘women’s film’. It is worth seeing for Fanning’s performance and for people who have no idea what transgender people are about and go through."

That way, the franchise remains juvenile, yet accessible to its now adult, original gamers. This smart decision by Paramount drew worldwide attention to this release, despite its former, flailing brand name (the Sonic franchise had a decade long series of delays and poor sequels). Since this movie’s target audience is the early childhood demographic, voice overs are silly and overtly pronounced, physical behavior is slowed and salient and the story is warm and elementary. The writing is wordy and directed at parents. The interrace couple and loser male characters play into the politics of modern Hollywood. Jim Carrey is an ideal casting for this film, given his antics and extravagance. Sadly, this generation of Hollywood fired all its English majors in lieu of radical activists, and the poorly managed plot and dialogue prove it. Confounded by its alien protagonist, the half-wits in the writer’s room are hard pressed to make good use of screen time: Sonic spins its wheels thru tedious backstory and dreary sidelining. The script is excessive and comic moments fail to be funny.Despite these issues, some Hollywood ventures are simply too big to fail. Movies like 2011’s The Smurfs and 2015’s The Force Awakens have too large a fanbase to ever misfire. Due to its worldwide recognition and stellar product placement, Sonic the Hedgehog was a worldwide success (earning back three times its budget)! Whether you love the franchise, have kids or simply want a goofy distraction, Sonic the Hedgehog reminds us of the joy and excitement (and tiresome trouble) that the mischievous and benevolent little ones in our lives bring us. Who knows? One might be secretly watching you right now…."

While admittedly not the movie's focus, James Marsden and Tikka Sumpter have what feels like less than zero chemistry. The nadir of this movie is a fart joke about two thirds of the way through the movie that is painfully unfunny, with Sonic's flossing after one of the action scenes being a close second.

It was... alright, but story-wise it ain't nothin' special (pretty common for Sonic). Jim Carrey makes a pretty good Eggman (though he only looks the part at the end). The one thing that would've made me drop the score to a zero is Sonic doing the flossing thing from Fortnite. Not even the fart joke, the **** Fortnite dancing. As if the movie needed some reasons for me to hate it. When you resort to Fortnite ""jokes"" for laughs, you know you ain't **** when it comes to humor.

Also, Sonic isn't Flash nor Quicksilver (although comparable). He doesn't generate energy as he runs and he can't run so fast that time seems to stop so he can **** around with everyone or everything in the vicinity. Actually, there's a few times where he ain't even runnin' and time stops.

Anyway, the movie isn't meant to be taken seriously; it's just another Sonic continuity separate from all the other ones. I don't think they should make another one though."

You know what stuck with me the most was how Sonic says he has watched the 1994 action movie 'Speed' loads of times, so does that mean he witnessed Dennis Hopper getting decapitated on endless repeat? Or how about Beth Grant being run over by a bus? Makes you think sometimes.

**** a great movie, but man this could have been so much worst. I am glad the studios listened to fans and changed that revolting character design on Sonic. It is just too bad that the animates were laid off after the studio was closed. Yikes.

Jim Carry, even at the age of 58, has not lost that chaotic energy. Robotnik's dance scene was easily the highlight. What is more impressive is Carry improvised the dance scene and recommended the song ""Where Evil Grows"". James Marsden sure does love cgi animals. I guess this completes the trilogy. 'Enchanted', 'Hop', and now 'Sonic'. Still likable and talented though. So yeah, it's an average family adventure comedy that never failed to entertain. This is coming from a guy who is not a diehard fan of the character or game series, but still found some enjoyment out of it."

The rest of this film can be marked up to poorly veiled marketing (seriously, stop talking about the Olive Garden) and nonsense driven plot points. Without spoiling anything, in the trailer it reveals Sonic being able to be so fast that he can take the time to yawn and tap his foot when dozens of missiles are aimed directly at him yet he is able to be shot by a tranquilizer dart.

Cant say it surprised us in any particular way, just the standard 'alien meets human' family movie shenanigans. Some decent 'slowmo' actioney moments, and mildly enjoyable Carreyisms... Somehow there was that extra something missing, perhaps I was just feeling the general weight of such a rigid 'standard plotline' rather than a more fluid and random 'what the hell can we do with this random alien speedster' stuff I hoped for more of.

That said, there are moments that made me crack a smile and even laugh out loud a handful of times. 90% of these good moments come from Jim Carrey. You can tell Carrey's having a lot of fun in this role. He definitely knows what this movie is and he fully embraces the eccentric mad scientist role of Robotnik, coming through with 0 cringe-inducing jokes, lines, or scenes. I cannot say the same for Sonic or James Marsden's cop character. If you plan on seeing this, you will need to fully turn off your brain to enjoy it. Characters regularly make decisions and statements that don't make any sense and Sonic% speed is underutilized at several points purely in service of the plot. In its defense, the movie absolutely does not ask to be taken seriously. Unfortunately that still doesn't stop huge logical inconsistencies from breaking the illusion and immersion of it all.

2291,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/mi-5/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,FilipeNeto,"Jun 30, 2019",4,"Typical movie for TV

This film is basically the hunt that the MI-5 (British intelligence service specializing in internal security) promotes a fearsome terrorist who escapes them between the fingers. Suspicions that there is a traitor within MI-5 lead two operatives to act in default of the rules and orders to capture and save the service.

Of all, the MI-5 is a modest cousin of the British intelligence services, in that it is less well-known and mediatic than the neighbor MI-6. However, the film, which reminded me in some of a common movie 007 (for example, the insertion of credits and some action and fight scenes), is nice to see, although not very good. Only now, when documenting myself to make this criticism, did I realize that this film is the result of a British television series and that many of the characters we have seen here were born in it. However, when I saw the film, I realized clearly that it was a movie more thought for the TV than for the big screen.

The script is simplistic and direct, cinematography is vulgar, the soundtrack is uninteresting and there are many dead moments and a reasonable dose of predictability. I do not know any of the actors but I think they were up to the task, which is not surprising if they had done those characters before.

Not being close, brilliant, this movie is not that bad and entertains our time well. However, I did not feel like going to see the series that gave rise to it."

2297,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/in-the-heart-of-the-sea/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Spangle,"Feb 12, 2017",6,"Ron Howard is a good director. What separates him from being great is that he is entirely dependent on his script. He is a good director because when given any material, he plays to its strengths and lets the narrative and characters do the talking. He is not flashy and lets the film breathe, rather he is a confident, knowledgeable, and smart filmmaker able to make the most of any material he is given. Unfortunately, this also means that bad material he is given will be watchable, but still bad (The Da Vinci Code). Great material lives up to its potential and Howard's assured hand gives the film the extra push to become a top-notch film (Apollo 13). In the Heart of the Sea is in the middle of these two. A solid film that would have been awful under a lesser director, but could have been special with a great director, the film is a middle-of-the-road film with pros and cons.

In the pros column, we have the visuals. Painstakingly gorgeous, it is a shame that this film bombed because it deserved recognition for the cinematography. On land, it beautifully captures the whaling towns and the New England feeling of these small sea towns. In town, the browns and grays are gorgeous. Gratuitous shots of the ocean from  Owen Chase's (Chris Hemsworth) home with the green town on the side. With Anthony Dod Mantle's camera gently floating up and catching this beauty of the small seaside town in 1820s Nantucket, it feels practically idyllic. On the open ocean, the sunset lends beautiful oranges and yellows to adorn the film that leads to lush greens and blues. With long shot after long shot of the sun's orange casting down on the green and blue of the open ocean, In the Heart of the Sea is a painfully beautiful film. The cinematography gives this film impeccable visuals that feel like a painting one could find of ships in the 1800s. A true visual accomplishment, In the Heart of the Sea is a film that demands to be seen in order for every living person to be awed by the sheer beauty of the proceedings.

Unfortunately, this perfect cinematography is not matched by the visual effects. Compared to another film based around oil and disasters, Deepwater Horizon, the visual effects in this film are pretty bad at times. The whale looks incredible and, again, shots on the open ocean look great. The fire looks terrific too. Unfortunately, shots during the storm and while whaling are really ruined by how fake it all looks. It is similar to car being driven in a film from the 1940s or 1950s. It looks like it was filmed on a set, which is a shame. Similarly, a few action set pieces also look entirely staged, similar to the effects in a 1970s disaster movie. These moments do no just disrupt the suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience, but just look awful compared to the gritty realism of the rest of the film.

Another major negative for this film is the acting. In the lead role, Chris Hemsworth plays Thor. Pretending to have a New England accent in one scene where he says apaht instead of apart, he is fine and entirely palatable. But, either have an accent throughout the whole thing or just forget about trying. Sean Connery made a whole career on his looks, being cool, and playing every character as a Scotsman. Hemsworth can do the same, but he has to stop pretending. Alongside him, Benjamin Walker is pretty bad Captain Pollard, but nobody is as egregiously bad as Tom Holland. Every line he speaks honestly hurts. From the very beginning, Holland never utters a line with any conviction. He knows he is acting and we know he is acting. Shame the production team made the actors suffer so much (500-600 calories a day) to capture authenticity for such bad performances. Cannot say it was worth it on their parts. The only actors trying are Ben Whishaw and Brendan Gleeson, but as Herman Melville and old Thomas Nickerson, all they do is talk about the story and are not given much to do throughout. Of those who suffer, Cillian Murphy is alright, but even he turns in a lackluster performance compared to his body of work.

With bad visual effects and bad acting, In the Heart of the Sea is a film that simply lacks the depth needed to be a good film. Its story and characters are fine, but never as rich as the cinematography and painting-esque shots adorning the film. That said, as with all Ron Howard films, it is entirely watchable, riveting, and a film that entertains throughout despite its seemingly crusty and aged story."

However one that's enjoyable elements are strictly tied/limited to the whale(s). The other stuff which includes tension between the captain and first mate, Herman Melville interviewing the last survivor of the disaster, and some character moments all fall short. They aren't enough to sink the ship, but they do make for less than smooth sailing.

It's hard to get into at first. I didn't care about the characters so when much of the film's opening consists of introducing us to these characters it's hard for the mind to not wander. Then the first whale shows up and things turn around. The characters themselves still aren't interesting, but their adventure begins to find some life. We get a fascinating look at whaling and some visually stunning creatures. The ocean and the whales that call it home are gorgeous here. It's that visual splendor and hardships the crew suffers because of them that carries the film back to port, even if worse for wear.

We have seen these survival elements before, so there is a sense of familiarity to it all. However that doesn't make the depiction of being stranded at see any less harrowing, especially with a gorgeous, massive whale making things harder for them at every turn.

It's a beautiful and occasionally boring survival story. One that never quite gets any morals out there. However the whales bring a dose of life to the film to keep in from being dragged to the depths of Davy Jones' Locker. The fact that it's a true story also helps. For land lovers this isn't going to be the cruise ship you're looking for, but for those with a love for the sea it's worth setting out to sea. Even if it's little better than a rowboat at times.

How it is actually the movie as complete ? Many ways to define this project can be used although it become countless ways. Could be defined as the last work of the enigmatic director, An adaptation of the novel that inspired the classic ""****"". Could be defined as the mix between non-fiction and drama, thing that can´t be combined quite right because it loses the center point of the movie which it's fully the drama of a best-seller tragedy. Could be defined as instructive, development was incredibly slow and It seems to teach us that a whale is not just a small animal, it´s the God of the seas and for this reason the human beings should not be interested in whale oil or in any of its strong attractants, managing to create a teaching in the global fisheries mind.Could be defined as a story about the survival **** of brave men (to the style of ""The 33"" they had families and wanted to either go home) led by a macho and wealthy captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) it as cliche would not have affinity with the role of Hemsworth (Owen Chase). Finally, Could be described as an opportunity to show the corporate ethics, where the survivors are forced to lie about what happened, fearing that the company does not cover agreed costs.
It is not exaggeration, this, manages to capture each of the previous designated items but at the same time fails nothing, What does this mean? The project director was so ambitious that to mix so many elements for achieve an award fell into the void spilling any possibility of a prestigious Academy Award. OK, ""In The Heart Of The Sea"" would be a quaintly dark paint with  thinking philosophically of Directors as 'Steven Spielberg' or 'Werner Herzog' but Howard had a completely different view, for this reason it is that so far his best film is 'Apolo 13'.

The point of break of all the film is this, wanting to be everything at the same time the film is converted into short-movies separated in sub-genres of a central theme ""A marine attack on a whaling ship"" but the central point of its break is its narrative, having Melville goes to the house to interview, ask and write down what happened that day (Brendan Gleeson in the present-day scenes, Tom Holland as his younger self)  for the creation of his successful book that tends to reduce his own writing to transcribe the happened on 1820s, often interrupted for memorable action scenes, for example of this the beautiful work of directing, cinematography and editing at the time of the splendid onslaught of the mammal. Sometimes this could be screenwriter Charles Leavitt's attempt to create a cinematic equivalent to Melville's tendency to interrupt his narratives with  with passages and literary events that surprised us to read.

As soon as it completes the scene, feels a vacuum feel to see the result of a succession of mistakes and successes to the terrible sub-narrative.  Without a doubt it's anachronistic and incoherent, the moment where the whalers if they did well to kill the whale (seriously not, It's 1820 not 2015, Mistake #1) or the bits where the afflicted whalers explain to the young Melville that the whaling industry was so successful and triumphant as today the oil industry (seriously not, Perhaps they sent you a message on Facebook or WhatsApp or you get an e-mail where you explained that a man decided to open a hole in the ground and extract a liquid called ""oil"", It's 1820 not 2015).

Okay, it is impossible that contemporary writers unearth their minds of the demons of present and do we immerse in the years 1820 without details of the topicaly, since it is very difficult that the facts of the past surprised for own merit. This is not to say that the old is not lucrative and amazing knowing that some of the best historical movies and TV series shine for its details and pragmatisms of the represented time.

Touches that seem to be ironically forced into cinematography - such as the character of Hemsworth, Owen Chase, Owen tries to spear the vengeful whale for the second time but freezes after staring into one of its large and curious pair of eyes, seems foolish here. Are we to believe that a man who has lasted his entire life hunting whales (for a promotion to captain) goes to cow having in his hands his life and the crew??? All is a collusion fully planned, something that water, a good body and a whale may not **** another director took the mandate of the boat and the whole film would have been different.

Unquestionably, ""In The Heart of the ****"" should be the title of this film, having been an interesting thriller, a disjointed film, an almost exact copy of the book of auto-help and one look wrong. How would have been this movie with another narrative? Perhaps had come out of the port? Amenably attractive exciting and inscrutable, ""In The Heart of The Sea"" never manages to collect its greater role."

With such a ready made story, it's shocking the film does not succeed.  Because the movie spends so much time focusing on the recurring narrative technique which has Herman Melville meeting with the last living survivor of the Essex (the usually incomparable Gleeson), it loses the opportunity to character develop the two main characters on the ship.  Thus, when the encounter with the whale and its aftermath ensues, the viewer has little emotionally invested in any of the survivors.  Apart from spectacular visuals with the whale, the movie has little going for it in any area.  Recommend the viewer invest in the book for a well told, exciting and amazing true life adventure story."

He does have some weaker movies and sadly In the Heart of the Sea is one of them. The film relies more on visuals than on a interesting story and characters. Ron Howard collaborates with Chris Hemsworth again after he was great in Rush in 2013. I'd be completely fine if Hemsworth replaces Tom Hanks as Howards new frequent collaborator. He was definitely one of the upsides of the movie. I have no doubt in my mind that this man is a true movie star. Cillian Murphy is also in this film and he is painfully underused considering how talented he is.

The major issue with In the Heart of the Sea is that it just does not have the characters that you can latch onto and care about. Then when the **** hits the fan later on in the film you really don't care if they live or die. I would find this film very comparable to Angelina Jolie's Unbroken from last year. Its also about 10 or 20 minutes too long."

While this isn't that but a tale of the true story that inspired the writing of that epic literary classic, it's probably as close as we'll get for a while now.  With Ron Howard being behind this especially classically styled epic you'd expect it solid in craftsmanship all the way round and it is.
The image is intentionally old style and looks as if it could have been shot 60 years ago, yet was made with the latest digital cameras using all the most advanced techniques going with state-of-the-art CGI of course, which looks good.  The whales are realistic if not all the sun flares and water droplets.  I did particularly like the unorthodox use of yellow/greens in the picture which look lousy in TV spots for the movie, but just fine on the big screen.  (I started noticing about 10 years ago that CGI in movies often does not hold up on any kind of small screen even in Full HD, while the same shots look stunning in a theatre.  This is a whole issue I need to get into sometime…)  I've also often stated that if ""Jaws"" were made today it would not be nearly the classic it was because CGI would certainly ruin it.  I stand by that, but here it's great.  It's a much different kind of story and with whales not one shark.
Unfortunately the film drags.  It just didn't involve me despite my desire for its story and subject matter.  The music score for example is stale and uninspiring as is much of the latter part of the story if anything because we've seen it before too many times and there is nothing unique here driving it.  I wish they made more out of the ecological aspect that's nicely touched upon and directly connects today's world.
Overall a noble effort probably lost on today's audience."

In the Heart of the Sea takes place in 1820, a whaling ship out of New England, the Essex, encountered a sperm whale that seemed to have a streak of human vengeance, assailing the ship and stranding the crew out in the ocean for 90 days. The true story was the inspiration for Herman Melville's classic novel, Moby ****.

So I've just seen In the Heart of the Sea and it very disappointing. It was one of my most anticipated movie of December right next to Star wars, The Revenant and The Hateful Eight, but sadly it didn't live up to my expectations as much as I wanted it to. The trailer for the movie completely lied to us just like most trailers today, I mean the whale itself shows ups a couple of times in the movie and we stuck with characters that we don't care about.

Ron Howard can be a mix bag sometimes when it comes to his movies. Some are good, some are in the middle and some bad. But I still think he's a great director that can really bring a well crafted and brilliantly directed movie. While I thought Rush (the 2013 film with Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl) was a solid movie, but it's not the type of movie I'll be re watching any time soon, but still I think it's a well directed movie and it showed that Ron Howard still got it when it comes to film making. And here he's still got that unique film making quality in him and I think he did a good job of making the audiences feel really small, and it's not just because of the whale that makes you feel small but the sea itself. But I feel like he really lost himself mid way through the movie as he really lost it's touch. The directing was good, just not brilliant as I wanted it to be.

Chris Hemsworth was really good in this movie and this is the role that he really went for it. If you haven't heard about the shocking weight loss that he did just for the movie and now that's what I call dedication right there. The same thing can be said about the rest of the cast as there wasn't a weak performance. Hemsworth's accent dose go off and on quite often, but overall all the performances from everyone were good.

The movie is basically a man vs nature type of movie which is favorite part of the movie by far.

Now for the problems: I did not give a crap about any of these characters and that's a big problem. The characters are so bland, so dull and quite unlikable. Nothing is development with the characters and the only time that I actually cared for them is around the third act. The writers try to make us care for Hemsworth character just by adding in the most cliche thing that any screenwriter can writer to his character and that's having are main hero have a pregnant wife who's at home, so he fights for survival to get back to her, but do the writers know that makes the character more basic, unoriginal and cliche. That's not going to make me automatically like the guy.

The visual effect's was another thing that was so disappointing to me, because the effect's were very noticeable at times and it's mostly the CG background. The effect's on the whale looked great but the effects for everything else was pretty bad and quite disappointing, since effect's should be better right now, but then again, I said the same thing about Transformers 4 and Fant4stic.

Overall In the Heart of the Sea was very disappointing and it could have easily been great. The characters are dull, the effect's are noticeable, it's slow at times and the cinematography doesn't quite have that epic scope that the movie wants."

I'm happy to say that this movie was surprisingly good! Sure, the pacing was slow and at a few parts it got dull. But away from that I though it was a fun watch. The movie's build up was long, It took almost the entire movie to get to the actual meat of the film. The acting wasn't phenomenal but was most definitely watchable especially the ones from Chris Hemsworth and Tom Holland. For the time they are on screen together, they have a very watchable chemistry. The whole Mentor and Mentee thing going on between them is quite enjoyable. The cinematography and visual effects were absolutely breathtaking. Every time you see Moby **** destroying the ships and wrecking havoc is just tension filled and heart pumping. The darker twist in the movie was supposed to cause “oh's” and “ah's” but I didn't see it. It felt forced into cause drama but just like Legend. You can't take it out of that true story because it is a true story and people would feel cheated. In the end, This movie was surprising.

For example, the car that runs off the road in a collision with wildlife, rolls over several times, crashes down an embankment, and ends up on the side of the road in the final shot. Or: the office worker who has a heart attack in his office while sitting on a water canister and remains lying there on the floor, and the final shot in which two legs stick out from a row of computer workstations, making it clear that this can't be the spot where the employee fell.

Seems the films of this director won't survive without Johnny Depp in the lead. Just one good film would change that conception. Is this the one! No, but was very close. After seeing the film I thought it could be based on the novel, but isn't. The writers must be good to create such atmosphere, outside the novel. I was very impressed with the film, though the screenplay lagged the pace. And a few things need to be explained where the narration failed to do so, keeping in mind the average intelligent people. Other than that it is a decent mystery-drama associated with fantasy and sci-fi. Due to a financial crisis in the firm, a young New Yorker goes to the Swiss Alps looking for his boss. At first he struggles to make a contact with him as the staffers are not friendly. After an unexpected incident, he has to stay a bit longer. In those periods, he comes to realise there's something wrong with the place, hence decides to uncover. Does he really do it! His struggles in the attempt and everything else were told in the remaining part.

Somewhat it reminded me 'Perfume: The Story of a Murderer'. Not until you finish watching it or figure it out the puzzle. Then the BG score was too cliché for such concept, but nothing can be replaced it. The film had a good opening. Even the mid part. But dragged in the latter section. The overall length of the film was another drawback for the narration.

There were no empty scenes, everything's were filled with something, but the end twist was not as phenomenal as promised in the earlier developments. Especially if you had seen a handful of similar masterpieces. It was kind of an old concept, like the pre 80s or something. Yet acceptable at present for being rare. Thus, it depends how well it was made. An above average film, but for those who haven't seen many films in their lives, this will be a great one.

The end was a bit ridiculous. The movie got really confusing towards the end with opposing plotlines. 6/10."

The cinematography is stunning, and there are moments of exquisite tension and horrifying monstrosity, though some went far into gratuitous territory. The storyline begins with intrigue, but unfolds without the intricacies I was expecting, resulting in an ultimately unsatisfying experience. The performances are accomplished, and the set design is superb, but don't expect the intellectual thrill the trailer would have you believe. 6.98/10"
2331,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-cure-for-wellness/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,KaptenVideo,"Mar 21, 2017",6,"One of those more ambitious horror movies. Young executive (Dane DeHaan) is sent to retrieve his company's CEO from an idyllic wellness center at a remote location in the Swiss Alps, but soon suspects that something fishy is going on.

„A Cure for Wellness“ is a curious beast. There’s a lot to like about the movie and it wants to try something fresh. But ultimately it’s too long and asks more from the viewer than is ready to give back, so approach with caution. Firstly, you will probably like how everything looks. Gore Verbinski’s directorial skill of making movie look good are widely known („Pirates of the Caribbean“ 1-3, „Rango“, „The Lone Ranger“) but this time he also wants to go artsy.

The movie is so stylish and carefully composed that many individual frames look like a painting, or some work of art. Verbinski knows how to make everything on screen matter, so often some little thing becomes interesting just because how it is captured or approached. This approach also helps to add some light humor – Verbinski is no Wes Anderson, of course, but it’s effective. All in all, the makers have put a lot of effort in world building and it really becomes an interesting place of its own. Just discovering different places alongside the main character becomes a constant source of amusement.

The story is also intriguing. For a long while I just followed it without really being able to predict what’s gonna happen – always a good thing for mainstream movie. Especially for one which develops its own style but also offers lots of nods to other (horror) stories, movies or directors. Maybe it's just me but I perceived echoes of Dracula, Frankenstein, Cthulhu, King, Poe; from the movies Martin Scorsese’s „Shutter Island“, Wes Anderson, Tim Burton, ""Saw"". But it’s not just mindless copying but tasteful and entertaining in its own right.

The problem is… for all the wealth of material and lovingly created world, the story and characters are disappointingly shallow.

At 144 minutes it is just too long, the story gets stretched too thin, especially the final act. It even dares to turn silly, which differs from the previous tone and sadly manages to lose the interest of many.

I still like Verbinski’s early-2000’s works „The Mexican“ and „The Weather Man“ better but I was much more emotionally invested watching „A Cure for Wellness“ than the „Pirates of the Caribbean“ trilogy, „Rango“ or „The Lone Ranger“.

So, I liked most of it, and endured the rest of it. If you like horror and fantasy, you should do the same. Probably. Who am I to say?"

No it’s just a mediocre film that really thinks it’s smarter than it is. As the story unfolds you’re left with nothing shocking or surprising and not only that but you’ll have it figured out soon enough. What is does have is enough disturbingly grotesque scenes to make you squirm in your seat and I can safely say I cannot look at eels or dentists the same again. You’ll spend a good portion of the film internally yelling at Dane DeHaan, no don’t do that, don’t drink that, no stop okay never mind. Jason Isaacs is definitely the stand out performance, although a little over the top in one particular instance he’s still the best thing in this. I was really with this film up until a certain point. Overall it’s an unfocused movie that is simply too long, gradually getting more and more ridiculous. Descending into a horribly messy ending that you eventually become disinterested in. Recommended if you’ve seen all the Oscar movies and looking for something a little off beat."

Inexplicably, he seems to have access to the property's most secretive recesses. There's lots of creepy settings and ominous music, but no suspense.

2336,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-cure-for-wellness/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GerardistheWay,"Feb 17, 2017",6,"Gore Verbinski's new psychological thriller is a puzzling movie. On the one hand, there's nothing bad enough in it to prevent me from recommending it, but on the other I still feel that I cannot whole-heartedly. It has promise, but when your film starts to feel like a bunch of cool shots and beautiful scenery strung together by a tenuous plot line, you risk audiences beginning to seek out A Cure for Boredom.

From the very first moments, when the film opens with shots of downtown New York buildings bathed in the kind of grimy green light that the worlds of these horror movies are always smothered in (*cough cough* ""Saw""... *cough cough*) accompanied by an eerie female vocalization (which returns several times in the story with no explanation of its significance), this movie is trying to show you just how creepy it (thinks) it is. And don't get me wrong, it has its moments (I guarantee that you'll never look at an eel the same way again after seeing this), but these have a tendency to come few and far between while the story runs around and around in circles. By the time that Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) begins to see the dark truth behind this seemingly miraculous ""wellness center"", the original plot line of him being sent to retrieve the CEO of his financial company (Harry Groener) and bring him back home has been more or less forgotten. This movie's got things on its mind, you can be sure, but it can't seem to decide what it wants to focus on, and so its visual style and interesting premise become lost in a muddy, mired plot that features the unfortunate combination of being overlong in trying to be epic as well as repetitive and preachy in trying to be thoughtful and intelligent. I would be lying if I said I wasn't somewhat expecting this from a re-teaming of Verbinski and ""The Lone Ranger"" screenwriter Justin Haythe.

Perhaps the greatest strengths this film possesses are its visuals, direction, and performances. DeHaan, with his turn as Lockhart, crafts a hero not completely likable (his obsession with survival of the fittest and his obvious dislike of visiting his mother don't exactly make him endearing, which helps us somewhat enjoying, or at least thinking he deserves, the suffering brought upon him) but that navigates the frightening absurdity of his situation with much of the same rage, fear, and disbelief that most of us would. Jason Isaacs, as the German-sounding director of the treatment center, is likely to remind you of a **** officer in both his physical appearance and his mannerisms. On the surface he is friendly, seemingly helpful, charming, and by all appearances is intensely concerned not only for his patients but for Lockhart as well. However, he is truthfully a manipulative individual, one who loves playing mind games and constantly seems a step ahead of Lockhart (until the finale because, you know, it'd be no fun if the villain ended up winning for once). Think Annie Wilkes crossed with Ralph Fiennes' Amon Göth character from ""Schindler's List"" and you'd have the idea. Mr. Isaacs is easily the best thing about this movie: he plays his character with such skill that even after we're fairly certain he's evil we begin doubting ourselves yet again. Mia Goth, a relative newcomer, is also skilled as Hannah, a mysterious patient at the facility who is closer to Lockhart's age than most (the others are all octogenarians), and whose relationship with Isaacs' Dr. Vomler character forms the true conflict of the movie. There is something endearing about her performance: she is strange, to be sure, but there is a certain seductiveness about her that she exudes without even really trying to (you all may remember the bathtub scene from the trailers), all while dressed in clothes so old they look like they could have been around about 400 years ago. By the way, did I mention the tragedy that occurred there around that time involving a baron trying to keep his bloodline pure by using the same practice the Ancient Egyptians did?

The cinematography is likewise just as skilled. Bojan Bazelli does his best to distract us from how limp and sickly the ""story"" (BWAH HA HA! ...Was that out loud?) of this film really is with beautiful shots of the Swiss Alps, of the facility and with gloomier shots of corporate buildings and the modern world as we know it. The scenes featuring nature and fauna are the ones where sunlight pours in and the light is soft and gentle and puts us at ease. The insides of the facility look like they haven't seen a bit of change since the 1950s and looks a bit like a period piece with some steampunk sensibility. All of this is well and good, but without a decent story to back it up all of the style present is simply for naught.

Gore Verbinski is not a bad director. He just, for some reason, continues to work with bad screenwriters. Perhaps another collaboration between him and John Logan is due. The first one, ""Rango"", won a Best Animated Feature Oscar, if you recall. 6/10"

When something comes up that will be important later, you can tell because it is so overt.

The second Jack Reacher film is a slick affair with quality production, scenes, and acting. It’s hard to fault specifically but its largely by-the-numbers feel leaves little impression beyond the moment. Adding emotional constipation to an action hero is hardly a huge step but Cruise handles it well while Cobie Smulders basically reprises her SHIELD role and does a good job. Youngster Danika Yarosh also entertains but the pieces somehow just don’t come together.

The villains in the film are non-existent as they are rarely used despite having some pretty solid actors attached to the roles.

The action is very basic as well and no where near as good as the first film. I also agree with another reviewer where we never see Reacher's thought process and how he comes to the conclusions that he does. He just does it and the movie goers are suppose to accept it. I'd rather they take out that weak sub plot and add a bit more investigating and back story to things to make the plot as a whole more interesting.

Overall, Jack Reacher 2 really doesn't make you want to come back for a third. They stuck too much to the formula and don't offer much in terms of originality."

Like I said, since I haven't read any of the novels I can't really complain about that. But anyway I digress. I actually rather enjoyed Cruise in the first film with his fun mix of action and humorous moments and that's exactly what I got once again with this one! I will admit that this one did feel a bit dumbed down in terms of story and didn't feel quite as inspired as the first film did, but it was still a mindless fun and a worthwhile and entertaining sequel for the most part.

As far as Cruise, like always he's good and will almost pull you through the seen it all before proceedings here.  And unlike the abominably bad ""Jason Bourne"" for example (which does not get nearly the wrath that worthless junk deserves), Cruise towers over Damon as a star and makes this kind of similar action fare with much hand to hand combat and typical over-the-top gunplay much more amusing and even sometimes funny compared to the one dimensional dour Bourne franchise.  This movie is also crafted in classical Hollywood manner and therefore trounces that phony cheap handheld consumer level poorly shot documentary simulated rubbish posing as edgy state-of-the-art realism that the stupid filmmakers of the last Bourne so-called film erroneously believe to be engaging to an audience when if the audience and jackass critics were honest, they would clearly and emphatically label as pure s---.

Of course, as with any action film, you have to check the logical part of your brain outside the auditorium.

Come on, it is great, it is fun, seeing Cruise, at the age of 54, fighting 5-6 guys without losing any energy or breathing hard. He wrestles a guy, they fall off a building and he gets punched, kicked in the stomach, legs, in the head and still get up and demolish the other guy!

Does it make a difference what the story is? You know it is about some big organization and the mean CEO and the good guys/gals going after them and you don’t even have to be told who will win.

A bit of a difference here is that he partners with Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders) who keeps up with him running—and there is a lot of running—and fighting the enemy. Another female in the movie is teenager Samantha (Danilka Yarosh), who could or could not be Reacher’s daughter, who brings some humor and smarts as only a teenager can.

Yes there is one fight too many and each is a bit long while we have the action movie mandatory car chases and let’s not forget the hissable villain here played by Patrick Heusinger.

All the heroes, heroines and villains do their job well in the movie and Cruise, though no longer with a 6 pack stomach, but has a shirtless scene, has nothing to be ashamed of and when he threatens to break a man’s arms, legs and neck he does just that, in that order, as easy as he jumps off another building.

“Jack Reacher: Never Go Back” is a fun movie, a movie that we use to run to as kids on a Saturday afternoon and practice the star’s moves on the walk home. Go ahead and relive your childhood or have a second one at a movie house near you. And don’t forget to get a bag of popcorn!"

Tom Cruise and Cobie Smulders do nice enough work with what they were handed.   However, one of the bigger challenges with this film was the dialog.  We would think at this point, that with all the other things vying for our attention, that if a studio is going to go through the effort of funding and making a movie, they would try just a smidge' harder on this now. There are so many wonderful writers out there. But after the first little bit of this film (which was pleasant enough) you'll have to sit through a fair amount of cliche.

Also, as a minor amusing note: whoever approved the wardrobe on this film really likes black. Have fun noticing that.  It's always charming when they show the the trade craft of these various professionals trying to inconspicuously follow each other, all wearing black. The black leather gloves were an especially nice touch!  Bravo!  Oh, that was the villain?! Thank you!  We didn't know.

Bringing her Paris couture skills back home results in an amusing, but somewhat unrealistic infusion of high fashion in the locals. While she tries to reconcile with her mother (Judy Davis) and get to the bottom of her trauma, she's wooed by the local hunk (Liam Hemsworth). There are elements of quirky comedy that sometimes work and sometimes seem forced. More unusual is the especially grim final hour, which upends most of the film's mischievous promise. The dresses are beautiful and the performances are solid, but be prepared to be taken in a dark direction before it's over."
2369,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-dressmaker/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Sep 30, 2016",6,"Judy Davis, as ‘Mad Molly’, almost, at first funnily then smartly, steals the movie right from under everyone’s noses but then gorgeous Liam Hemsworth lets all his masculinity, and bare chest, out and noses are forgotten. The only one who can upstage them, and anyone else on screen, is Kate Winslet, Mad Molly’s daughter, arriving in this isolated town with the first words heard being “I’m back you ****!”

“The Dressmaker” takes place in 1951 and is constantly swinging back and forth from comedy to drama to satire to melodrama, a tale of revenge, murder, paternity, brutality just as Kate Winslet is Susan Hayward from “Back Street” in one scene and then within another scene she is both Mary Astor from ‘The Maltese Falcon” to Rita Hayworth in Gilda and that’s only in the first 10 minutes of the film.

There doesn’t seem to be a ‘normal’ person in Dungater from the local policeman who is a secret course dresser, played by Hugo Weaving, to the town councilor, played by Shane Bourne, who goes to any woman he can get but has a deeper secret. Oh and talking about women this one town has a representation of every woman you can think of with most types of men, too.

The story starts off as a simple one with Tilly, Kate Winslet, having been exiled from the town 25 years previously when a schoolmate, Stewart Pettyman, played by Rory Potter, the son of Evan Pettyman, played by Shane Bourne and Marigold Pettyman, played by Alison Whyte, when he dies with a cracked head and she is the only one to witness it.  Tilly doesn’t remember anything about what happened and after spending the years traveling to Spain, England, France and becoming a dressmaker she returns to take care of her mother and try to find out what happened that day.

“The Dressmaker” is all over the place with a lot of evil and a lot of laughs competing, especially in the second half, but many fine performances and very easy to follow with all that is going on though occasionally the Australian outback accent might be a little hard to understand.

There is a scene worth the price of admission alone where Davis, Winslet and Hemsworth are in a movie house watching Gloria Swanson in “Sunset Boulevard” and you will never be able to watch that film without hearing Davis’s comments in your head.

In many ways “The Dressmaker” is like one of those films ‘they don’t make anymore’ like they did in the 1950s but it will definitely be seen as a guilty pleasure, as I did, and enjoyed every minute but not admit it!"

2376,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/monster-hunter/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Methias,"Oct 15, 2021",6,"As an avid long term fan of the Monster Hunter computer game franchise, I wasn't sure what to expect after I heard about the plot premise of this film, but I decided to watch it all the same and honestly, it was more than what I was expecting. I am neither going to make this review to slam the film or give it praise it doesn't deserve.

What I got in this film was a great look into how the Monster Hunter universe could be very wonderfully adapted to the big screen, but unfortunately, I feel it fell very short with the story. The classic tale of being transported from one world to another is such a too often seen trope, it's become damaging, and that's exactly what I see here. I feel there was no need at all to have this whole military unit of our world being ported to the Monster Hunter world. The actors were great choices in my opinion, but I believe the story would of been far better off just being set solely in the MH universe from the get go, no crazy and out of place teleportation trope needed.

An example I could give of an idea I would of love to of seen would of been the characters we see being taken and trained up as new Monster Hunters, since we see plenty of the skills and weaponry of the world used in the film. This is where I truly saw moments that I absolutely adored. The use of monster parts, the carving up of the bodies, the demon mode of the dual daggers, this was where the film became the most interesting and fun for me. This is, of course, as a long term fan of the computer game series, so it was great to see all of this for me, as I am sure it was for many other fans like myself. For those who do not know the gaming franchise, I can see how that wouldn't have the same effect, but I don't doubt it still would of been interesting.

After all, as a newcomer, you'd be completely introduced to a whole new world and shown how the people of it work with it. Hunting beasts and monsters, using parts of them as armour, weapons and even using venom glands to their advantage. This was all so excellent to see and just fantastically done as this is really the core heart and soul of the Monster Hunter games, going after the next big game to get the parts for new gear and equipment, and it's always so fun to find out what monsters give you what parts.

The films visuals were fantastic. Over the years, I've seen the creatures of the MH universe being shown in greater and greater detail, but seeing them on the big screen in all this special effects glory was definitely a treat. They were done right, right down to the little details, so seeing Diablos and Rathalos among others this way was fantastic.

There were treats for fans of the computer game franchises as well in the scene of the Palico chef cooking up food, almost exactly like it's seen in the game of Monster Hunter World itself. And the fact that it's fundementally the same Palico, going by the scar blinding its left eye, it's a very wonderful nod to the game, something I really appreciated, espcially as he cooked up some meat just like its done in the game. Loved it!

Over all, the film was a chance of showing the Monster Hunter world in a brillant way on the big screen, but it has been hurt, rather sadly, by the fact that the story just isn't as good as it could of been. I never really thought to begin with a live action version of Monster Hunter would ever work, but seeing that this film isn't as awful as I ever expected has given me hope that perhaps there's a chance for a future installment, just with a far better story, if we're lucky. I will always say though, that I think it would do far better as an animated series or film. But only time will tell.

The whole thing gets a 6/10 because the visuals, designs, the Monsters, the weapons and gear as well as the nods to the computer game of Monster Hunter World were all so excellently done that it rescues the film from being one of the worst video game adaptations ever, but the story is what is taking away from it getting a higher score.

Still, if you're a fan of the game franchise, especially Monster Hunter World, it's worth a watch at least once. It's a fun viewing for fans and non-fans."

I've never played the game, so I can't tell you how closely it follows it. I know when you have Tony Jaa you're expecting fight scenes, you get plenty of those, and they're done well.

There were multiple times when my friend and I were watching this together that we started asking why an event was happening for the third time in the film.

Despite this, Hollywood keeps revisiting the era, with 2019’s remake of ‘Midway’ being the most recent example. Directed by Roland Emmerich, ‘Midway’ features plenty of action and special effects, but ultimately fails to stand out from the crowd. Woody Harrelson gives a noteworthy performance as Admiral Nimitz, but the rest of the cast is largely disposable. Dennis Quaid and Aaron Eckhart have minor roles, but their presence is appreciated. All in all, ‘Midway’ is far from a groundbreaking war movie, and viewers may be better off watching ‘Pearl Harbor’ instead.

Woody Harrelson ofrece una actuación notable como el almirante Nimitz, pero el resto del elenco es en gran medida desechable.

O longa aborda o famoso acontecimento de Bay Harbor e como os americanos viraram o jogo, com um enfoque maior nas batalhas e nos personagens. Além de já termos visto isso milhares de vezes, o diretor/roteirista entregam um projeto sem alma e com personagens vazios. Há uma certa ""dinâmica"" entre o lado americano e dos japoneses que não funciona bem - ao menos eles não foram endemonizados como em outros filmes americanos. São cenas vazias que não acrescentam nada de significativo a trama.

O filme demora muito para decolar e, do inicio a metade, há uma sensação de No Clímax, como se não houvesse proposito. Há um apelo ao personagem do **** Best e sua família - claramente não funcionou. O mesmo é irritante, arrogante, e não duraria uma batalha na vida real com suas atitudes - que são exaltadas pelo filme. Os outros personagens são desinteressante e seus problemas tampouco parecem reais.

The Aaron Eckhart's subplot is even more ridculous, following his journey into China then nowhere to be seen till the very end of the film.

The one thing you will notice right away is how much the movie jumps around, and if you don't pay attention, you'll get confused since we are jumping forward in time and in between places frequently and without much warning. Then we have some side plots that go nowhere. This movie could do without the whole Doolittle raid, the submarine, and the director trying to make a movie on midway. It feels like they are trying to fit in as many tidbits of historical info as they can. Instead, it could focus a bit more on midway and everyone stationed there(for a movie about midway, there is awfully little of it) and have more focus on the operation. As it stands there is no build up and you can't definitely tell when the time for the attack has come. To be frank this movie is not that historically accurate either.

One other thing is the CGI. At best it looks like the best from a video game cinematic, at worse it looks like some cable channel's documentary.

About the acting I think it was ok, the actors gave their best. But they weren't given much time or space to breat as the movie just jumped around constantly.

It tries to resemble old glories and strives to give the spectator a good representation of the historical facts that happened before the Battle of Midway.

It is certainly BETTER than Pearl Harbor, but it's sluggish on most of the scenes before the actual battle. There are many characters involved so you have to keep your attention up and running, especially if you are not a history buff or you do not know what happened in the Battle itself.

The air battles are good, but sometimes, especially in the Pearl Harbor introduction, feel ARCADEISH and GAMEY. But the graphical representation of a task force at sea seems to be taken directly from photographs of the era.

Dive bombing attacks are done really well but exaggerated in some points due to drama and script requests.

Midway, in the end, is a DECENT war movie, it has the taste of old glories with a side of modern quirks. Does this save the movie ?

Nope. But it's 'fun'. Definitely not for the historical buff, but it's ok."

It’s not a good movie but it’s not terrible but what do I expect from director Roland Emmerich. It’s definitely one of his better films but that isn’t saying a lot. This has to be one of the worst scripts of the year. Every single line of dialogue was awful and insufferable. It was obvious that all the film cared about was its visual effects instead of its script and characters. Even though the characters are based on real people, they still feel very bland and boring. I don’t know why they put Nick Jonas in this movie other than to just have him in the film. The acting from most of them isn’t half bad. They are trying their hardest with the material they are given and do a good job for what the film is going for. Aaron Eckhart for his limited screen time probably gives the best performance of the entire film. Ed Skrein does a pretty terrible American accent though. There were aspects to the presentation of the film I did appreciate. Before I saw the film, I did some research on the Battle of Midway and the film was actually very historically accurate. The dive bombers did miss a lot of shots and maybe only one or two would manage to land a hit on the Japanese carriers. While some may call that cheesy within the film, it was historically accurate. I also like how the film didn’t demonize the Japanese unlike a certain 2001 film (Pearl Harbor). It shows them as human too and that they were doing what they had to do to protect themselves and to follow orders. The action scenes weren’t half bad but mostly forgettable although some scenes did look really cool. The visual effects weren’t that bad either. They were pretty meh in the beginning but they got better as the film went along. Another thing I will give the film credit for was that it was for the most part entertaining. I didn’t ever feel bored even with the 2 and a half hour runtime but that might be an issue for some. The music sounded like stock war film music and there was a large amount of war film cliches thrown into the film which were very obnoxious. Some scenes are loud enough where some actors have to overdub their voices but it wasn’t properly synced up at some points which took me out of the film a little. Overall, Midway may be entertaining and very historically accurate but it falls victim to an awful script, bland characters, and too many typical war film cliches."

This is helmed by disaster movie director Roland Emmerich. He is a guy who found his voice in the 90's, and this movie kind of feels like it was made during that decade. The execution is too light for its own good. I don't mean this in a complimentary way. Dialogue is undercooked and at times cliched. I felt like a lot of good actors were wasted here. There is a lot of quick jumping from scene-to-scene. Yes, I know this is one of those war movies that look at many players, but even by the standards of these types of films, the scenes often don't hold weight.

Also, this movie feels kind of odd for today. More recent war movies have tried to look at the more realistic and darker elements of the subject and the human toll and psychology of it all. Not that this movie isn't about human sacrifice, but this tries to be more of a crowdpleaser like the war films of yesteryear. It feels out of place in today's climate.    Of course, I could just be jaded. If you want to see movie honoring those who died for our county, then this might be for you. The movie does a good job of laying out how the battle of Midway went down on both the American and Japanese fronts and evoking the old feel of wide-scale military battle films. Emmerich maintains his eye for action. The combat scenes are all done well. The computer graphics aren't the best; none of them look realistic enough. In Emmerich's defense, I give him credit for showing a lot of them during full daylight scenes, which is trickier than doing them during night or in grey/blue lighting. Also, props to hair and costumes in this. Overall, this is a movie that looks good enough but just doesn't stand out."

As a result, it's a choppy chronicle that doesn't succeed well at creating a compelling story of his career or his personal life. You could probably read Wikipedia and get the same info. Brit actor Tom Hiddleston inhabits the character, thick Southern accent and all. His performance is charismatic and his singing is impressive. There are brief performance excerpts of Williams' greatest hits and plenty of him drinking and having challenging relationships with women. The pacing stays at the same medium level throughout, which doesn't make for dynamic cinema. The whole film feels choppy and incomplete, never taking the time to create any depth and true appreciation for this talented artist."

Michael Bryce (Reynolds) is a triple A rated private bodyguard in the United Kingdom until he lost this status due to his client being assassinated under his watch. Two years later, the ruthless dictator of Belarus, Vladislav Dukhovich (Oldman) is on trial for his crimes against humanity at International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands.

After for so long that there was no solid evidence or testimony against Dukhovich, the only hope for the prosecution team is Darius Kincaid (Jackson), a notorious hitman who was once associated with Dukhnovich. He agrees to testify against him in exchange for his wife’s release from prison. Interpol Agent Amelia Roussel, who is also the ex-girlfriend of Bryce suspects there is a mole inside the agency due to attempt assassination of Kincaid. She contacts Bryce for help to protect Kincaid. Bryce now has to protect Kincaid and bring him to The Hague while fending off any attempt assassination on him.

The plot of this movie is really too cliché and overused by many other buddy cop genre movies. It was really nothing new at all. There are lots of funny moments but at times, I was kind of bored in some scenes and hoping for the movie to end faster. The plot could have been better but the execution was too poor.

Aside from the plot, the performance of Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson are amazing and they worked extremely well with each other on screen. If you are fan of Marvel movies, you can imagine Deadpool and Nick Fury working together and throwing jabs at each other the same time. However, Salma Hayek’s character was really wasted in this role and does absolutely nothing to contribute to the plot. Gary Oldman’s role was wasted too as he had little screen time despite being the main villain.

Although I do not really recommend this movie, you should watch it if you are a fan of Ryan Reynolds and/or Samuel L. Jackson. Just watch the movie with low expectations to avoid disappointment or don’t watch at all."

2421,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-hitmans-bodyguard/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,NightReviews,"Sep 26, 2017",4,"Motherf*cker!

If there is one actor who has single-handedly perfected the execution, nuance and delivery of the word motherf*cker, there is only one name people really need to think about, and you can bet your bottom-dollar it is none other than the always entertaining and widely available (I mean the guy is in everything, someone give his agent an Academy Award already) Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson, who has close to two-hundred acting credits to his name, can basically pull off anything; action, adventure, drama, comedy and of course, well…as I mentioned, anything. This time around, Jackson decides to pull of working next to a post-Deadpool Ryan Reynolds, and thankfully, given the absolutely hysterical and effortless chemistry between the two, allows The Hitman’s Bodyguard to be an easy to swallow throwback action comedy duo film.

The Hitman’s Bodyguard is a very campy yet guilt-ridden entertaining action comedy film that pays homage to so many films and instances of the nineteen-ninteis. Right out of the gates, in the film’s first theatrical trailer, it begins and ends with the extremely famous and recognizable motion picture soundtrack hit “I Will Always Love You”, which belongs to, and still is, one of the most purchased movie soundtracks of all-time. In addition to stealing The Bodygaurd’s music, the first theatrical poster for the film is a very direct spoof to the theatrical poster as well, therefore cementing its nostalgic feel, even before watching it. Playing out action, comedy, romance and [somewhat] drama much like the early Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme actioners that once made these names household names, two of the best one-line giving A-list actors team up to give us the last fun-filled summer movie of 2017, and just in the nick of time, before all of big serious film festivals and Oscar hopeful award films.

While the premise of The Hitman’s Bodyguard is nothing to marvel at, just the idea of Ryan Reynold’s Michael Bryce, a straight-laced, by the numbers and mathematical AAA rated executive protection agent guarding Jackson’s world renown assassin; a foul-mouth and reckless Darius Kincaid, had me hooked immediately. I mean, come on! These are two actors with such expansive filmography’s that, we all know both are at liberty to add so much of their own personal comedy and selves into roles that are, essentially, caricatures of all the great and painfully pleasing characters of our childhoods. Plus, the direct comparison of Reynold’s Bryce to his recent discovery of bad-ass, fourth wall-breaking anti-heroes, is just a fun pace for the actor.

Joining in the fun, is the always transparent Gary Oldman, who can play every bad guy in film, from now until its eventual extinction. Playing a ruthless Eastern European dictator, who must do anything and everything to destroying Kincaid, before he is able to testify him in the court of law, adds to the nineties nostalgia and camp in ways that only Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Sschwarzenegger could understand. Additionally, the film was also able to nab the always cunning Richard E. Grant; the kick-ass young Elodie Yung, and not to mention, the scene-stealing Salma Hayek, who plays the fouled mouth, violent and enraged Sonia Kincaid.

While this is one film in 2017 where everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, seemed to have fun making, this is a film that radiates a good-time. Sure, the editing isn’t seemingless, the foreshadowing may be all-too obvious, the action is rushed and jumbled up into very incoherent forays, but The Hitman’s Bodyguard is very aware of the film it is, and what it wants to be and what it wants the audience to get from it; which is, good-ol’ popcorn fun.

One of the strengths of The Hitman’s Bodyguard is the time it takes with comedy; incorporating music, song, and somewhat choreographed sing-alongs, including the one-hit wonder “I Saw the Sign” into the film, Bodyguard is able to deviate away from the action timing and saturated placement of explosions, car chases and bar brawls that, at times, feel forced.

While the summer 2017 was anything less than impressive, this film will surely not be the one to injected some much needed life into the box-office. Don’t let this fool you though, the end of August marks the end of the summer movie season, and although everyone knows that the end of August films are more of a dumping ground to recoup budgets and fulfill studio contracts, The Hitman’s Bodyguard doesn’t look to face much competitive until the first week of September, where I am sure will be faced with horrifying results, once Pennywise and the new remake of It is released."

The interplay takes advantage of each actor's style: self-depreciating, offhand wry comments from Reynolds and profanity-laden, raucous attitude from Jackson. To make this work, the chemistry needs to be there…it's OK.  Without their special delivery, the terse chatter would fall flat. Meanwhile, the bodyguard's relationship with his ex is trite and dull.

OK so it's definitely not a masterpiece and the best thing about it by far are it's stars, Reynolds and Jackson. The story is pretty flat but these guys manage to keep it entertaining throughout. As an unlikely duo, in my opinion, they actually played off each other very well. Salma Hayek has a superb cameo and I would loved to have seen more of her, she was hilarious! Gary Oldman showed up and just blew everyone else off the screen as you'd expect from such a veteran. As for the negatives, aside from the paper thin plot, some of the cast disappointed. Elodie Yung as Ryan's love interest was incredibly wooden and obviously so next to the much more experienced leads. Her character was meant to be a tough FBI agent and she did not manage to portray that at all. Honestly, I feel the blame lies more with miscasting than anything else. There were some action scenes towards the end of the film where the audio soundtrack was completely out of balance with the sound fx. It jarred so much it utterly distracted me and I've never made that complaint before.

Overall, I'd recommended this movie if you're a Reynolds or Jackson fan or if you want some good laughs without having to turn your brain on for a bit. Don't get too taken in by the blah reviews, I found it pretty entertaining, lighthearted and definitely worth a look."

Ryan and Samuel bickering in the car, Ryan and Samuel bickering during a shootout, Ryan and Samuel bickering during another shootout but this time with speedboats and motorcycles. It’s Ryan Reynolds doing his thing and Samuel L. Jackson doing his thing. Throw in a stereotypical bad guy played by Gary Oldman and voilà. You’re left with everything you’ve seen before only worse. It really is amazing to see an action movie fail at the one thing it’s expected to deliver…the action. It fails because at no point are these characters in any danger, it handles violence in the same way as a cartoon only without the humour. Not only that but any attempt at comedy is let down by the trailers. When you’ve seen Ryan Reynolds being thrown out a car windshield for the past few weeks leading up to the film’s release then it has well and truly lost any impact it hoped to achieve. Boring, bland and unengaging. If you want an over the top action movie you’d be better off watching Face Off, it’s twice as ridiculous and thoroughly entertaining. Not recommended unless you really are starved for this week’s popcorn flick. In that case enter at your own risk."

It’s a fine mainstream action comedy about two loved movie stars arguing, cursing, and eliminating lots of big men armed with big guns.
Theres a ton of shooting, fighting, car chases (also a motorboat chase), explosions, and a half-amusing appearance by Salma Hayek who also curses a lot.
The characters and story are as generic as they can come, the main aim to emulate the exciting mix of humor and violence that worked so well for „Deadpool“ – 2016’s comic superhero movie starring Reynolds, bringing 783 million dollars from cinemas.
""Deadpool's"" mix works well here too. The only problem is the big amount of secondary filler material.
You could easily remove most of the stuff concerning dictator and bodyguard’s former girlfriend, and the result wouldn’t be worse in any way. It would be even better, probably, because the 118 minute running length is a bit much.

They usually fail to capture any of the magic of the original or bring any worthwhile new ideas to the table. That isn't so much the case here. It's got a few cool new ideas. but ultimately it's definitely not as good as the original. However rather than being awful what we have is more of a boring affair.

It's most exciting moments are when it is recreating scenes from the original with it's own twists. These scenes bring back fond memories of the original, but don't really make much of an impression on their own, with the exception of the clown scene.

Part of what made the original Poltergeist so fantastic was the characters. They were likable, real, and made us care about them. There are some talented actors playing these new interpretations of them, and they do have some real world problems and interactions. The problem is that they feel just like the average modern horror movie protagonists. By that I mean they feel like faceless character types with no depth created for the sole purpose of screaming at scary stuff.

Considering this is a horror movie, one of the most important aspects I need to touch on when reviewing it is whether or not it is scary. It's not. Creepy specters show their ugly faces and people get grabbed, but there's never a sense of fear or urgency from the film. This might be partly due to the fact that many of us have seen the original. This remake doesn't deviate too far from it so those of us who have seen it already know what's going to happen.

That being said, I doubt those experiencing Poltergeist for the first time this way are likely to be frightened. It's pretty tame and by the numbers. At least it doesn't rely on jump scares, so there's that.

Honestly I just recommend watching the original. This remake isn't bad and has a talented cast. Some of the original's humor finds it's way here as well. None of that changes the fact that this is still a pretty boring horror movie that's devoid of any frights. It's not as bad as most horror movie remakes, and honestly it isn't really that bad at all. However none of that changes the fact that there are plenty of more entertaining options out there, as well as the infinitely superior original. If you've already exhausted your other options though, this isn't that bad."

Not saying its perfect either. For a horror movie, it isn't really scary. A few jump scares here and there, but that'sit.

I thought the best thing about the movie were the special effects and a very good twist creating scenes in the world of the dead.

This movie is a like nice looking juicy steak sitting on a plate.  You cut into it and take a bite and it doesn't taste like anything."

Unnecessary to compare this with the original and I tried, but impossible to avoid it since it's an official remake. Everything, from the house to frame by frame, all the scenes looked the same, except the cast and it's set in the present world with the daily life's modern gadgets. If you had not seen the 80s film, then there's a little chance you might like it. Though it was not a serious horror movie, or a scary movie to consider, still quite enjoyable like a dark comedy in parts. But I recommend the old one.

Really? Sam Rockwell? He did not fit in the role, just okay though. And the kids, did not impress me as like the original movie. The only upgrade in this new version was the technology, CRT monitors to LED kind of stuffs. I expected a major, at least a bit alteration in the story or the screenplay that sets in a different circumstances and the location. That could have been a lot better. Disappoints for those who loved the first version. However, that movie deserved to be remade, and I did not think it would end like this. Hoping for a better sequel, but I'm already feeling that would end in the hands of the second string cast and crew which could be a cheap horror-thrill.

The Good: At times, the film is a nice ode to the original, repeating some of the scenes from the horror classic without copying them directly.  I thought that Sam Rockwell would be somewhat out of place, but he did a solid job. Jared Harris, as usual, turns in a good performance as television occultist Carrigan Burke, who is brought in to try and save the family's daughter. When they show what the ""other side"" looks like, it is very well done. While there are only a few of these scenes (mostly towards the end), they are hands down the best parts of the movie.

The Bad: Sadly, for a horror and suspense film, it's not even remotely scary or suspenseful. Films like this are usually chock full of ""jumpy"" scenes, but this one was devoid of even that. It also goes from a somewhat slow build up to full throttle out of the blue which was a little jarring. Unfortunately, this movie is no better than the rest of the lazy horror films that have been released in the last 5-10 years."

Good:
1. This remake is pretty darn close to the original film from 1982. Many modern remakes these days significantly deviate from the original. Poltergeist is different. they kept the story the same, the family the same, the names the characters the same, and even some references from the original film. I give them credit for not changing it too much.
2. practical effects: although there defiantly some CGI effects throughout the movie, a lot of the effects were performed old school, by means of practical effects (effects not created through the use of computers or software of any kind).

Bad:
1. Acting: Usually acting does not bother me as much if the story is captivating. But in this case I believe they tried too hard to stump the original. The acting was subpar, with the only good acting performed by the father who is played by Sam Rockwell. The rest are pretty mediocre.

2. Remaking a classic: I know I said earlier that I give them credit for trying to remake this movie, but I would have given them even more credit if they came up with a new original idea. I would have rather them have made a new sequel.

3. Modernization: I maybe would have given these title a 7/10 if they did not modernize everything. If they kept in in the same time period as the original one from 1982. that would have made the film a bit more interesting at least.

Overall this remake of the 1982 horror classic is subpar, 6/10 being a very very generous rating on my part. In general if you like these kind of movies go ahead and watch it, I have no guarantee you will like it though."

If comedy is barely present in the new movie, horror is bigger, thanks to special effects and scary moments with a more real touch. Details of the supernatural world are amazing and Madison is a quite charming character so it kinda helps you getting involved with the story. The major problems of Poltergeist are in the script, which is told on screen in a rush and it's annoying to watch how things happen so fast, with such a poor development of characters. If you are a horror fan, you can have a few scary moments here but nothing unforgetable. If you watched the original of 1982, you might be surprised with the speed of events but you might be more scared too. It's your choice."

I would refrain from calling it a disastrous re-make, but I would hardly call it a good one!  Everything just feels a lot like you are watching the first film, but with a lot less!  What this film really needed was a better screenplay writer and a better director, because I think there was every possibility that this film could have been better.  As it stands, just see the original, there is really no need to see this one.  The effects are less good, the actors are less good, the plot’s less good, everything is just less good!!

In those films a psychic showed up to help a family with supernatural problems and brought a team along to record their findings. Despite both being good films I already felt like I was watching two Poltergeist remakes.
The remake is better than they say due to a good cast and decent enough acting. Besides the Conjuring and Insidious it seems like movies about ghosts targeting a family come out 2-3 times a year these days. So there's just nothing fresh this remake could give us that wasn't done in recent movies or especially the classic original.
The best thing about the movie is that Sam Rockwell (The Green Mile, Iron Man 2) for some reason is in this as the father. He is believable and makes a good replacement for the original father who was played by Craig T. Nelson. What's missing though is the smart humor of the original. The mom putting a football helmet on the daughter and then putting her on a spot of the kitchen floor that magically pushes objects across the room. Was funny in the original and yes bad parenting. This movie tries too hard to be scary and lacks the originals sense of humor.
I watched the original last week; the film still works and I can't say updated effects made this remake superior in anyway. Which goes for pretty much every remake these days. While it's hardly Poltergeist without Zelda Rubinstein who was great as the psychic in the original."

The story is about a contemporary reimagination of a suburban family dealing with a series of unexplained phenomena revolving around their youngest daughter. When the restless spirits get more and more violent, they call on outside help, not knowing just how dangerous things are going to get.

I still have no idea why they did a remake on Poltergeist and why Hollywood keeps making remakes in the first place. These just no point and it anyone's me that these people think they can top the original but always fail because you can't top the original unless your John Carpenter and you made The Thing then yeah good job you somehow top the original. But I also curious of how this was going to turn, I mean Hollywood must have learned from they mistakes by now by not adding any stupid CG monsters or loud jump scares. After seeing the movie I'm still not impressed.

The only good thing in this movie was Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt and Jared Harris. Those three were the only good actors in the movie and at least they tried to give a some what **** performance, they tried they best and I can give them that. But I still have no idea why they here in the first place, maybe it's money or they got force to do it, I don't know maybe it's just the money and if that's the case these three acted they ass off to get that paycheck.

The movie itself has some creative scares or creepy moments I like to call it. When I mean some I really do mean some of the scares in the movie, which is kind of surprising that must remakes normally just **** all the way. Gil Kenan directed this movie and he's also the same guy who did Monster House and that movie itself had it's creepy moments and it also involves a possessed house and I think some of the creativity that Gil Kenan had went into this movie.

I've seen many horror remakes that are much much worse then this. At least this one tried a little hard from most remakes, because a lot of horror remakes today are just so freaking lazy and they don't put any effort at all in they movies and it just comes off as crapping on the original.

Now for the problems and these a lot to bring up: There is way way too much CGI in the movie I mean Hollywood horror movie cliche bad. These a scene in this movie where a CG squirrel jumps out the wardrobe (like a jump scare) and the way it ran around and how it looked just made me put my hands smack down on my face with pure disappointment of what I just saw. And that's not all, these other scenes where it involves CG with the demon ghost and other object's trying to kill them. People in Hollywood if you see this review (Somehow) stop making scary things into CGI crap, it's not scary it just make you look cheap. Go back to old school practical effect's with make-up and hairstyle in horror movies, at least it's actually there and it doesn't look like a crappy looking computer bug.

Every advertisement for this movie has been for the f**king clown. It doesn't really scare me anymore because everywhere I go I see a billboard advertisement and you know what's on there? this movie with the clown facing us, I mean everywhere I go I see the damn thing and it's not even creepy anymore, it's just annoying how it's everywhere and how they showing the clown too much. I mean is that the way the film makers behind this movie think that the clown is going to make me run out of my way to see this movie, thank god we got online piracy because I'm paying to this a horror remake and that clown isn't going to fool me, I watched it for free so HA. Yeah you can saw it worked as I have seen the movie and reviewing it as I speak, but let's not forget I sawed it online for FREE and didn't pay to see it, that's why it's number 4 on this week box office.

The child actors in the movie are not very good. I know it may seem a bit mean for me saying that the kids in the movie are piss poor actors but again let's not forget here that we have seen great performance from child actors in past horror movies so that proves that some children can act in horror movies, but here it seems like the producer's wanted they kids in the movie to make money and get to they children famous = more money. The little girl in the movie of course plays with the ghost demons and here's the thing in these kind of movies, what's up with these kids not once getting a bit freaked out over this I mean kids will cry or get scared over anything that's not human. The two movies that I think of that did it realistically was in The Babadook and The Conjuring were the kids got pure scared of this thing and not once played with it.

The movie overall doesn't do anything new with it's character's, it's story or anything really. I bet this remake will be forgotten at the end of the year, unless they do a squeal (which I hope doesn't happening)."
2458,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/poltergeist/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,davidprice96,"May 24, 2015",5,"I went into this movie not having seen the original, so I'm not sure how this movie compares to it. But here's my opinion:

The entire cast is pretty bland. The actors did a decent job (especially the kids) but because of the lack of character development, which was desperately needed, I had no emotional attachment to the any of the characters. The plot was also a bit lacking; very little was explained and the ending was SOOOO lame that the movie left a bitter taste in my mouth.

So if the character development and plot are lacking then the movie should certainly make up for it through its special effects and scariness right? Well the former is actually the highlight of the movie but the latter is actually my least favorite thing about the movie. I'll go ahead and say it. This movie is not scary in any sense. Their are a handful of jump-scares, but they barely even made me flinch. I was practically BEGGING the movie to scare me around half way through, and I ended up being disappointed. The trailer is scarier than the movie. The poster that you've probably seen in movie theaters with the clown doll on it is scarier than the movie. The dark parking lot that I had to walk through to get back to my car after watching the movie was - you guessed it - scarier than the movie.

Is this movie bad? No. It kept my interest through its entirety because of its special effects and cool set pieces. But I expect a horror movie to keep me on the edge of my seat for the whole movie. I was never on the edge of my seat in this movie.

Bottom line:
If you want to go to this movie for the scares (like I did)  - STAY AWAY.
If a haunted house movie with cool special effects sounds appealing to you - See it.
If you're on the fence, I would definitely say pass.

If you're considering watching this in 3D, DON'T. I have tried for years to convince myself that 3D could actually add depth to movies (no pun intended), but this movie reinforces my belief that 3D is just a gimmick to milk more money out of movie-goers like myself."

But besides that, the action was quite good, especially the last sequence. Acting was okay, even for the children. Poltergeist isn't a film that will give me nightmares anytime soon, but it was a decent way to spend a Saturday night.

Problem number 2 is more serious and goes to the heart of the film, ‘Poltergeist’ is not the worst remake of a classic horror film, in fact it may be the best, but like all the others it’s underwhelming and completely redundant.

So what’s the purpose?, to get butts in cinema seats of course and we can’t blame 20th Century Fox for that, but we can’t forgive the premium charged for perhaps the most pointless 3D ever which further entrenches our position that, for the most part, 3D remains a gimmick that doesn’t enhance the cinematic experience.

So what we’re left with is a film that in isolation is a decent suspenseful horror that’s somewhat family friendly and well crafted, but nothing exists in isolation so ‘Poltergeist’ is just another example of how horror remakes don’t work, whether you stay faithful to the original or re-invent the scary wheel.

The Bottom Line…
Slick, suspenseful and scary, ‘Poltergeist’ might be worth a cinema trip for those who haven’t seen the original, for those who have there’s really nothing here for you and for everyone, we strongly suggest watching the 1982 original."

Okay now that the basics are gone, this was actually a good movie. Good. Not great. It's obviously more inspired by the likes of Insidious than the original Poltergeist, which does make this significantly different than the original. It's certainly not a shot-for-shot remake. The first act is really busy with a lot of scares popping out at you like a haunted house at a carnival, but some of them are very well constructed. After calling the paranormal investigators, it does become significantly more tame. It's never boring, but the scares die down after the 30 minute mark. The scares also get a little more intelligent. There's one scene in particular involving a drill that could rival anything from the original movie. It's a very scary and clever scene that is certainly the most memorable part of the movie. The performances from a majority of the cast are very good, especially Sam Rockwell. What surprised me most was the last 15 minutes. It went a direction I certainly didn't expect, and it ended the movie very well. The biggest problem with this movie is that it is underwhelming for the most part, and the short running time doesn't allow the viewer to really connect to the family. Poltergeist is still a satisfying and worthy remake of the classic; just don't expect to lose any sleep over it."

Being a B movie, it is not that bad. It is eligible for some minor exceptions and if you consider that while watching it, then it does not disappoint much. Yes, there are many similar films like this, but what makes it somewhat special is that it is quite freely explored its contents without stressing out on detailing everything. I meant it was a simple road adventure film and you would feel it very familiar yet you will realise that it is not worth criticing it.

The actors were decent, but expected much better. Directed by a newcomer who had written many screenplays similar this theme. Like I said it was quite predictable, at a time decently enjoyable with a few laughs now and then, especially that Mexican police station scene was hilarious. You might get a million reasons to dislike it, but you achieve nothing from it.

I am not saying the film was terrible, but the timing was bad. There are loads of great sci-fi films were made recently and still coming out. So to compete with them, they have to go through alteration, even if they loose the origins of their film's theme concept. This story is same as many similar themed flicks. For me, it looked like a mini Superman film, but made for kids.

The best thing about it was, keeping everything simple. And then the pace, which actually somewhat saved the film. I hooked to it from the beginning till the conclusion, but familiarity is what killed my interest and entertainment. The characters were okay, not developed well enough. But keeping young audience in mind, it does good. Because going deep is unnecessary stretch.

The story of a high school boy who transferred back to a small town where has born. As he begins to hear a lot about his father from the local people, he becomes motivated to know more about him. But one day when something goes wrong, the next day he wakes up with great power. Not knowing how to handle it, he befriends with an unusual creature and together they fight those who are after them.

Initially I thought it was related to 'Real Steel', but realised only while watching it it is completely different. From the director of 'Sorority Row', I think he did nothing wrong. Those who watch less films would enjoy it better. Visually okay, with all those graphics. Since it is PG13, I would say the target audience is the little ones. So from their perspective, it is acceptable. But I warn the grownups, stay away, or be like them while watching it, in order to get entertained.

Other than IMDb where it stands average, the movie was slammed very badly by the critics and moviegoers. I have seen even worse than this one. So to me it is an average except the end, otherwise below average. Yes, the conclusion was terrible, seems like they don't want a continuation. I mean they wanted to end it all here itself. It is a watchable, but simply not the best one.

Considering the source material from which this movie came I actually thought it wasn't bad.  I am not saying it was great, far from it, but it isn't as bad as I was lead to believe.  Apart from the performances of a couple of actors I was entertained more often then not.  Yes the ending is convoluted and maybe isn't earned and yes there are characters that seem only to be there for exposition and nothing else but there is still something at the base of this movie that made me keep watching.  Again I am not saying it was great, but I think there is a seed of something here that, with a little less melodrama and little more character backstory could actually make an interesting remake for a streaming service. Unfortunately I can't see anyone taking the chance on it so this is all you get, but if you give it a watch, tell me you can't see the potential for something interesting."

It was fine. Entertaining even. The cast is solid and while the premiss gets lost in the slippery plot, it sticks to their mythos and features some perfectly fine twists as to what is going on. The big reveal was what brought the movie down for me personally, but I thought that it fit well with the narrative that they had designed for the back story. I will say though that they also borrowed heavily from the TV series ""Lost."" Right down to the casting of someone who I thought for a second was a digitally de-aged Matthew Fox at the first shot he was in. All in all if you like lite-horror and can handle a slight grade above a B movie then this should be an okay watch. Fun even with the scenes with Dax and Jimmy.

El enigmático Sr. Roarke hace realidad los sueños de los afortunados huéspedes que acuden a su lujoso y remoto resort tropical. Sin embargo, sus fantasías se convertirán en pesadillas, y los invitados deberán resolver el misterio que oculta la isla para poder escapar con vida.

Opinión:

La trama es interesante, tiene relativos momentos de entretención, pero el guión es un verdadero desastre, cuyo desarrollo no tiene pies ni cabeza, al principio todo marcha bien, hasta que los personajes comienzan a volver realidad sus fantasías y es aquí donde todo empieza a salir mal, cada situación a nivel individual es demasiado inverosímil y tirada de los cabellos tanto que deja de ser divertido, hasta los personajes son desastrosos.

NO LA RECOMIENDO.

This weekend we were able to view Fantasy Island, as well. Fantasy Island is a horror adaptation/perversion of the old TV show from the 70's. The movie stars a cast of characters headlined by Lucy Hale, Michael Pena and Maggie Q. But should people go to the theater to view this movie?

Let's start with the easiest way to describe this movie, which is if Shutter Island had a baby with Inception and one of the grandparents was Fantasy Island the TV show. If you've seen those two movies before, WHICH I STRONGLY RECOMMEND DOING IF YOU HAVEN'T, then you know just how deceptive, convoluted, and involved this movie is trying to be. Now, that description could be a compliment but in this situation, it is not. Fantasy Island does not measure up to either movie yet it essentially steals elements of both. Even though it is billed as a horror film, the viewer is deceived because Fantasy Island falls more into the Shutter Island psychological thriller realm than pure horror. The other elements of the movie fall more into the Inception Sci-Fi/Thriller realm. Either way, Fantasy Island fails to have a distinct intent and it's supposed genre was never fully embraced.

Furthermore, the movie is so twisted that it straightens itself out before the two final twist reveals. Just listen to how confusing that statement was. Fantasy Island tried so hard to keep viewers on their toes that they ruin their own anti-climatic twists. I will give credit to the producers that the twists were still executed well but they lacked umph. The viewer is left unafraid due to the overly complicated storytelling and plot developments. It would have served the movie well to just be classified more like the previous movies mentioned, rather than not delivering on the horror genre.

Even with those issues, the cast was sub-par. Individually, the actors were average, but collectively, the actors were still just average. Lucy Hale was by far the best performance at times but still was annoying. I feel Michael Pena was underutilized and or the writing and directing just squandered the possibility of the character. In fact, all of the ensemble cast had issues of being extremely annoying. Now, that I think about it, the writing in this movie was just poor overall. AH HA, found the issue.

With that said, de plane de plane… *clears throat* excuse me. Fantasy Island is a letdown for a horror movie but in a way could have succeeded as a Sci-Fi, psychological thriller. The storyline is not original, which is why they tried to make it so confusing. Or should I say a fantasy within a fantasy within a fantasy. Did they just successfully create an inception?! Either way, you can see this at a matinee time but you’re best served waiting for this to come on HBO Go or a streaming service."

It's really full of a lot of genres and crazy moments, albeit some slightly forced and last-minute plot twists, but it also gave me some serious 'The Cabin in the Woods' vibes while watching it! Overall, it's just a dumb fun movie to sit back and relax to! Never mind that it's a ridiculous attempt at a reboot of a classic TV series and you might enjoy it."

And judging by the premise, this movie should be a real tearjerker.

Almost every scene aims to pull at your heartstrings with a cheesy unimaginative script, topped off with a really flat directing."
2499,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-family-man/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,KaptenVideo,"Aug 1, 2017",6,"Ah, the new movie starring Gerard Butler, the poor man’s Clive Owen, always up for some good all-American entertainment that makes you think but also makes you smile.
This one’s about a headhunter whose life revolves around closing deals in survival-of-the-fittest boiler room. He battles his top rival for control of the company, but then his oldest child falls seriously ill.
Also starring, Gretchen Mol as the loving but ever-suffering wife, Willem Dafoe as the ruthless boss, Alison Brie as the rival and Alfred Molina as the token solid supporting male character.
First and foremost, „A Family Man“ is a genre movie, which means it’s produced and put together of cliches in hope of finding a suitable mainstream audience.
The approach is pretty solid one, using several drama subgenres in order to appeal to wider circle of cinema-goers, including sick child story, a middle class American success story, finding yourself again story and some „Wall Street“ type high-octane competence porn.
The execution is actually pretty solid too. The able cast are doing their darndest best to act through all the material, and there’s a lot of it.
108 minute movie may feel quite a bit longer, at least for those who have seen way too many movies to take all these cliches and workmanlike storytelling seriously.
On the other hand, those who still watch movies as just a nice way of passing time, or aren’t tired of bland dramas made of middle-class dreams and aspirations, can definitely find some entertainment here.
They don’t even have to think how to feel because the movie manipulates you in all the right directions at the right time.
I am taking a wild guess that ""A Family Man"" is most suitable for girlish audience, but it will also surely feel in the right place when it’s 2 am and you’re desperately trying to find something new to watch with Butler starring in it.
He’s a doing a fine job too, the whole result relies on his manly charm and grunting.
All in all, there’s nothing wrong with „A Family Man“. It’s just there’s nothing terribly exciting either, with the creative bar set relatively low and all.
I hope I didn’t sound too ironic here or something, I quite liked the movie for what it is."

Honestly don't know how Gerard Butler got to such a low profile movie, but despite his (or his agent's) choice he does a great job at delivering his character, I think that it fit him perfectly. The directors style in cinematography was just the usual stuff, nothing new. Despite the two protagonists the rest of the characters writing was painfully average, and the script was cliche. The visual looked very weird in some instances when it was CGI, because of the poor way it was generated. The pacing issue is present here as well, although it can keep the audience engaged the whole way through the movie. The plot is simple, and the base of it was recycled so many times that is painful in movie since we learned about global warming. This is the message as well of the movie, but there are just so many that deliver the message in a better fashion. The movie although it was entertaining for most of the part, it wasn't as much fun to watch it.

The movie is filled with profanity-laced sex puns, shock humor, and gross out gags. It's shear devotion to raunch and vulgarity does lead to some amusing moments and laugh-out-loud funny one-liners, but the movie is still hindered by the fact that it's just not very clever. Not even having legendary actor Robert De Niro and Zac Efron, who is ever-growing in popularity in this kind of scene, as the leads can save ""Dirty Grandpa"" from feeling rather thrown together. The movie tries for some of that feel good, family sticking together magic with a side of ""just live"" message. None of that ever really works out. The movie is about the crudity, everything else second. While this does lead to a rather cheap feeling experience, it's something that probably works in Dirty Grandpa's favor. It's evident that the people behind this aren't exactly the deepest of people. **** jokes are right up their alley, and hey, they're good at making them. Mostly. While it's not always the funniest or even the most original film out there in the ever-widening sea of R-rated comedies, there are some laughs to be had. Plus, all of the actors were totally on board with the project. There are some surprisingly good performances here. The supporting cast is also pretty great. Particularly Jason Mantzoukas, who regularly brings some of the biggest laughs. Everyone onscreen is so good you almost want to see them in something with more brains behind it. For a movie this vulgar, raunchy, immature, inappropriate, and sex-obsessed, I can't think of a score any more fitting of it than a 6.9/10."

The jokes are hit-and-miss but they hit really well. De Niro and Efron are really funny too. Not good but funny enough.
2527,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,BrianMcCritic,"May 18, 2016",4,This is a standard raunchy comedy that has some laughs.  It also has no coherent plot and has some moments that seem just mean spirited.  Efron and De Niro try their best but most of the time they fall short.  C-

Robert De-Niro makes another career-ruining decision, but Zac Efron is really good at these R-rated comedies (even if there crappy like Awkward Moment and this one), but it's outrageously funny with DeNiro's insolent one-liners, Efron attempts the straight man in a comedy,  we have ourselves a strange outrageously funny comedy. Zac Efron plays Jason, he's a lawyer who ditched his dreams of photography, to take a job at his father's (Dermot Mulroney) law firm, who's about to marry his **** shrew fiance (Julianne  Hough). Robert DeNiro plays Grandpa ****, after his wife's funeral Jason agrees to take **** to his home in Florida. They pare up in Daytona Beach, all Grandpa **** wants to do is have sex with women, because his dying wife's wish was he can get back out there again. Jason bumps into Shadia (Zoey Deutch) who's a photographer who used to be Jason's former photography class partner, **** meets Lenore (played by Audrey Plaza) who's a college student also slut who is obsessed with having sex with ol' grandpa.  And their gay best friend Bradley (Jeffery Bower-Chapman) whom **** seems to make fun of him because of his sexuality, are all heading to Daytona Beach, Florida, for spring break. DeNiro and Efron have good chemistry also DeNiro and Plaza have some funny decent chemistry as well, despite a crappy script by John M. Phillips also a crazy direction by director Dan Mazer, I laughed. 3 out of 5 stars"
2531,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,YorkMan,"Feb 3, 2016",6,"There's a lot of negativity surrounding this film and, while some is well deserved, quite a lot isn't. It's an 'exactly what it says on the tin' movie, so if you've seen the trailer and want to watch, you won't find anything beyond your own expectations.

De Niro plays 'dirty' grandpa next to Efron's preppy lawyer, soon to be married, thumb up his own arse, grandson. At the after funeral party of his wife, De Niro insists that Efron drive him down to Florida for what would be his Grandpa's annual trip there.
Cue sex gags, lots of women in bikinis, drug taking, beer chugging and more uses of the 'F' word by De Niro since Goodfellas (and probably a whole lot more actually).

The storyline itself isn't the main draw, it's the undeniable on-screen chemistry between De Niro and Efron, they look like they're both having fun playing against type, and it's De Niro's best comedy performance since Midnight Run.
Action/comedy are the watchwords, but there are some genuinely amusing 'out of the blue' moments that I wasn't expecting.
However, the rest of the film isn't brilliant. There are various stereotypical lesser characters: Efron's uptight, bossy fiance... The weird older brother... Indian(?) shop owner who sells narcotics... Bumbling muscly dudes from the Lacrosse team... Hot college girl who wants the 'sex trifecta' and actively goes after DeNiro....
Even the romance between Efron and his high school sweetheart is overly forced, as we all know exactly how it will end, even if the ride getting there is a fairly fun one....

Overall, it's not the abject disaster which everyone claims it to be. It's no 'Midnight Run' in terms of a De Niro comedy, but it's no 'Meet the ****' either (I so hate that film!!!)... It nicely sits in the middle, offering a decent slice of laughter, served with a sizeable portion of unoriginality."

Know that going in and you can have a fun time with Dirty Grandpa. The jokes are hit-and-miss, but the chemistry between the cast makes up for most of the fumbles."
2533,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,TVJerry,"Jan 29, 2016",4,"Robert De Niro has slummed before, but this is the nadir of his career. He takes his rigid grandson (Zac Efron) on a trip full of substance abuse, sexual encounters and other hopefully-shocking stuff. The script tries desperately to be raunchy and outrageous, but most of it’s not funny. De Niro cusses shamelessly and acts offensively, while Efron lacks any comic fun in his straight-laced reactions (although he flashes his buffness several times). The plot (learning to relax and follow his true self) follows the most trite path ever. To its credit, some of the supporting characters are fun and the pace never lags, but the movie’s effort to be excessive is just embarrassing. If you must see an octogenarian out of control, see Johnny Knoxville as BAD GRANDPA. It’s genuinely hilarious and even a little sweet."
2534,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,tvnewsguido,"Jan 25, 2016",6,"It's amusing and sometimes outright funny.

Efron and De Niro play off each other well (like a millennial odd couple) but the material doesn't really rise to either of the actor's performances. You'll see De Niro **** and a close up of his character's **** plus Efron's ass makes a couple of appearances if you're into that sort of thing.

It's not terrible but it's not consistently funny either. Skip this one in the theater. It'll be a fine Netflix time-waster one of these days."
2535,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,ydnar4,"Jan 24, 2016",6,"Dirty Grandpa gives you exactly what you would expect when you read the title. The film is raunchy as it gets. Robert De Niro is so funny as the most wild grandpa that anyone could ever have and he has surprisingly great chemistry with Zac Efron. Robert De Niro has been known to dip into comedy here and there but this is certainly as ""dirty"" as he has gotten and I would say that it is the funniest film I have seen him in a long time. Efron is also really good in this movie. I think that he's one of the more underrated actors in Hollywood right now. Sadly outside of the humor that I thought was fairly plentiful this movie does not have a whole lot more to offer. There are a few members of the supporting cast that are fairly good Aubrey Plaza could be as funny as I've ever seen her which is saying something. Zoey Deutch was great and I'm sure that her ""girl next door"" personality will get her roles in some more films soon. Dirty Grandpa is pretty predictable in the third act which brags it down and there are a few characters that take up a little too much of the screen time rather than focus on the character that we like. Its not a perfect movie but I can recommend it to people who love great laughs."
2536,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,TrilobiteG,"Jan 22, 2016",5,"Robert De Niro proves comedic talent, as well as a decent performance from Zac Effron. I think the greatest part of this movie was it's entire carpe diem motive, the fact that our protagonist has been conditioned for stationary demeaning work renders him as a blunt pencil, De Niro breathes some wanted life into him, and in himself (and possibly into Aubrey Plaza, but not in the metaphorical sense). However, a long string of jokes that deliver some truly funny hits, doesn't make up for the rushed exposition, probably one of the most rushed expositions I've ever seen from the movie. And when the jokes don't land, it's embarrassing for everyone, a ripple of awkwardness just hit's your soul, it's very unpleasant. Combine that with some unmoving and cliché story progressives and Dirty Grandpa is quite a disappointment. However, if it's a rainy sunday night, and you've got nothing else to do, Dirty Grandpa may be there to leave a humorous, old and raunchy hand at the ready."

The actors's performances, despite being all very renown actors was not as great as expected, in fact the emotions and jokes where pretty dull as well. It's just another ordinary average performance because of the script writing and movie directing style affected their roles. I would say a lousy writing and script is what leads to these great actors not performing  well. The was there but sadly it was a disaster as it was to serious in that aspect and sarcastic and hard to get sometimes. The sounds where great but the complete lack of music in certain scenes did not help the movie overall. It was a rushed plot-less movie which would have done a lot better if it where a TV short, because the plot was lacking a lot of content to the base. Overall this is a flawed movie down to the core and it is very disappointing even despite having some elements as entertainment and fun handled well. It is an average movie which could have been a lot better if not for lack of sheer content."

2542,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/just-getting-started/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,TheQuietGamer,"Jun 1, 2018",5,"A Christmas comedy for those of retirement age. As odd as it's holiday setting is, it does a decent job of showing those who are entering the final chapter of their lives having some fun. The plot centers around the rivalry between Morgan Freeman and Tommy Lee Jones and the former's mysterious past that eventually leads to them becoming friends. The humor is rather uneven and the pacing is quite slow. The whole thing is really just a series of competitions between the two leads broken up by awkward bits of unsuccessful flirting with Rene Russo's character before the more action-oriented (and absurd) final act.


The duo's battle for popularity and female attention is largely carried by Freeman. It's nice to see the actor being able to cut loose like this. Even in other movies like Last Vegas where the main idea is to watch everyone cut up, Freeman has always played one of the more restrained and mature characters onscreen. Here he's just a total playboy. Jones is decent as the straight man. His over-serious nature and constant grim stare make his one-liners more amusing than they otherwise would have been. A shame these two great and respectable leads weren't given better material.


For those just entering or already partaking in their later years, Just Getting Started will likely prove to be a good time. It's a middle-of-the-road comedy that wants to show that getting old doesn't necessarily mean that the good times are at an end. As the movie says, ""Happiness is not a condition. It's a choice."" Still, the choice might be somewhat out of people's hands when it comes to watching this one. Particularly in the case of more youthful viewers. The material is quite weak and no amount of pandering to a specific audience can cover it up. Plus there's how it comes off as more of a TV movie than something that made it's way into theaters. Overall, there is an audience for this film. Unfortunately I can't count myself among them, but maybe those who have gotten on up in the years can."

First, the various stories seem unrelated with only minor interactions. The transitions are abrupt, ending one story and then moving onto the next. While the plot ties them all together in the end, waiting for it takes some effort.

Second, all of the stories are centered around tragedy and I just stopped caring at some point.

Third, with the amount of time spent on the ""unreliable narrator"" device in the beginning, I expected (or even hoped for) it to play a significant role in the movie, but it doesn't. Sure, there is a little twist in the end that ties it all together, but it is ineffective and unimportant.

Finally, the resolution at the end that ties everything together was a disappointment."
2545,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/life-itself-2018/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Dufreshest,"Sep 27, 2018",6,"Life Itself tries to be tricky by playing around with death and a theme the film reveals concerning unreliable narrators. I think the film gets better with time. The film seems to be saying without love, there is nothing, though if one persists in their life, they will find everlasting love; Life Itself makes love the ever connecting fabric between the dead and the living.

I always like to remember as a part of the audience I am agreeing to view the content as-is in comparison to its full potential (which helps fulfill my critiquing) and if I want to view different forms of content then I should create or seek them. The film as-is is decent though leaves me as an audience member with the assignment of listening to Bob Dylan's return project to potentially fully grasp the essence of the film (if Bob Dylan really contributes to it as much as the film makes it seem). Life Itself is not meant to be a serious film (you have to experience the narrating for yourself) though deals with serious situations. 

The film shows that dialogue really affects actors and must be written well for effective scenes in film. Life Itself is showing life without expectations and relays life as uncontrollable in a great mysteriousness. I mean, yeah… death is our only guarantee (as far as I think anyone knows so far, that's all anyone knows of life that really isn't life, it's post life?).

Cinematically, the plot was cliched and offensive and the production aspects were boring, but the film had an excuse. This film was technically directed by David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle) in 2008, but he dropped his involvement in the film and much of it was reshot without him. This film made me laugh in many parts, however, and that is what this film is meant to be, a comedy. So do not watch this if you are looking for high-quality work like Russell's other films, but this is a lot of fun to watch."

I'm really sad watching it. Two of my favorite actors, Bruce Willis and Frank Grillo, are ruining their careers in both movies they played together. It's hard to understand why this duo has dropped to TV movie quality.

A bank is robbed. Bank manager Grillo. His neighbor is retired cop Willis. He is trying to find the man in these. That's the point. It's just comedy that American cops always stay on target and fall like a pear. No one can catch the man in the heart of the city.

It was in the pre-production for over a decade, before reshuffle and recasting happened with the existing one. It was supposed to be an Indo-Aussie joint production, but later the Belgium production company joined the project. After the several hurdles it managed to get completed. It was an Anglo-Indian historical romance-drama, during the British raj in India about betrayal, coup, revenge and a journey movie. Also simultaneously set in the modern world focusing an archaeological couple who discovers a lost ancient Indian jewel in a shipwreck. From there the story gets a perfect beginning, later moves back to India.

I don't understand what's with the Chinese music where the actual story take place in the 18th century India. It was so good and blends well, but that does define India or Indian culture while narrating its story. If you are not familiar with both Chinese and Indian musics, then it's not an issue at all. But that does not it, the names are Hindu and Indian soldiers with the Persian costumes, swords and other gadgets.

How the name 'Dragon's Throat' came to Indian geographical area and surname for the Indian characters in a wrong princely state. Like that, many stuffs make no sense, especially if you are from that part of the Earth. I think the research was very poor for making this movie. They should have hired an Indian musician and costume designer with an historian.

""Love has many faces,
and one of them is jealousy.""

The quality was top notch, the cast and their performances were excellent. But I could not stand for Bipasha Basu's facial expressions. She was always been in a sad face look, so depressing. That is the way her character was developed, so nothing wrong in her display. It was her international debut flick as well, and the launch was so disappointing. Because the story was very weak, maybe very silly. I have never seen the narration set in the ancient India other than in the Indian films. Quite amazing locations, and convinced with the visuals that how the 1700s' subcontinent would have looked like.

The major problem with this flick is that people can't get ending. How the time barrier was broken to pass through another timeline was never explained. The Hindu priest/saint/sadhu who blabbers about the space and time was a ridiculous than intellectual briefing. So this film owes lots of explanation to the viewers than entertaining them. I want to favour it, but I also want to be honest. The film was not like I was hoping for, very excited for the merge of historical subject with sci-fi, but did not stand tall. Thankfully, either it was not a bad movie of the year, I've seen even worse that I felt not to review. I won't recommend it, but there's a slim chance that you might like it, so choose it carefully.

This is why you're seeing reviews run hot and cold. The basic premise is a good, scifi-mind-transference one, but a short 100-min film demands unacceptable compromises. This needs A LOT of run room to properly play out, so it needed to be an 8 to 13 episode streaming series. Shoehorning this story into 100-mins results in ridiculous timelines and implausibilities. And Keanu's infamous wooden acting doesn't help to sell this either. Thank god for Middleditch's character that attempted to call into question so much of the ridiculosity going on. (Can't wait for the next season of him in Silicon Valley.) So look, you can be forgiven for hating this film, I struggled to get through it, but I wanted to understand the underlying story despite its hurried execution."

With iffy effects, mediocre acting from all involved (including Keanu Reeves unfortunately), unintentionally humorous scenes, and countless sci-fi tropes and cliches thrown into one jumbled mess of a film, it's definitely easily forgettable and disposable.

I really wonder how this was made for a whopping 30m budget and turned out so laughably mediocre especially with Keanu Reeves involved. It truly plays out like a VOD type 3m budget film with some awful acting, messy plotting, dull dialogue, and worst of all abhorrent mid 90s like CGI. While the intro abruptly intrigues somewhat with an ambitious enough sequence of events, it unravels into ridiculous yet watchable territory quickly. Most of the film drags on until an insane conclusion which at least swings for the fence with some exciting moments albeit nonsensical. Overall it's a very forgettable film that doesn't deliver much ultimately, that happens to have Keanu in it. If you're a fan of Keanu, it's worth watching but don't expect much."

This turns out to be super convenient as the scientist loses his wife and kids in a car crash. Grief-stricken, he clones their bodies and transfers their consciousnesses (as one does). What results is a surprisingly amateurish effort considering the lead.

The dialogue is pretty weak. People do things that don't feel natural. Weirdly enough, the movie explains certain things pretty thoroughly and interestingly, such as the whole lazarus/rebirth process, while other plot points are just revealed abruptly and sloppily.

The acting doesn't help things either. Keanu is on autopilot here. The guy who plays his boss is hit-and-miss. But it's Alice Eve (She's Out of my League; Star Trek into Darkness) who has the worst performance. She acts like an animatronic. (And yes this is even before the cloning. It isn't a something-went-wrong-type situation.) She has two facial expressions: slightly happy and slightly worried. On the plus side, Silicon Valley's Ben Middleditch is the only one who manages to make all the dialogue work. My hat off to him.

It's sad that this movie was botched so badly because the actual general story could have worked. The concepts they explore here are fun and fascinating. A lot of thought did go into how they brought the family back.

To it's credit, the film does look really good. It has excellent color use and picturesque filming locations.

Overall, this is a bad film, but I wouldn't say it was downright painful. I didn't leave regretting having watched it. If you like making fun of bad movies, then you might want to check this out. Otherwise, I can't recommend this."

The low-rent camerawork and costuming don't help. A lot of scenes looks like a bunch of Eurotrash rejects from The Matrix stepped into a student film. At one point the evil villain goes over his master plan. He literally just explains how retirement plans work, and then the Matrix rejects say ""please explain"". I think most 18-year-olds with a decent job can already follow the plot kid, but the director really thinks he sounds like a genius. It's like in a low-rent horror movie when a ""scientist"" tries to sound smart by reading a page from a gradeschool science book.

Director Jonas Akerlund is famous for his music videos which I've personally never thought were very well-made. They're usually just very weird, which works for music. But they weren't very technically well-shot. In a film, all his flaws are amplified.

It's sad because Mads Mikkelsen is amazing. Fans of his later performance in Hannibal already know how amazing Mads is as the sort of quiet intimidation that makes for a perfect assassin. He really acts the pants off his role, even while the Eurotrash around him stumble over lines and bad makeup and worse accents.

People will say ""just turn off your brain"". An enjoyable movie shouldn't have to involve absolutely insulting drivel. Here's a quick example. The bad guy needs exactly $29 million or whatever. So he decides to enact a giant plan to steal - wait for it - exactly $29 million. Except to do this, he's going to have to hire an absurd number of top-notch hitmen from around the world. That's going to cost, what, $29 million? So this job - at best - is going to break even? Come on. It isn't hard to write yourself out of this hole either - just make the payoff something absurd like a billion dollars. Why not?

Sigh. So this is a really stupid movie with annoying direction. Only watch it if you want to see Mads Mikkelsen kick some ass, and don't be afraid to fast forward the dumb Eurotrash nonsense between the action scenes. You won't miss anything."

You need to know what you are getting into here. It is style over logic, it is gore over typical holywood action politeness. It is John Wick on steroids, deformed action movie of highest degree.

Had a low expectation going in basically POLAR is a film that clearly wants to adpot the early 2000's graphic novel style a la Sin CIty, 300 but misses a beat as it is clear the filmmaker lacks the chops to pull it off. So we end up with a stale version of this which seems to have all the same ingredients but feels undercooked. It's a shame I feel like if the pacing had been tweaked and maybe a less flamboyant lead villan chosen the film could've hit closer to its target.

2571,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/polar/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,ViniciusBrito,"Feb 6, 2019",6,"A institution of professional killers have a policy of retirement at age 50. When the employee retires, they recieve millions of dollars, and for the company to keep their money and pay their bills they kill every single one that reaches 50 years old, The Black Kaizer is one of them and he will have to fight and shoot to survive. Directed by Jonas Âkerlund and written by Jayson Rothwell.
This film is a lot of fun, honestly, it doesn't delivery anything new at all, it is a very known kind of movie that doesn't change anything, but not every film needs to do that, right? The story in here is beyond simple, it is there just to justify the next actions, it is a concept better than anything, a nice and interesting one, not necessary makes sense, but if you don't think much about it, the notion will pull the rope into a fine place. The story is before anything else based on missions, during the film you see some missions that the hitman, Black Kaizer, did in his life and when he gonna reach 50 years old, his company will do anything to kill him, so after his last mission, we see him going under covered and a team trying to find him and kill him. While all of that the montage give us some flashes of something that at first it doesn't make any sense, you not sure if that is a flash foward or a flash back, they keep showing that all the time, you can realise that it is something that torments the character but not until the very end it does make sense, it give us a interesting plot twist, heavy and you can feel some tension, but the way how it was build up was ok, nothing very spetacular, but it is, again, a good twist. The narrative goes mostly in two ways, while showing the main character and stuff around him, it is more dark and raw, but when it changes to the team, it gets full cartoonized, with animation kill and crazy stuff, i like the idea, but how it was made i'm not so sure, there are some moments where they change to one and to another and the scenes in each one are so brief that feels wrong, all the time after some point it goes to crazy to dark, and when they do it, it should feel natural in both, but sometimes it does bother, but not all the time. This is that kind of film with hard sex, giant full of blood violence and drugs all the time, for those that enjoy this is for sure a full plate of fun. One problem with this film is the villain, the company boss, that kind of villain that is fat, have zero athleticism, is arrogant and thinks he is own control all the time, typical **** villain for this kind of film, i couldn't dislike this kind of character more, it is so boring and weak, i believe that they choose this kind of guy to be the villain because he is the completely opposite from what our main guy is, but it is so ridiculous, the character is in a top place in his work, and in every one of his scenes with Katheryn's character i was like, ""how is this dumb guy is still on top with she around?"" because he is so weak that i can't imagine how she would still be there, Katheryn's character would have knocked him out long time ago.
Mads Mikkelsen is really fun to watch, you can totally see that he put his time into his works and incorporate the character pretty fine and you believe in him, you can get angusty in his eyes, along with tranquility, wich makes sense, because he is already doing that for so long, even with all of that, it is possible to feel and see a traumatization by some of his old actions, it is a good interpretation of a not very original character. Katheryn Winnick doesn't have much to do in here, she kinda have some screen time, but what she gotta do is repetitive, in a lot of moments it seems that she is doing the same thing as her last scene, but still, she was ok, she didn't had much material to work with.
The action in this film is really good, it is brutal and combined with Mads acting just get better with time. We got a lot of gore scenes with penetrations and blood all the time. There are creativity in some moments and lack of it in others. There are a lot of moments where you can see that someone could have shot in him easily, but come on, right? There are a lot of badass moments for the character, there is one specifically in a cabin that it is really well done, combining the action with the speaking aspect and not being sure of where is who, it is relly raw and fun, there is one or another moment that doesn't made sense, but it was pretty good.
Polar is a very fun film, with hardcore sex, brutal and raw violence, and a concept that makes the story keep going, it isn't much original or different from other movies that are like this one, but it is definely a must watch for those who enjoy those aspects that i mention."

The villain Blut was more of a clown than a menace. And Vanessa's Camille was simply the product of bad writing.

However, I'm often left perplexed by Fred Durst's lyrics. Sometimes there's a clear message there and others all I can gather is that it's just a bunch word vomit where confusion seems to be the only rational reaction. You can probably guess which type The Fanatic more closely resembles...

In this clash between action movie star and obsessed fan it's never clear who you're supposed to be rooting for. ""Moose"" is a clearly autistic man who just doesn't know any better, but that doesn't make him any less dangerous. ""Hunter Dunbar"" is world-class jerk who definitely could handled the situation better, but it's hard to fault him for getting aggressive when faced with a stalker that crossed the line. Perhaps we're not supposed to sympathize with either of them in the end. Which would have been acceptable had there been some kind of meaning to all of this, but alas there doesn't appear to be any. So that violent conclusion just ends up leaving a bad taste in your mouth.

It's not even like The Fanatic really does all that much wrong. The humor it tries to mine from Moose's childlike behavior feels out of place and may not sit well with some as it comes at the expense of the mentally ill, but I wouldn't straight garbage or anything like that. It's just that without anything to say for itself the film's most notable qualities end up being John Travolta's all in, yet strangely terrible performance and the fact that it's entirely the brainchild of Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst. Both of which are certainly interesting, but not enough to make the movie worth watching given the considerable lack of substance.

(yes I also realise I just totally dated my own review with this dated gag reference, had to be done). So **** a dumb western filled with blatant stereotypes, corny routines, obvious gags and it treats women as nothing more than sexual objects, but in all honesty what did you expect? Firstly its an Adam Sandler movie, and secondly, it has 'ridiculous' in the bloody title! its literately saying to you, this movie is gonna be daft as ****, you have been warned. So why all the fuss I don't know.

Plot wise its your typical western fare about revenge ****, more revenge. Tommy Stockburn (Sandler) has been raised by native Americans (or red Indians to be politically incorrect) because way back as a child his mother was shot dead by a mysterious stranger. His father Frank (Nick Nolte) was an infamous bank robber and just happens to come by Tommy's village to tell him he's his father because plot convenience. Frank speaks of 50K he's buried away and intends to share with Tommy, but before you can say rootin-tootin outlaws, some outlaws turn up that used to be in a gang with Frank and claim the money. Frank lies about the moneys whereabouts as the gang take him hostage to go find it, this gives Tommy time to find the loot in its real location. Alas Tommy is unable to find the loot so he must come up with another way to raise 50K to pay the outlaws and save his dad. The clock is ticking before the outlaws realise that Frank was lying about the moneys location.

Now the main lure here must be the stereotypical ridiculous six characters that are all hilariously related to each other, no really its **** its not. Sandler is obviously the leader of the gang, the low gravely Eastwood voiced, ice cool loner, raised by native Americans and is super hot with knives. Terry Crews is Chico, a black piano player who hasn't ever admitted to anyone he's actually, possibly, slightly black, and of course despite the fact he's ****'s actually a real softie. Jorge Garcia plays Herm, a role that probably would have gone to John Belushi or John Candy if they were alive. A big fat slobby, dirty, feral type bloke who can't speak English but everyone understands him anyway. Taylor Lautner embarrasses himself immensely here as the gangs redneck simpleton complete with braces and buckteeth. Luke Wilson plays the dandy type, good looking, athletic, well dressed, but a miserable failure with his last occupation as a bodyguard for Abe Lincoln. Lastly good old Rob Schneider plays the greasy dirty Mexican Ramon who owns a donkey with super powered diarrhea. So there you have a complete array of stereotypes, the white man raised by Indians, the token black guy, the fat slob, the doofus, the dandy and the dirty Mexican. Oh and Nolte, can't understand a bloody word he's saying, not one.

Now whilst many might be expecting the biggest load of horse **** this side of the Rio Grande, in all fairness, its not that **** places. The gang sets out to pinch 50K from various people and places that they consider to be bad or immoral, so they don't feel bad about stealing basically. As you might expect what you get is pretty predictable stuff with some pretty daft action. They rob a bank utilising Ramon's diarrhea filled donkey as a diversion, yes this means the donkey **** all over someone. They steal a huge gold nugget from a casino owned by Smiley Harris (Harvey Keitel), this involved much silly hijinks from the whole gang such as Chico and his piano playing and Tommy with his knife skills. They also steal a huge sum of cash from Ezekiel Grant (Jon Lovitz), Mark Twain (Vanilla Ice) and General Custer (David Spade) in a poker game which involves the whole gang. Yes I did just mention Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain, yes it was unbelievably insane casting, yes I admit I quite liked it yet I do not know why, yes I am ashamed of myself.

Another rather quirky scene involved John Turturro as Abner Doubleday, the man who apparently came up with the all American national past time of rounde...errr baseball. I don't know the history behind this actual person, nor do I know the rules of baseball inside out, however I do have a basic knowledge of the game, not that that's necessary to enjoy this scene though...I digress. Anywho, this scene is actually quite amusing as Turturro literately makes up the rules of baseball as he goes along, but only because he's trying to not lose at his own creation. It sounds childish but the fact that Doubleday is useless at his own sport creation, whilst everyone else is getting the hang of it, was actually reasonably funny, mainly because of Turturro's performance.

This movie is pretty much like any throwaway silly comedy I've ever seen through my life, it has its moments, it does make you smile at times, and to that **** done its job essentially (much like the gloriously stu"

This artsy, European and Asian cinema influenced personal story is a very small low budget film of slight accomplishment. That doesn't make it less worthy though.  What does is the fact it is a far lesser effort than so many others and has no particular brilliance.  Just because a story is personal does not qualify it for production nor a wide audience.  Everyone has a story, and most are not cinematic enough to be told.  Sorry.  Yet still, there is nothing wrong with telling a little story from your life.  It's good the film was made and has its merits for some.  What is wrong is the sick deranged mass over praise by shallow crying to be noble critics for a very slow, arty for art's sake, little film that doesn't deliver on story craft or emotion to any degree remotely close to a great personal film with similar subject matter of growing up in a rough city setting like ""Boyz n the Hood"".

Or, at least interested and invested in their story and where it's **** concept is not my favorite, but it holds water as far as a plot goes. However just as you are wrapping up at 2:00, and wondering where this plane is going to land, the film takes a wild unexpected turn for the worst.

They tend to be unpleasant and have an obsession with being locked away both physically and emotionally from the outside world. This movie is probably the one I’ve liked the least on first viewing. I didn’t feel like any character was particularly clever and no one had any redeeming qualities. In the end I just didn’t care what happened to anyone in the movie.

The movie is 2 hours and 13 minutes of which 13 minutes could have been cut very easily or spent in explaining some relationships that are sort of glossed over.

""Parasite"" takes place in Korea and the differences between the classes are made immediately. The film has subtitles that took me a few minutes to get used to but to which I adapted fairly quickly.

I left the theatre glad I didn't walk out but at the same time I really can't see recommending it while, on the other hand, Allen thought it was a classic whodunit."

I saw a few movies made by him, a drama ""Mother"" and a SciFi ""Snowpiercer"" and I liked both of them.
This latest movie ""Parasite"" won the most prestigious prize at Cannes festival, Palme d'Or this year. My expectations were mixed: on one hand, both critics and audience *loved* the movie.
On the other hand, it's a black comedy: not my thing.
So I went to see it.
What can I say? Maybe I am missing something here.
I found it not funny at all.
Performances were poor.
The script - ridiculous.
The movie is long: more than two hours. I felt an urge to leave after one hour but I fought it. After an hour and a half I finally left, I could not stand it any longer.
I feel like I am not supposed to rate it since I haven't seen it in its entirety but if I had to, it would be 3 out of 10.
Once again, I am probably missing something here since it is not my genre.
If you usually like black comedies, you may enjoy it as so many people do."

Like watching the neighbor through the window in their daily routines. Slow-paced scenes to eliminate cinematic rhythm. Black and white for a flattening of colors, removing distractions from the slow flow of things. The plot flat and ordinary. Could we call it a contemplative film?
I think the questions to ask us are:
- Is it necessary to pay a ticket to observe someone else's life, like on a social network?
- Does the time spent yield anything in return?
I might understand the concept, but for my taste, entirely unnecessary, leaving the feeling, minute by minute, of a constant loss of time.
After one hour and thirty watched, we drop the movie. Could it had a brillant ending? Maybe, but i suspect it don't worth all that time."

Plenty of scenes that are fillers and don't particularly go anywhere.

It is like watching the life of a regular person, with ups and downs, and nothing more. The ending is abrupt, showing that there is really no real message, nothing concrete. It is a mash-up of things that can happen to anyone's life but what can be attractive to some is that it is not what many people might have lived in their lives. It is like a person that wants to go to a ""poor country to appreciate life more"" kind of thing.

In many ways, it reminded me of films from the 1950s and 1960s from European directors, mainly Italian, such as ""Bitter Rice"", ""The Bicycle Thief"", ""Open City"", Michelangelo Antonioni, Robert Rossellini and Victoria De Sica. The main differences are that these films and directors didn't take 2+ hours to tell their stories or linger too long even by a second on a scene whether it be a boy looking out a car window or a dog jumping up against a gate. They brought new cinematography to the screen and more depth to their stories.

Maybe it has been a long time since critics/people have seen such films that reflect life between the classes or maybe ""Downton Abbey"" has given them a false picture of the same. There are little passions or emotions shown by the director/screenwriter Alfonso Cuaron.

The surprising aspect of ""Roma"" is the acting debut of Yalitza Aparicio as a maid who has a warm connection to the children of her employers and though she is a presence throughout the film it only comes alive when it concentrates on her trials and tribulations.

No soy para nada un experto en cine, ni mucho menos. Ni tampoco soy amante de Derbez u Omar Chaparro, como muchos de los simpatizantes de Cuarón gustan etiquetar a los que no piensan igual que ellos.
Hablando objetivamente, la película tiene una fotografía increíble, como todas las películas de Cuarón (obviamente este es su fuerte, no la trama. Como ejemplo, tenemos Gravity).
Yalitza como Cleo hizo un buen trabajo considerando que no es una actriz.
Pero de ahí en mas creo que intenta demasiado ser una película ""inteligente"" de ""arte"" con su filtro en blanco y negro que no agrega nada. En fin.

One thing good about this movie tho; the photography, really beautiful shot.
Now.... The actual history behind the movie is predictable, boring and poorly written. I never got to connect with any character, thanks to a very lack of emotions from them they are just cast into a one dimensional role, and they never get out of it. If he tried to portrait the maid as they are in Mexico (I mean very submissive and so desperate that they accept any circumstances) then all the other characters should have a large array of emotions so there's contrast. But there's just no contrast they're all superficial stereotype persons.
A lot of scenes could  have also been removed and we could have ended up with a much shorter and less tedious movie instead we have a very long, predictable with a lot of useless scenes movie, might it repeat again there are some beautiful shots tho. I hope it doesn't get the Oscar because there are just so many better narrated and well shot movies out there.

It is obviously copying Zerkalo (The Mirror) by Tarkovsky but with far less ingenuity, creativity and poetry. Whereas Tarkovsky makes his life and his memories interesting by cleverly destroying time and space, blurring the lines between reality and dream, and making us think, think, think about our own memories, Cuaron serves a linear, egotistical, boring diaporama of his own life that didn't touch me at all. All this of course with a heavy dose of sentimentality and ""humanism"" that can't go wrong with middle-class critics.
But what about the cinematography?
The initial slow constant circular movement of the camera is obviously designed to clash with the perpetual zig-zagging of the little bee worker, create this extra tension and the rest is just like that. The scene of the fire is completely in line with his work in ""children of men"" with camera shifting from different points of foci in the same frame. All this is probably well crafted, and different from Hollywood, but doesn't inspire any beauty or even elicit any form of intellectual reflection.

Unfortunately, those are about the only redeeming qualities this release has to offer. The rest is a big, bloated, underdeveloped bore that tries the patience of even the most tolerant cinephile. It's obvious this was a heartfelt project for director Alfonso Cuaron, and his personal passion is written all over it. But, given that he's dealing with uninteresting characters in largely unexplained circumstances in a time frame for which little to no context or back story is provided, he's not giving the audience much to work with other than a glib implication that essentially says ""This is authentic -- just trust me on this."" Also, the picture's anemic attempts at incorporating philosophical and metaphysical themes show the filmmaker's got some brushing up to do in terms of effectively conveying his meaning in a comprehensible way.

If anything about good and evil, right or wrong, morality in general is touched upon, it is strictly restrained to moral relativism, where it's always ""up to the viewer"" to form their own feelings, the filmmaker tries not to offer the slightest clue about his or her stance on the issues. Pretty much every last ""critically acclaimed"" TV show these days falls under this category, and a plethora of movies, Manchester by the Sea being the most recent example of the ones I have seen, though it's really not about one or two examples.

The issue I have with this ""non judgmental"" trend is that I firmly believe art, truly great art, should in some shape or form benefit society, not simply present it ""as is."" When society celebrates stories of moral relativism, it adopts moral relativism. Things that were, and for good reason, seen as clearly wrong, suddenly become ""complex,"" up for personal interpretation, depending on ""circumstance."" And if challenged, the excuse is always ""oh I'm not endorsing this, I'm just portraying real life without judging. This is what people do.""

But when art abandons teaching moral messages, that contributes to society becoming morally anchorless and losing its scope of what's right or wrong. No, this definitely is not an argument about ""violent movies influence violence in real life"" or anything of the sort - it's not about what is portrayed, but how it is portrayed. And morality seems to have been sacrificed by many filmmakers on the altar of realism, with both public and critical acclaim embracing this with both arms."

I see that many have expressed dislike of the film but have nonetheless praised Affleck's acting.  Can't agree.  I myself don't think the film is Oscar-worthy.  Frankly, it bored me.  Affleck's acting struck me as one-dimensional; he seemed removed.  And the fact that he didn't have an accent was a complete turn-off.  After all, Casey's a Massachusetts native & his character was raised in Manchester.  The fact that his character lacked a regional accent seriously detracted form this film's realism.  (In a very funny recent SNL skit he played a Dunkin' Donuts fanatic from Boston & his accent was Just So.)  I thought Michelle Williams was good in her role, but the real standout in this film was Lucas Hedges. I liked the ending."

I prefer slices of cake.""  This is a prime example of why he expressed that sentiment and why he was the Master, and why so many are students of his to this day.  The filmmakers of this little indie slice of life film are not.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it is naive not to realize the tenants of suspense apply to all stories and genres, that any good movie needs some form of imagination.
The writer/director here is trying to pass off a lazy, half baked, self indulgent, contrived excuse for a movie that is very slow, dreadfully boring, poorly edited (in the sense of economy of running time), and unevenly acted (at times it's naturalistic and real, while at others it's painfully forced and phony, with Casey Affleck delivering a suitably competent performance but certainly not outstanding by any sane measure)... and the critics just ate it up!  They swallowed the pretentious void of story craft and lack of dynamics hook, line and sinker, as the herd on the scent of pretentious art films does, so often mistaking the pretense of art for actual accomplished audience pleasing work, or even difficult opaque but still highly worthy endeavors that require work on the audience's part.  This thing is neither.  Moviemakers should always work for the audience, not the other way around.  That means even with difficult, challenging or disturbing material the work of story craft in a narrative must be done before it's given to the audience.  To just throw up on screen some ramblings and musings (no matter how tragic or melancholic) that a screenwriter jacked off on the page and called it a day is no excuse for the lack of quality entertainment or ""art"" in any genuine sense of the word when it comes to the cinema.

Of course The Academy flock will also delight full course on this unpalatable slice of s--- too.  Meanwhile we, those in and who work for the audience, shake our heads in disgust at the obscene deranged over-praise."

I'm surprised it received a nomination for best screenplay because too often there is no meaningful dialogue between characters or very little.  Music now plays where words used to be.  Can't any one write any more.  And because of this lack of dialogue, Casey Affleck has little to work with outside of being depressed due to the deaths in the film.  This film also has a lot of foul language, too many slow scenes and unnecessary scenes that I wished I could have fast forwarded through or that the director would have cut.  The plot is good, but not ever film needs to be edited with meaningless flash backs.  I understand why the director edited it like that, but some scenes were unnecessary.  Can't writers and directors tell a story in chronological order any more?  At least, sometimes.  ""Manchester By The Sea"" isn't a bad story.  It's just a film that you should wait to see on DVD, so that you can fast forward through the slow scenes and mute the offense language if necessary."

My concern has grown since going to watch it. I'm glad the masses found it enjoyable. I, unfortunately, find myself to be one of few (at least vocal) cinemagoers who did not like the film. Leaving the cinema, I was offended. I felt gypped, cheated, mislead, though, happy to see the back of it. To evoke the saying ""throw me a bone"", this movie showed me its bones, one by one, placed them clumsily into its various pockets and tripped into the sea. I waited for this movie to give me anything, something I could leave with, something to shock me, something I haven't seen before. It gave me the latter, perhaps the most tedious, plodding, most unenjoyable cinema experience in recent memory.  I found myself counting the seconds between each line of dialogue delivered. It was comical. I was grasping for threads to follow, themes of substance, anything, I was starving. Maybe that was the point, a realist approach, showing it as it were, I had surmised. I tossed and turned in this manner until I had no longer cared as to construe purpose in the film. Resorting to taking in the pretty pictures, I landed at the conclusion that this was what the film was, and just that. Just as I relaxed uncomfortably, a thought of Barry Lyndon came to my head. Perhaps this film excels at nothing.

As I do with any art related enterprise, I give props to the filmmakers for making art, participating in the craft, and for throwing in their two cents. Offended as I was by the lack of substance within the picture, they provided me with something to get passionate about, even if that may be the distaste for the picture itself. I see this picture called ""The perfect film"", to that I must conclude this is your first time, there's much more in store for you."

And I simply couldn't believe that any mother would react so lightly to learning that her husband intended to petition for full child custody.

What did she see in Blanchett's character that was so appealing? What did Blanchett see in her? Until their later scene of passion, I just never felt any chemistry between them.

The two characters had no chemistry, and even in their best moments, they lacked any joy and excitement.

Christopher Nolan wanted a suspense film, and not a war film as such, and yet this is a failure too, as I had no empathy with any of the characters weather they lived or died. Hans Zimmer is a great music composer, however the music  was supposed to add some intensity and suspense to the film and yet I just found it annoying as it was constant throughout.

Very surprising how metacritic users give this film such high praise.

Dunkirk is essentially Nolan's excuse to make another one of his thriller, the WW2 setting is just accessory. As a thriller, it delivers. Coupled with the stressful (but repetitive, one of his weakest) score from Hans Zimmer, the film always keeps the viewer under suspense.

However, in all other regards, the film is an abject failure. As a historical WW2 film, it fails because it is not realistic. Every shot is obviously filmed in stylistic ways to deliver suspense, but not realism. It is opera, almost. You do not see the Germans (even less than in a Spielberg film), you do not see real combat. You see bullets coming from nowhere and killing people. You see and hear bombs falling. But you dont see the enemy.

On a historical realism level, it is also completely out of place. Dunkirk is a ghost city, not a city full of scared French civilians. Again, the German Army (at least Recon troops) is nowhere to be seen. I did not even feel the scale of such a magnificient evacuation. I did not feel like 300,000+ people were just evacuated from that city. I felt like a couple line of people on board some destroyers, were saved. Not to mention the film itself is chock full of historical myths and inaccuracies, which I would have expected such a great director as Nolan to not make. The biggest myth being that the 300,000+ people were saved by the ""small boats"", when in fact most of them (at least 1/3rd French, which you also do not see in the film) were evacuated on board large ships (as historical footage on youtube shows). To summarize, the entire film takes the script from the most ridiculous British ego-stoking mythical writing of this battle. ""300,000 men on that beach, thousands of little boats, in an élan of British National pride, came to save the soldiers, etc"". Instead of what should have been a gritty battle in the streets, mass of people on destroyers, etc.

Finally, my biggest gripe, above and beyond the repetitiveness of the film and historical inaccuracy, is the laughable PG rating. The rating turns whats supposed to be a gut-wrenching war film, where I expect flak-decapitated soldiers, Stuka bombs disembowelling people, dead bodies rotting on the beach, etc...Into a completely colourless film. The entire film is strangely grey and dark, and when a bomb falls or shot is fired, bodies fly in the air (completely intact) without even a drop of blood on their face.

All in all, this film is a pretty thriller, not the realistic war film I expected Master Nolan to produce. And its a shame because the Battle of France (and generally the Western Front before the Americans came into the war late in 1944), is a very unexplored setting that merits much better.

Nolan, you disappoint me."

Is it just because it's Christopher Nolan? Because that's the only reason I went and saw it, and I was unimpressed. The plot was simultaneously boring and confusing and none of the characters had any depth. Most of them didn't even have names. I honestly don't know why I was supposed to care about anything that was happening onscreen. Like, I didn't enjoy watching people die - I'm not a monster. But it's hard to understand why this story was told. It was just a story of how sad war is, and even then, it didn't even do a great job of telling that.

This movie was beautiful to watch, especially in IMAX.  The first 10 minutes or so was pretty good. After that, no real substance. No character development. Virtually no dialogue. It was so difficult to really care about any of the characters. Tom Hardy's character was pretty good, but still no depth. The timeline is a bit odd, but I didn't feel that it added anything to the movie. Nothing like Memento, my favorite Nolan movie.   The movie seemed so much longer than than the 107 minutes that it was. Pacing was awful. I have no idea how it gets so many 100 scores."
2814,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dunkirk/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,Garr,"Aug 3, 2017",2,"Dunkirk, more like Dung-Crap! This movie looked and sounded great in I-Max. That's the end of the good. Now to the bad. This movie had no characters. I felt zero emotional connection to anyone in this movie. I didn't care if anyone lived or died. Mark Rylance's character was the only one who was halfway interesting. He was the only character who had a decent amount of dialogue in the film, who had a clear goal, and who made decisions. The other character that had more than 5 lines in the picture was Kenneth Branagh's. He was utterly pointless. It seemed like he was watching the movie, and his purpose was just to say a cheesy lines about ""Home"" every once in a while. Tom Hardy's character was boring, repetitive, and predictable. This movie is so messed up, it is really hard to decide who the main character is, but if I had to decide, it'd be the guy we see 1st. He is very forgettable. He looks and acts almost identical to almost everyone in the whole movie. He meets a friend while he is taking a dump. No joke. He stops and helps his new friend bury a body. And he doesn't poop the whole movie. Him and his new friend just try to escape the whole movie. That leads me to my second point: there is no plot. It's just a bunch of explosions. There's more plot in a Transformers movie. 'Poop guy' and 'bury dead body guy' just go from ship to ship trying to live. By the way, the movie is almost over before 'bury dead body guy' says anything. So these guys try to live, Kenneth Branagh stands on a dock and says things that don't matter, Mark Rylance picks up survivors in his boat, and Tom Hardy shoots other planes, while in his plane, over and over and over again, while not being seen or heard. And that's your movie. I kept waiting for the opening action sequence to be over. I kept waiting for it to slow down a little and have some exposition, but it never did. It was like I missed the beginning and just tuned into the climax of a long, humorless, silent picture. That's not to say that a movie can't be action packed and be great. U-571 is an example of a nearly non-stop, action packed, WWII movie, thrill ride. U-571 managed to have memorable and distinct characters with different purposes. U-571 had a plot with a clear goal and twists and turns. If Dunkirk could've just cut out some of the unnecessary bits, like Kenneth Branagh, and had the 1st half hour be set up and character development, then it could've been really good. But as it was, I didn't care about any of it. I kept watching English soldiers die and thinking, ""I don't care. This movie didn't make me care."" As simple as the plot for Dunkirk was, the movie was really confusing. You'd think if you're going for an exciting, action thriller, that a simple linear plot would suffice. This movie jumps all over the timeline without giving any hint that it just made a jump in time. Christopher Nolan does a great job of jumping all over the timeline in his movie Memento. In Memento, he manages to keep things coherent and engaging. Not so here. This is just disappointing. The time jumping is completely unnecessary here. What little dialogue there is in this film is really hard to hear because of thick accents, loud explosions, masks over faces, and the music being really loud in the mix. With a really simple plot that is really hard to follow and characters with zero development or even distinguishing traits, I found myself in a really big struggle to care about what I was watching, even with incredible imagery and sound design. Yet, the whole time, the movie was telling me what I was watching was really exciting with it's music score. And that leads me to my last point: I hated the music. It pains me to say that because I usually love Hans Zimmer, especially under the direction of Christopher Nolan. There is virtually no melody in this score. It's relentless and annoying. I guess I can't blame Zimmer, considering he was just scoring to picture. Imagine watching The Dark Knight, but during the entire movie all you heard was The Joker's theme, non-stop. That's what it's like. The whole soundtrack may as well just be an air raid siren. And it's not just the music. The sound effects, as incredible as they were, were also loud, annoying, and relentless. At times, I found myself covering my ears. I thought, ""Why am I paying money to cover my ears? What I'm covering my ears to is what I paid for."" You know what movie is better than this: all the movies I have seen this year. Valerian and The Mummy were even better. They were at least fun. The best movie I've seen this Summer is War for the Planet of the Apes, but you really need to see all the Apes pictures to get the full enjoyment out of that one. The next best is Spider-Man: Homecoming, but maybe you're not up to date with the Marvel movies. In that case, see Wonder Woman. You don't need to see the other DC movies to enjoy that one. But what ever you do, don't see Dunkirk. I beg of you not to give that garbage your support."

There is nothing wrong with Charlotte Rampling's performance but certainly not worth an Oscar nomination over either Lily Tomlin in ""Grandma"" or Charlize Theron in ""Mad Max"" just to name possible other candidates. Do I say that the film is 'much ado about nothing' and would have been served better being a one hour TV movie on Lifetime or Netflex?

""45 Years"" seems just that long in spite of the running time being only 95 minutes but it is padded with many scenes of Rampling, sometimes with a dog, sometimes not, walking on the admitted beautiful shots of Norfolk landscapes where the story takes place or one extended scene of her playing the piano.

The conflict, that took place before they met, seemingly upends all that they have had is really a flimsy reason for what takes place. She was a teacher, he a factory manager and they have had a 45 year loving, comfortable, childless marriage with both being retired now, she still very active and he slowing down to illness.Without giving anything away it seems very far fetched that things always available are now seen and read for the first time.

Watching the performances of Charlotte Rampling and Tim Courtenay, who have been stars for over 50 years, are always a joy to watch and even though their silences can say a lot here they really aren't given substantial material to work with.  There is a scene between the two having sex that is very funny and could be real to life but it isn't enough.

I guess that's artsy, but if you ask me, it's lazy storytelling, the issues were not explored so it's not surprising they were not resolved.  Was the acting fantastic?  Yes sir, but if you put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig.  Anyone who enjoyed this movie must have a lot of time on their hands and little to do with it (just like the two lead characters)"

It has no social importance or, more seriously, redemption. It is a movie about white men killing white men. There are no women, no blacks, no other ethnicities but Italians (even the “Irishman” is played by an Italian). Movies like this have littered the film landscape for 38 years since 1972’s The Godfather (which did the same thing but so much better, mainly because the genre was new). On a broader brush I say: Scorsese and Tarantino and the ilk should no longer have the power to make their pointless glorification of murder stories. It is long past time to let new voices with new visions into the boys club of directing and producing movies. I am a movie lover fed up with decades of stories about murderers. Make it stop.

Harvey Keitel and Katherine Narducci were two bright spots but barely registered in the story.  The editing was very poor and couldn’t save what was a weak script to begin with.

On l'a compris, c'est un film de **** jeunes ici... qu'il a fallu rajeunir vraiment par ordinateur, l'histoire se déroulant sur quelques décennies.

La réalisation reste naturellement très soignée et souvent élégante, la voix off est bel et bien là mais l'humour féroce des Affranchis ou de Casino a quasiment disparu, dilué dans les 3h30 de ce long gala d'anciens combattants qui n'en finit pas...

A dormir debout, mou et dépassé, The Irishman n'est qu'une ombre très pâle et pauvrette des gloires du temps d'avant mais la nostalgie n'est plus de saison, camarade, même si Netflix met la main à la poche, balançant le fric par les fenêtres... en vain."

2863,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-irishman/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,sweens112,"Nov 26, 2019",1,"A huge (and lengthy) swing and a miss from Scorsese, De Niro, and Netflix. The plot was meandering and directionless, the writing stale and regurgitated. There were several scenes involving dialogue between two characters in which they argued about minor inconsequential details, repeating those details back to one another through numerous camera changes, and the viewer is left wondering, ""Did I just sit through 30 seconds of another meaningless conversation about whether the mob ‘really means it this time'""? I would need to watch those scenes again to be sure (I won't) but it didn't seem like those scenes had any higher purpose other than showcasing the editor's boredom with the subject matter (or maybe Netflix's budgetary desire to limit the best directors and actors of our generation to one take).

Aside from complaints about De Niro's believability as Irish, his acting was wooden. Pacino occasionally shone as Jimmy Hoffa despite some difficult dialogue, Joe Pesci was solid in an understated performance, and Stephen Graham turned in a typically excellent, nuanced portrayal of simmering anger beneath an outwardly gregarious exterior. There are a couple superior moments, one involving a vodka-spiked watermelon, and another with some great dialogue between Louis Cancelmi and the perpetually confused Jesse Plemons regarding the provenance of a nonexistent fish. Ray Romano was largely forgettable—although that may have been the point—but appearances by Anna Paquin, Harvey Keitel, and Bobby Canivale were entirely wasted. At three hours and thirty minutes long, I kept hoping there was enough time for a clear throughline to emerge, but as the movie shifted in the last half hour to bludgeoning the viewer over the head with scenes of a man contemplating his death and haggling over caskets, I realized that like De Niro's Irishman, there would be no redemption for this movie. Instead, it is simply Scorsese's meandering, aimless final run with some of his mobster-portraying pals.

Unfortunately The Irishman is not even close to being in the same league as his other work. If you'll excuse me, I need to go watch Goodfellas, Gangs of New York, and The Departed on repeat for the next several days to erase the memory of this dud. It'll be a much better use of my (and anyone else's) time."

2865,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-irishman/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,Format916,"Nov 21, 2019",3,"The Irishman, the highly anticipated film from Martin Scorsese which reunites actors Joe Pesci. Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino for the first time in decades, in this adaptation of the book I Heard You Paint Houses which recounts the final days of Jimmy Hoffas life and the connection Frank The Irishman Sheeran had to Hoffas disappearance.

There are at least two moments in the film where Robert Deniro's charcter Frank Sheeran mentions how young people of today dont know much about Jimmy Hoffa other than the fact that he dissapeared. And I am definitely in that category and that is how I will be approaching this review. The name Jimmy Hoffa was etched into popular culture as being a notable figure who went missing. I have not done any research on the topic, nor watched or remember previous films on the subject of Jimmy Hoffa, so this story was able to shed some light on Hoffa, who was the head of the Teamsters, and how he was basically the most important figure of the American worker next to the President. The story is told through 3 different timelines. The film begins with an elderly Sheeran telling the audience his story, which then shifts to the present with DeNiro and Pesci on a road trip to Detroit. During their roadtrip, Sheeran recollects the first time he met Bufalino and then shifts to the past to when he began his life of crime. Like other gangster films of the past there are many players and characters to come and go as the film progresses. These films are telling stories that span decades, so even if the viewer is confused or not really know what is going on, you can view it and compare it to gangster films of the past.

And in that regard. I feel The Irishman just cant compare to other films that were told better: Goodfellas, Casino, The Godfather.  Alot of the times while watching this I felt I had already seen it before. Which is how some people feel about Casino being another version of Goodfellas. And I guess I was expecting something as epic as those films, but nothing ever comes close. My opinion may be unpopular,  but wait for Netflix. And hearing the hefty pricetag on this film x I just couldn't see it on the screen. It really didnt feel cinematic at all. When I went home I had to do a double feature of Goodfellas and Casino just to remind myself that Gangster movies can be a plethora of things: exciting funny and sad. The Irishman is mostly a slog and in time wont be remembered like other classics."

The movie seemed to have lost sight (or never had it) of what was the main story or character, and I felt myself struggling to figure that out every step of the way.  There are long movies and then there are unnecessarily long movies; this was the latter.  The last hour, especially, was inexcusably so.  Pesci was understated and magnificent, while DeNiro and Pacino seemed miscast and cartoonish.  Scorcese felt he had to tell *everything* about the mafia and the teamsters union over decades, and I mean absolutely everything: every event, every character, it was ridiculous.  I know some of the critics have applauded the slow pace, the artistry of the photography, but I just don't get that.  How about story?  How about understanding relationships and what motivates a character?  This was Goodfellas, with lots of time added in and lots of fun taken out."

Now this may work for kids who can't understand such things but adults should be slamming this. Just a big disappointment."

It's frighteningly dull. Just another road movie, this time set inside a frame story that just failed to reach me. The emotion characters are somewhere in-between worshiping and controlling a little girl who gets upset because.... her new house is dirty. A big victorian house in the most expensive city in the country. The whole movie I felt more empathy for the parents who tried to make the move comfortable for their daughter.
The whole emotions/memories world just failed to wow me. It seemed inconsistent, cheesy and reductive. Even when the worst happened and whole buildings crumbled, they just reappeared intact later on. The jokes were bland... the whole movie was."

I was really looking forward to this because all the critics loved this movie, but I have no idea why they liked this boring boring movie. A stupid adventure of fictional people inside a girl's head repesenting each emotion. They go on a made-up adventure that has nothing to do with reality.

I have been a Pixar fan for years, even since my dad bought me Toy Story on VHS and me, him and my step-mother watched it in the living room on our projector. They had a good cast (minus Lewis Black. That guy just grates me), just to me it falls apart at it's story line and it's execution.

Where it falls apart for me is the characters and the lack of development they have. You just don't feel anything towards them, so you don't care for or feel any of the emotions that they are feeling. This disappointed me as with their previous film ""Up"", and they managed feel every range of emotion possible in the space of the first 10 minutes.

The other big problem I had with Inside Out was that the world that populate the feature with-in Riley's ""psyche"" were boring, bland, lifeless and unimaginative. When the 2 main characters are having navigate themselves through them, they just leave nothing memorable. To me, the worlds are literally dead and lifeless.

I have 2 positives, though they do not compare the 2 negatives I have already listed. The animation (unsurprisingly) is stunning and is the exact level you expect a Pixar animation to be at. Now to the most enjoyable part of the film in my opinion. The story revolves around the emotions residing inside of Riley's head and essentially revolves around her. The most enjoyable part of the film for me was where we showed the emotions inside the mother and fathers heads, and also during the credits scene you see inside quite a few other characters heads. It is pretty funny as well as very inventive. Shame that it is barely 5 minutes of the entire film.

I can see kids enjoying the film, but being a long standing Pixar film fan, I did not enjoy it in the slightest. I hope they do better on their next project."

Filmed on location in Italy, this is a wonderful travelogue and visual description of the beautiful town in which all of the scenes take place and the outstanding cinemaphotography must be acknowledged. Unfortunately, that is where the depth and beauty of the picture ends. There is basically no story save the love the two lead characters find with each other and taking 2 hours and 12 minutes is too long a period of time to tell it.

I’ve read nothing but raves about the film when in film festivals and it has been nominated for the Golden Globe and sure to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Film.

The acting, as reported, is very good with a few minor quibbles but that mainly has to do with the story, the scenery in Northern Italy is at times breathtaking and at other times quiet, serene while the musical soundtrack at times can be jarring here and there.

While there is good chemistry between Armie Hammer, playing 24-year-old Oliver, and Timothee Chalamet as 17-year-old Elio the much-needed passion that is written and hinted about isn’t there in the writing. The former has been hired as a summer intern to the latter’s father, an archaeology professor, Mr. Perlman played by Michael Stuhlbarg.

While the main story is about Elio, a very well rounded educated, piano playing, multilingual youngster, coming of age that is experiencing sexual confusion, Oliver is the very handsome, sexy, sexual, amiable stranger who Elio is attracted to.

The main failure of the movie, surprisingly enough, is James Ivory who has written and directed movies that showed sexiness and sex in more rounded, physical, explicit and meaningfulness, such as “Maurice”, than in the screenplay he has written for this film. To a certain extent he is aided and abetted by the director Luca Guadannino.

In a 131 minute film there are, maybe, about 30 moving minutes, one that is funny involving a peach, another of Timothee Chalamant in a silent, moving, several minutes in length headshot and one startling, emotionally involving monologue by Michael Stuhlbarg along with maybe 30 minutes of scenery.

“Call Me by Your Name” is rated R for some hinted at sex, some language and except for Stuhlbarg’s moving, brilliant monologue it was mainly a big disappointment to me."

I love everyone involved in the movie so expectations were very high. But immediately, (IMMEDIATELY) the intrusive, BUSY musical score started to drive a nail into my head. Here were two monologues; letters written by the lead characters about each other. They were smart (if a little precious) and heartfelt and full of nice details. However, the entire time Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were speaking, this wall to wall orchestra kept sawing away, frolicking and gamboling like a Rossini overture underlining the moments with 'whimsy' and the promise of 'heartache.' Like a bright yellow highlight pen, the music left no room for independent thought: I was being told exactly how to feel about every second. But I got through the opening bits; although I didn't quite buy any of the director/actor theatre scenes- Why is that no one ever seems to be able to capture the truth of what it's like to do small theatre? Those ridiculous rehearsal scenes were painful in their ostentatious **** don't get me started on the actual performance of the play. It was almost exactly like that old SNL sketch ""Bad Conceptual Theatre"" - If only Dan Aykroyd had stepped out as Leonard Pinth Garnell to give a review - Even more hilarious was the discovery in a later scene that this awful slice of ""high art"" was slated for Broadway. In what universe? But I stuck with it until the scene where Scarlett Johansson reminds her husband that she finds it difficult to cry onstage only to walk into her bedroom and burst into tears. This is a moment that should've wrecked me. It's beautifully set up, and would have been totally unexpected and rending. But at she walks through the hallway towards her bedroom, the score whips up into a Soap Opera ready string-filled cry of anguish so generic it could have been used for that old Carol Burnett sketch As The Stomach Turns. The camera pulls in to show Scarlett's tear-filled face - but any empathy is immediately **** to the ground by the hideously OVER THE TOP music.

Cut to: this morning as I scanned through the Golden Globe Nominations. Not only is that exercise in bathos and banality actually nominated for Best Original Score... It was written by none other than Randy Newman. Bummer.

If I make it through the movie it will be with the sound off and the subtitles on. I like to decide how I feel about things. I don't need to be smothered in kisses to know I am loved. And I don't need to be swaddled in a treacly, syrupy, honey-laden, jokey, telegraphing soundscape in order to understand that sadness or joy are on display. I'm pretty sure I'm smarter than that. My CATS are definitely smarter than that. It's no coincidence that Bennett coughed up three yards of hairball during the first thirty seconds of the movie."

I was excited to see this because of the trailer, but I'm pretty sure everything in the trailer has already happened and now it's like this, people saying how they feel like it's interesting when it's not. I can't pay attention to anything they're saying, I just keep thinking: straight people problems. I was worried this might happen, seeing how I hate straight people. But I definitely hate these straight people. Spoiler alert! Her mom's exhusband is not only gay, she caught him blowing a guy, which is an example of how the jokes work here too, not just some kind of... it's not homophobia. It's just like.... you know, those straight people I hate who make fun of gay people because they're friends with gay people. It's the gaffer character who says he feels comfortable saying what he does because he was raised by two women, only it's like that guy wrote a movie about marriage called Marriage Story and now I'm not watching it because it's so boooooooring these poor rich straight people have so many problems. I'd rather be watching Love Island at least they're self-aware about how **** what they're saying is **** life"

As I forced myself to continue to watch it in the hope that I eventually would discover the qualities that caused it almost to win the Oscar for best movie, I began to wonder if it would ever end.  Honestly, it was just plain weird in the artsy-fartsy sort of way that critics find appealing but many normal moviegoers find off-putting.  Compared to the classic musicals of Broadway's heyday, it could not even begin to hold a candle.  The one saving grace was the jazz music in the soundtrack, which was of a high quality musically."

1. The obnoxious and distracting camera work. They try and look clever with all these contentious shots. The issue is that ruins the pacing of each scene since it leaves no room for properly edited cuts.

2. The music, the singing and sound mixing are all atrocious. ""Another Day of Sun"" is possibly one of the single worst opening numbers I've witnessed. And I say witnessed, not heard, because you can't hear a damn thing. The music sounds like what you'd hear in an elevator. Competent but boring. The singing is the same, but none of the few decent singers this movie has can harmonise properly. It's hard to notice that problem though, when you can't hear them over the damn music. 3. Yeah... The ""white guy trying to save Jazz"" is problematic as hell. It's like how in RENT all the white people are being gentrified out of their neighbourhood by a black guy... Like, are you freaking kidding me? It doesn't bother me that much, but it's an issue.

Look, if you like this. Hey, that's great and.. No, I can't do this. Like, if you enjoyed this, I genuinely feel sorry you haven't been exposed to better musicals. I mean go look up Hairspray's opening on youtube. That's a song about Baltimore, yet it sounds more inviting than LA. Or go watch ""Singing in the Rain"". Sit down and listen to some of the musical numbers from Wicked or Hamilton or The Book of Mormon. Hell, if you're rich enough go see them while you still can.

There is a world of far, far, faaaaaaaar superior musicals out there for you to enjoy. La La Land is an insult to them all."

2949,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-la-land/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,TheFilmDog,"Apr 16, 2017",0,"My wife and I purchased this film on one of the streaming services and settled in for a pleasant evening of light entertainment on a big screen tv with sound coming from a couple of thousand dollars worth of audio equipment, but it turns out we were all dressed up with no place to go. That is, this multi-Oscar winner turned out to be a loser that let us down on every front.

For those who haven't seen it I won't spoil the story by saying that it appears to be an updated tribute to the old musical romantic comedies. Instead of placing the young boy-girl couple back in time, we see them cavorting on the crowded interstates of modern Los Angeles which feature countless Prius Hybrids rather than elegant RR Silver Clouds. The effect is mildly humorous but not romantic. The lack of musical talent in the two leads is neither funny nor romantic. We were reminded of the fact that long ago most entertainers could sing and dance decently if not wonderfully but today's stars are not that versatile. And it's pretty depressing watching the talent lumber across a screen that the old movie-makers would have killed to use for their productions.  We live in a time of technical marvels. This movie made poor use of them.

Take the matter of color, for example. The look of the old Hollywood musicals was determined in part by the lack of subtlety of the color film available at the time. Knowing the limitations of the medium the old filmmakers used sets that made a kind of fantastic beauty. Everything looked perfect, though unreal. The control that filmmakers have over color today allows for just about any imaginable look. My question is who would choose to dress the characters as if they were in an old Hollywood fantasy and then photograph them against completely realistic backgrounds featuring brown palm trees, wilted flowers, and roads and buildings that remind us that our country's infrastructure is crumbling (one of the few points that people of all political stripes can agree on).

Finally, I'm forced to ask WHY the audience is supposed to care about our lead couple. There's lots of talent out there working its heart out to get some good, steady work. Why should we want this particular duo to make it. They don't seem especially brilliant. When the young lady isn't selected for a part by a rather rude producer, I found myself thinking ""well, I guess he had something else in mind"". I mean, her performance didn't immediately grab me. She didn't jump out at me. And that has happened on occasion hen a great actor does a bit part in a film and you find yourself saying, my god! Who WAS that?!

So all in all another mega hit about Hollywood that got great reviews from people who live in that world--I've noticed that film critics seem to give extra points to movies about making movies. I call it the Barton Fink effect.

Maybe I'm getting old and have seen too many movies. But frankly I don' think that's the problem with a La La production that just seems flat and ugly."

Crash, the Movie that beat Crouching Tiger in the Oscars, and then no one ever watched it or thought about it again?  That's how overrated La La Land is.  La La Land is a little bit different from the stereotypical musical, and wants the viewer to celebrate these tiny progressions as something artistic and revolutionary.  There's no art here.  There's no deeper truth.  This is a sugar-coated musical that mechanically a little bit of conflict, a little bit of drama, a smattering of bittersweet notes in an attempt to seem real and genuine.  But La La Land fails, the script is a **** formula out of a community college drama writing course.  It's as fake and self-congratulatory as the Hollywood film industry, pretending to be brave, when it's really a cookie cutter drama.  The sad thing is that, like Crash, the critics fell for it.

And the next day this film went on to set a record for most Golden Globe awards. Who are these people who think this dreck is anything? It is another in a long line of pathetically pointless postmodern films, it has no direction, no depth, no dramatic tension, nothing to draw you into the story or the characters. Ryan Gosling's an okay actor (I liked him in Lars and the Real Girl and The Big Short) and Emma Stone's a poor one - she's just trying too hard and it was difficult to watch. What was this movie trying to be? A musical? A fantasy? A love story, comedy, drama??? Today's reigning postmodernism allows filmmakers to feel they can string a bunch of vacuous scenes together that appear to have some artistic novelty and think it's quality work. What is most scary is that Millennials eat this up. ""Oh that part is so unique and special and it personally speaks to me because I myself have no direction or meaning in my life!"" I see it in young adults' eyes everywhere. ""There is no truth, I can make my own world, nobody can tell me what to do. And we can dance and sing to it!"" Neither Gosling or Stone did those things very well, and the music was dreadful. It was agony to sit through this narcissistic adulation of nothingness. It got two Metacritic rating points here simply because of the first number."

Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have chemistry as the lovers from the boy meets girl, boy loves girl, boy loses girl in the acting department but are sorely lacking in the singing and dancing department though Gosling acquits himself in piano playing.

Everything you read, including comments by the director and screenwriter Damien Chazelle, has remarks about it being a salute to old Hollywood movies and to Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Judy Garland but,with no disrespect, unless this was a take-off of all mentioned, and even if Charisse's voice was dubbed, ""La La Land"" fails miserably. I have seen some talk about it saluting Jacques Demy and Michel Legrand's movies ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" and ""The young Girls of Rochefort"" which it does in some departments such as the production design by David Wasco and the costume designs by Mary Zophres. Regarding the choreography by Mandy Moore the opening is really a winner but in other scenes she is let down by Stone and Gosling who just don't have it when it comes to doing the steps she has for them. There is one scene where they are dancing in the stars, at the Griffith Observatory planetarium after watching the James Dean movie ""Rebel Without a Cause"", that is more special effects than dancing.

The music by Justin Hurwitz with lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul sort of get lost except for the jazz music which comes across strong, melodic. The love theme lyrics are still somewhat a mystery to me though it is sung and played a few times.

The climax lasting about twenty minutes, a recap of what has taken place for the first 100 minutes, jell everything together but, for me, it was too late.I think I would have been much happier and appreciated the movie, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone just seeing that section.

J.K. Simmons, who was in Chazells's ""Whiplash"" and won an Oscar for his role does a brief cameo here while John Legend does an extended one, neither adding or taking away from the movie.

The bottom line is that ""La La Land"", for me, was not worth the time though I am sure I am in a very small minority. It might have helped if I hadn't seen the Broadway version of ""An American In Paris"" in Miami this past Tuesday where the leads were amazing dancers and strong singers.

The plot beats are the same than the ones of any Disney picture only on a realistic setting/context.

This story was told a gazillion times before and this movie doesn't give any reason to be considered special.

I literally already forgot about this movie, and watched it not long ago.

The three is for the sex scene, which is something I hadn't seen before (at least in this type of movies), and because the acting is really good, only again... inconsequential.

If this is an Oscar movie, then the Oscars aren't that great."

The only interesting character is the mother.  The main character isn't very appealing and at times is a real jerk.  The whole production seems amateurish.  And the entire storyline gets dull real fast.  It's only about 90 minutes long but seems longer because it is rather boring.  I think the director was saddled with a not-so-good script that ends very abruptly.  Basically, this was a coming-of-age drama that should have been so much better.

Well, how about for the first time ever, metacritic has let me down. Can I ask them for a refund? Lol! For those of you who are interested in my opinion, I just found the movie boring. It's basically snapshots **** life and they just weren't that interesting or compelling. I found myself checking the time, shifting in my seat, eating too much popcorn to try and stave off the boredom. It just wasn't for me.

Christine (oh squeeze me, ""Lady Bird""), was everything her mother said she was. Selfish, ungrateful, argumentative and a bit of a user. As the lead character, she wasn't a very nice person. Her mother was mean, a bully, controlling and miserable. Welcome to the 2 lead characters! On the plus side, the supporting characters were mostly delightful! Christine's best friend Jules was so lovely, I want her for my best friend. The father was just a gorgeous, supportive person and even her belligerent brother and his strange girlfriend were more interesting and more open to criticism than ""Lady Bird"" herself. If this is autobiographical in any way, I don't think Greta Gerwig was a very nice teenager! (That's right, I said it, come at me!!!)  In short, I found the movie stale. Nothing new or interesting here. How the hell it got a 94 is still beyond me. That's a bloody high score!!! At least the user score has it lower down the totem pole, with Phantom Thread, The Greatest Showman and Paddington 2 rating higher. I think I'll have to pay more attention to the userscore and less to the metascore in the future. Maybe, if it had a score of 60/70, I wouldn't be so scathing but I feel royally ripped off and I'm never gonna get those 90 mins back.

It didn't deserve even ONE of the nominations, except maybe for best supporting actress (being nominated for best movie, best screenplay and best direction is absolutely bizarre)

Full of empty, shallow dialogues, useless scenes, subplots that are immediately abandoned (it reminded me of The Room), and a lot of boring, stupid characters that are completely unlikable (except for the father). The screenplay and edit are TERRIBLE.

I had already not liked Brooklyn, and didn't find Saoirse Ronan's acting so great then (that movie also ****), but her nomination for best actress is another thing I can't understand. Not only her acting is just ""meh"", she is totally unconvincing as a teenager school girl."

I even tried watching it for a second time in case I'm missing something, but even after the second try I still felt nothing.

My hunch is that many critics like this movie because (given our embattled world these days) they hunger for lightweight reassuring fluff and - poor schmucks- could not see that this is “faux” lightweight reassuring fluff !

The leader of that pack was Tree of Life, which was laughably bad.  We go to movies virtually every week, and we always check Metacritic ratings which provide guidance, but not strong enough to be a sole determinant of our interest.  These kinds of movies are, in my view, actually  produced for critics, perhaps to win one of those esoteric Cannes-type festival awards, irrespective of commercial success.  This movie was 165 minutes L  O  N  G and could have been half as long. The final scene was so very typical, dwelling on Ines still and emotionless face for what seemed like a minute. There were several shots like that.  And the movie pinballed all over the place and was difficult to follow. It was mostly in Germany, switching sort of seamlessly to French, English and Romanian, making it even more difficult to follow.  We sort of get the message, having worked in corporations and as a consultant. And we've all seen or been part of dysfunctional relationships between adult children and their parents.  Nothing particular was illuminated here. Perhaps the reason I gave this a 2 was Metacritic's professional critics averaged 93, which is ludicrous.  We have seen movies in the 50s that were far more entertaining."

What was the last funny German comedy you saw? What was the last 3 hour funny comedy you saw?

At the Gateway Theatre in Fort Lauderdale they have a section where audience members can post cards with what they thought of the movie they just saw and I put “Awful—even worse than “Neruda”—see my review of Tuesday February 7th.

In a running time of 2 hours and 45 minutes I found a total of 6 to7 minutes that got me to smile and in those 6 to 7 minutes, maybe 2 minutes, which were old fashioned slapstick making it seem like a comedy.

The film is primarily a daughter, Ines, played by Sandra Huller, and father, Winifred alias Toni, played by Peter Simonischek, story. The father is a child who never grew up and the daughter a workaholic always wheeling and dealing, a lot on the phone, and having to put up with the sexism of the work place.

Winifred puts on a wild wig and uses false teeth to bring some fun into his daughter’s life whether it is at the workplace where she seems to play along in order to avoid embarrassment or in what little private life she has. The film takes that 2 hour and 45 minutes to show the results.

There are a couple of full frontal/rear male/female scenes with one really generating a good laugh but if you think watching a guy **** on a petit-four or another one sitting on whoopee cushion is funny than maybe this movie is for you.

“Toni Erdmann” does have a couple of touching scenes but what film dealing with a father and daughter at odds with each other doesn’t?

It is only the 7th week into the new year and I already have 2 of the worst films on my yearly list."

3048,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/uncut-gems/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,MarkHReviews,"Dec 27, 2019",3,"Act One of “Uncut Gems” includes footage from a colonoscopy.  It’s by far the most probing, thoughtful, well-paced and illuminating scene in the film.

This film was written and directed by the Safdie Brothers, the current “next big thing” in movie-making.  Their 2017 film “Good Time” with Robert Pattinson was selected to compete for the Palme d’Or, the highest prize at Cannes.  Their films have been described by “Variety” as “raucously interior inner-city films” that are “contemporary, raw and untethered.”

“Uncut Gems” has been ten years in the making.  It is based on family lore told by the Safdies’ father, who worked in the diamond district of New York City.  The film’s central character, Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), is a diamond merchant and compulsive gambler doing everything he can to stay one step ahead of the debt collectors.  Howard imports a blood opal from Africa in the body of a fish, he makes wildly implausible bets on NBA games, he gets locked naked in the trunk of his own car while attending his daughter’s school play, he gets thrown into a fountain.  After that, the action picks up.  Unfortunately, it’s all just mania in search of a purpose.

While some moviegoers may experience this film as one long adrenaline rush, for me the frantic pace and too-close hand-held cameras were simply exhausting.  The film offers zero character development – Howard is apparently genetically incapable of introspection, much less learning from his incessant mistakes.  In fairness, there is one moment of personal insight in Act Three.  Of course, this flash of self-awareness is discarded immediately.  The film’s climactic scene is shocking, but completely unearned.

We all know people like Howard – people who use baseless bravado to hide their insecurity, people who are so self-absorbed they either don’t know or don’t care about the carnage they inflict on family and friends as the lurch through life.  In that sense, “Uncut Gems” is an accurate slice of life.  But that doesn’t make this film insightful or profound.  It just adds to our trauma as we’re forced to observe the fast-moving train wreck.  The dialogue is staggering in its self-indulgence.  If the f-bombs were removed, the running time would be about 20 minutes.  The profanity isn’t shocking or offensive, just monotonous.

My guess is that this is one of those films that is adored by professional film critics, but will generate “Huh? What?” from a lot of regular movie-goers.  If that’s the case, “Uncut Gems” almost makes me believe in populism."

3054,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-is-true/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,KenR,"Feb 12, 2020",3,"It’s curious that we have a movie about William Shakespeare bearing a name like All Is True when the largest portion of it may well not be. But of course, how could any of this be known when it all took place so very long ago and, so little survives or had been recorded about the famous Bard. Writer Ben Elton has donned both his creative hats for this concoction – that of total fictional fabrication and ‘what we think to know’ presumptions. Director/actor Kenneth Branagh while wanting to accurately transcribe the times may have forgotten that it’s also important to entertain his audience and allow them to enjoy the visual treats of sets, costumes, and creating a mood via creative lighting. His sets are so gloomily lit there’s a tenancy to lull the viewer to sleep. A particularly slow pace could even leave some reaching for the 2 x times remote.  This need not have been - broad subjects such as this, set in dark times, under other great lighting/cameramen have allowed us to be transported back to bygone candle/gaslight days by using deep blacks and well-lit subjects that allowed viewers to feel the era and enjoy the rich moods simultaneously. For an artificial interpretation of reality, a thinking audience will forgive any production that considers their visual appreciation over sombre moods.

Modern liberties seem to have been catered for by suggesting that Will’s Sonnets may have been written for another bloke – in this case, the Earle of Southampton. Not sure where Elton came up with this suggestion as there doesn’t appear all that much documentation to build on that assumption.  We learn that Mr Shakespeare did not attend University, somewhat proving that a University degree can’t always account for intelligence, and that his wife Anne was illiterate. There are other family intrigues to offer personal interest but what promised to be an enlightening experience comes across as a tad too heavy-handed and at times inaccessible.    Performances are good but still remains for dedicated Shakespeare followers only, and some won’t even last the distance – it’s not that it's overlong, just takes it’s time telling its (largely fabricated) story."

Everything from the color correction, the acting, the editing, the laughable CGI, to the set design looked like a cheap television show. The characters were hilariously underwritten and poorly developed. Lets take a look at the main characters of Doctor Sleep. First we have hipster witch **** who was the most cliché and uninspired villain Hollywood has seen in a long while. Her costume design alone was enough to send shivers down my spine. Next we have teenage supergirl who was completely lifeless, poorly acted, and was a constant reminder that this movie was very likely intended for a much younger audience. Then we have a generic alcoholic version of Renton from Trainspotting who really did a great job playing an addict. (Just kidding go watch **** Trainspotting) What really busted my nut was the recurring homages to Kubrick which served as constant reminders of how good The Shining is and how bad this movie is. I laughed out loud when I saw the continued attempts to recreate iconic shots from The Shining as if it would trick the audience into believing the two films were even close to being on the same level. I know it’s most likely not fair to compare this film to one of the greatest horror movies of all time but it’s incredibly difficult not to when you see the repeated attempts to recreate what Kubrick envisioned. How can the audience be expected not to compare these two films when the only moments of genuine cinematic style in Doctor Sleep are blatant recreations of scenes from The Shining. Not one moment of this movie was interesting, thrilling, unique, or necessary."

Sono andato a vedere questo film per caso, e se avessi saputo che sarebbe stato tedioso in questa maniera, avrei sicuramente optato per la classica commedia di Natale. Badate bene che parlo da NON filmofilo, ma di appassionato di culturafantasy, dunque non disprezzo a priori opere simili. Disprezzo però quando un film è insulso, sconclusionato, e l'unico modo di dargli spessore sia quello di ""usare chiavi di lettura"" che trasformano completamente il film in qualcosa che NON ESISTE. Se avessi voluto leggere un trattato di etica, avrei letto un saggio, non mi sarei visto un film la cui trama è ""dei tizi brutti e cattivi per vivere devono assorbire l'energia di alcuni bambini speciali, a caso nasce un bambino ancora più speciale che riesce a spaccare senza motivo i tizi brutti e cattivi, e viene aiutato in questo da un altro bambino speciale che però è diventato adulto ed è uno sfigato alcolizzato"". Ora, posso anche soprassedere sulla banalità della trama di per sé, perché la maggior parte delle storie fantasy hanno la peculiarità di essere razionalizzabili, ma non posso soprassedere sulla completa mancanza di approfondimenti o spiegazioni sul funzionamentoorigine di questi poteri. Non puoi raccontare una storia dove la magia è elemento PRINCIPALE, senza spiegarne il minimo funzionamento. Tra l'altro manca completamente qualsiasi riferimento o dettaglio sull'origine del cattivo, il ché una cosa insensata che cozza con le basi nella stesura di un qualsiasi racconto fantasy. Io però so benissimo perché non è stato fatto tutto ciò, perché è tutto così vago: serve a spingere lo spettatore di credere di essere davanti ad una storia ""complessa"", che richiede studio ed approfondimento. Consente inoltre al regista di fregarsene completamente della coerenza logica, e di far fare ai protagonisti un po' quel che vogliono, tanto non ha spiegato come funziona nulla, tutto è possibile. E' un metodo insulso non di fare cinema, ma proprio di impostare una sceneggiaturastoria. La realtà è che il film è un ricorrere di scenette sconclusionate tra loro, piene di jumpscare totalmente inutili, ed ancor peggio fraseggi filosofici di caratura infima tanto per far credere allo spettatore ""oh ma stanno parlando di etica, non può essere un film banale"". Veramente è un film di una povertà concettuale imbarazzante, tant'è che io non ci credevo che la storia fosse realmente ""ci sono i cattivi > arriva bambino speciale > uccide a caso tutti > fine"". Non ci credevo, perché oggettivamente non poteva essere così, ed invece quest'ombra colossale di banale oscenità mi ha ricoperto dopo 1h di visione, dove in fondo era palese che alla fine il succo fosse quello. La fotografia è apprezzabile, ma anche qui non siamo ai livelli di un Joker, dunque non prenderete dei frame e li incornicerete in stanza. Veramente non ho idea di cos'altro scrivere. La protagonista femminile ""cattivona"" è una gran bella donna, ma non so quanto questo possa valorizzare il tutto. C'è un multiculturalismo non indifferente, in questo film troverete qualsiasi sotto-classificazione antropologica esistente, tanto da risultare stucchevole. Da ridere c'è il fatto che dopo la visione fossi shockato, ed ho discusso con la mia ragazza che invece credeva di aver visto un capolavoro. Lei insisteva sui temi filosofici celati, la chiave di lettura. Io insistevo sul fatto che una ""chiave di lettura"" debba dare spunti di riflessione a spettatori particolarmente sensibili, non dare un senso ad una storia, che di per sé senso non ne ha. Anche perché non siamo di fronte ad un film riflessivo, artistico, ma di fronte ad un film veramente stile trash anni 90, dove ad un certo punto dopo le 2h, anche il regista si è stufato, e risolve la vicenda con una bella sparatoria tra buoni e cattivi ( la scena forse più trash ed oscena dell'intero film ). Il problema è sempre il solito: le persone giudicano un prodotto ancora prima di averne fruito."

They had so much potential to make a sequel to The Shining and they executed it like this. It was a huge disappointment for me. This movie does have a talented cast but they are put into such a disappointing movie. I thought that Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Ferguson did a great job and bring some enjoyment to this film but their characters are incredibly weak. I don’t how it was possible to make an already existing and developed character weak but they did that to Danny Torrance in this movie. His only character trait is that he wants to help people but that’s it. Rebecca Ferguson’s character is pretty weak too. Her only motivation is that she wants to live for a while which is fine but she has no character to back it up. Although, there are sequences with her character that are visually interesting and peaked my interest a little bit. I thought the story was fine I guess. I have never read the Doctor Sleep novel so I can’t say whether it was faithful or not. The 3rd act was dreadful though. All it was was hey do you remember how great The Shining was over and over again. It recreated a bunch of scenes from the original and somehow managed to make them worse. It’s solely relying on if you remember The Shining or not instead of being interesting. There are only two aspects of the 3rd act I appreciated. I thought that the score rendition of The Shining theme was good albeit not as iconic as the original theme and there is a Jack Nicholson look alike that does a pretty good job at looking and sounding like Jack Nicholson. I can’t say that for all of the look alikes though. Instead of finding people who looked like Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd, they just completely recast them and it’s terrible. Doctor Sleep is 2 and a half hours long and it does not deserve that runtime. They should have just cut it down to just about 2 hours. The added time just makes parts of the film flat out boring. There are some other technical aspects that I thought were bad. There is this stupid heartbeat sound effect they use at least 30-40 times throughout the film and it is incredibly annoying and some of the visuals later in the film looked pretty bad. Overall, Doctor Sleep may have some good performances but it's over reliance on being related to The Shining, being much longer than it should, and weak characters make this one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me."

With a painfully protracted runtime of 2:32 and a storytelling approach that inexplicably vacillates between campy romp and trite horror fare, filmmaker Mike Flanagan's directorial skills simply aren't up to paying homage to the artistry of the predecessor picture's creator, especially in one particularly grotesque sequence that's flat out in stupendously bad taste. What's more, the writing and acting are frequently laughable, so horrendously awful that I often found myself chuckling over material that I probably wasn't supposed to be laughing at.

King's story was a simple original high concept, the best kind to adapt into a movie.  Kubrick in his genius wisely constructed ambiguity allowing for interpretation of its events.  And Nicholson gave one of the most memorable and since referenced performances in cinema history.  This tricky sequel is King at his worst with his penchant for over-the-top supernatural, and it's not really a true sequel but a quasi remake by young dumb Hollywood in the trendy practice of greatest hits reunion tribute antics riffing on everything via reenactments of the original (locations, sets, costumes, props, sound effects, music, dialogue, shots, scenes) rather than a continuation of or new story.  That's what these way later sequels do now.  They serve as reboots remixing the same old content which taints the original far worse than any attempt at originality would."

This movie is a Disasterpiece. I saw an early screening on Monday and could've/should've walked out in the first 5 min. There’s a lot I could say about Doctor Sleep without giving away the plot. But the movie is not even worth the effort of a review. It’s that bad. Mike Flanagan attempts to perform a juggling act by writing the screenplay, directing, DP'ing, and editing the entire **** boy did it show, as he drops the ball mostly in the areas of plot and performances

Plot/Suspense: I’m not a crazy Shining fan, I am a Kubrick fan, I thought Kubrick was one of the most creative directors. And his touch on the Shining is what made it truly one of the creepiest things I’ve ever seen. He built his movie through slow dread. Doctor sleep on the other hand only makes the audience dread how long the movie will be. The story is all over the place. Literally, different times and places, making it a pain for the audience to follow. Character: Kubrick's characters and themes are complex, whereas Doctor Sleeps are superficial and fall flat. They lack depth and substance. The antagonists are uninteresting, underdeveloped, with 0 arc, and worst of all not scary in the least. Setting: A scary movies greatest asset is setting. Kubricks setting is confined, secluded, in a haunted hotel, with antagonist and protagonist snowed in together, making for an extremely terrifying experience. In Doctor Sleep setting is tossed out the window. It's an open world, with 0 confinement. And when the movie reaches confined spaces it's too worried about matching the Shining to try and create something that would've surprised the audience. This movie shows that not every Stephen King novel should be adapted. It reminds me A LOT of Dreamcatcher. You could say Doctor Sleep is Dreamcatcher 2.0."

Other than that, Sing is a rushed movie on so many aspects.  One being that the whole story changes because of something so stupid and unrealistic (an eyeball falling out of a lizards head), they should have put more thought into that. Another being that they use animals instead of humans, and they don't even act like Animals.  Disney's ""Zootopia"" at least follows the basis that they are still animals, even though they are basically human, they still have animal traits that have a roll on the story of Zootopia, Sing falls short in that.  The characters really feel bland and not interesting and hard to love.

Thus every character in this film comes off as one dimensional and boring. with one exception, Johnny  the Gorilla. The only other good part about this movie is the ending scene which is when, shock of all shock, the characters actually preform full musical numbers. you see in the majority of the film we don't get full musical numbers just pits of the characters singing.

The production itself is mainly dark, which is understandable in a film like this and the director Craig William Macneill handles both the frontal nudity and the mother getting the ’40 wacks and her father 41’ discreetly up to a point. By the way, if the wacks are a spoiler you are too young to see this movie.

Chloe Sevigny, as Lizzie, is okay but she has yet to really impress me. Kristen Stewart, as the maid Bridget, adds another intriguing acting job in an independent film as she has done since playing Bella Swan in The Twilight Saga.

The cast including Jamey Sheridan as the father, Fiona Shaw as his wife, Kim **** as Lizzie’s sister Emma and Dennis O’Hare as an uncle all deliver the goods.

Run All Night

And we meet again. The writer Brad Ingelsby fascinates me. His writing procedure, his character and the way they travel in his plot tracks is equally intriguing. They take detours, they take uncalled stops, they bump into randomness and they also ask us to stop this everlasting train. And I know I usually give credit, at first. to the director who in this case is Jaume Collet-Serra. I just wanted to swoon over Brad's filmography and how it has caught my eye over the years. Not that I have anything new to add to those already said and observed things. This project, the stereotypical action thriller and it is extremely typical in its genre, has something else that I'd loved and exhaled over. It is its irrelevantly fast edited scenarios.

And not some physical action sequence but even a conversation is crisply edited out. No. Not crisply, but wrongly. Multiple times we can see the dialogues lapped over physical sequences to pace up the film in a briskly adventurous night. What it instead results into is a disappointing questionable set of scenarios that doesn't respect anything. Neither the action nor the characters nor the actors and what they are diving or dying or performing for is accounted into a disrespectful character.

Character, I say, for it repeatedly pops up on screen and also has his own arc in the sense that it gets less and less visible and annoying. Run All Night seems, is simply terribly edited. It cuts to another frame within a blink or like a blink. It feels unintentional, wrong and doesn't quite add up. There is a disturbance between conversation. This violence is much louder than any other explosives and bangs. And on the other hand, the final act is incredibly slow and settling which in its own way makes up for that uncalled editing that jumps back and forth."

Granted, the basic plotline is not too bad: Edie and Patsy are old and slowly losing their fabulous lifestyle they used to enjoy. There is quite a few important issues here: ageing, careers, sexism, materialism, etc. However, that is where the ingenuity ends. The execution of the film is utterly ridiculous. While the show used to be very sarcastic and basically make fun of people like Edie and Patsy, now that aspect of the story is lost. Their characters are shallow. There was no *real* character development from when the show ended in the 90's up until this moment - something that was supposed to happen.
Otherwise, the acting is a bit too slapsticky from everyone, as well as the entire production just seemed somehow as fake as the CGI background behind Kate Moss.

The police chasing Patsy and Eddy should have been drawn out and comical. Leaving Safron's daughter at the hotel to work as a maid should have been as meaningful as when Patsy sold Saffy in Morocco. They should have been detained at the airport for Patsy's suspicious items and had her inspected to where she enjoys it. A bomb threat at the airport or a fire alarm provides their escape or something from the airport. The one Patsy was going to marry should have been drawn out. Patsy gets to go to bed with him and dies in the middle of love making or something, spoiling their plans. She steals what she can from the house and makes a get away. When she marries the richest woman, she has to put a strap-on and doesn't know how to use. A comical scene could happen when she uses other items - a banana, a shoe, something funny.

It’s another stifling example of a British television show turning up on the big screen trying to capture the Inbetweeners movie’s massive Box Office success and rather unlike that film, it’s also a truncating mess, it can never pick a plot and stick with it.  The comedy is all over the place.  If you think the cameos in Ghostbusters are weird and don’t work, try the cameos in Ab Fab the movie, it all feels like the plot is being made to facilitate the cameos rather than the cameos being made to facilitate the plot.  There are some bafflingly weird ones, which if I mentioned all of them, we would be here for a long time, and I don’t have enough time for that.  I will say at least that Joanna Lumley is good at getting back to her role as Patsy and is easily the funniest person in the cast.  Though special props to Rebel Wilson who delivers a decent cameo."

This charmless and unfunny re-incarnation falls far short of the high standards initially set by the early TV instalments and doesn’t even reach the level of a low brow ‘Carry On’ film. The story is almost non-existent and scenes with potential are not allowed to develop beyond a punchline or funny joke, most of which fail miserably anyhow. Slapstick is the order of the day and the results are pathetic. Characters, like Bubble and Saffron, who were irritating anyway are just downright annoying here. Equally the positive roster of guest stars including Joan Collins, Christopher Biggins Barry Humphries and Lulu have all seen better parts and, indeed, better days. Thank god for Joanna Lumley who even with such dismal material still manages to make meals out of less than witty throw aways. Sadly, though, even she has to keep the choke out to prevent her motor from stalling. Ultimately, like the refrigerators discovered to be empty of champagne, this big screen misfire lacks any fizz."

The cast deserves better than this. Because it's the dynamic between Kyle Chandler, Ken Watanabe and Ziyi Zhang is what made the scenes they share more tolerable despite some atrocious dialogue and unbearably cringe-worthy one-liners. And because Millie Bobby Brown could have single-handedly made the formulaic dramatic arc work if it wasn't for the fact the film went for the action from the get-go and for almost the entire first 40 minutes, which is basically consists of a set of crammed together segments of non-stop action and explosions which are all devoid of the slightest tension.

After showing many monsters on screen, for a reason or no reason, to give those who hated Godzilla what they wanted, the plot began to unravel. But the rest of the movie isn't actually any better. As the more the story proceeds, the clearer it appears how superficial and uninspired it is. I liked both Gareth Edwards's Godzilla and Jordan Vogt-Roberts's Kong: Skull Island, so it's not like I can't stand a mindless creature feature, but this is just extremely poorly made. Even the CGI that most people were praising I found quite disappointing. King Ghidorah, in particular, looks so cartoonish. I mean, Disney's Hercules's Hydra looks more realistic!

Barely show the monsters, specially fighting, and when you do, do it at night when you can barely see anything.
Have a cast of unlikable human beings that are a drag to the story and you con't care about them at all, and then let them interrupt the few good moments the movie has.
Add some SJW BS like women, specially the main character bossing every men around (just watch, I don't know, Dr Who, or Picard, or STD, and you see tha same), add some climate change propaganda (the Monsters are here because we are killing the world.

The biggest immersion breaker was the reason Dr. Emma Russell gave for freeing all the monsters. I didn't buy it because it was dumb.. I didn't like Kyle Chandler. And Millie Bobby Brown was fine but all she did was cry.. I liked the scene with Ken Watanabe and Godzilla. It was the only scene I liked other than all the monster fights. Charles Dance is a great actor but he wasn't great in this one. I think the character he played was boring. None of these characters you really care about. The monster fights were cool and looked incredible. The problem is they showed too much of the humans. And I just didn't care. This could of been awesome.. The story needed better writing and characters.. The characters had no depth to them. They were boring and unlikable.

Godzilla looks like Godzilla, Mothra like Mothra , King Ghedora like he is suppose to look. So I was happy with that. What very little monster fighting this movie had was ok. Every thing else ****. The 2014 Godzilla movie was ok mainly due to Bryan Cranston who is a great actor and gave you some one to care about unfortunitly they killed him half through that movie and man was that a mistake. This movie really could have used him. I didn't care one bit for one person in this movie. Infact I hated them all outside of the one Japanese guy who was in the 2014 Godzilla movie who barely did any thing in this one. I was just so damn bored with this movie. the Human element was so god awful that I wanted to just get up and walk out of this pile of trash. The action was minimal. It did the same stupid thing Godzilla 2014 did. show you 10-20 seconds of action then go back to the boring human characters. I pay to see a Godzilla movie to see a bunch of giant monsters go at each other and I got less then the bare minimum. This was my number one want to see movie this year and I feel so let down. They got it so right with Kong Skull island. I felt so satisfied with that movie or some thing like the first Pacific Rim gave you plenty of Robot vs Monster action and if you were expecting any thing close to that ,you will be massively let down.

This did allow for effects like lightning and energy to appear more vibrant, though the monsters often blended into the scenery. In a film about monsters larger than life, no fight scene focused on the monsters for more than a few seconds. Fights would last a minute or so, but only centered on the actual monsters for the beginning and conclusion to the fight. Similar to Pacific Rim 2 in that the best fight was saved for the end, but different in that each fight cut away to humans running away consistently enough to pull you out of the film.

The director lied ""Godzilla got double time on scene compare to the 2014 one"" and should be hold accountable. Well you can argue he didn't lie, but imagine this. There's Titan fight scene that last 60 seconds. The 1st 5 seconds is overview shot that show who will fight who and one of them throw the first punch. Then the next 45 seconds the camera switch to some dudes running around the fight, with occasionally glimpse of either titans' foot or tail that randomly enter the camera at the background. Then for the last 10 seconds the camera zoom out and show the winner and the other run away or die. Yeah in previous movie it's 30 seconds of full fight and other 30 seconds of characters doing other thing.

And they made that into a big-budget movie, word for word, with effects that look exactly like 1997 video-game graphics.  That's Godzilla.  It's just the most idiotic infantile thing you ever saw. Every lame, tired cliche from previous disaster movies is included like a recipe:

* Great big video-game monstas that move real slow and walk real loud;
* Constant ""SHOOM... SHOOOM... SHOOOOOM!"" sound effects;
* The gay-glasses-guy who wisecracks annoyingly but un-funnily all through the film;
* The child who gets separated from parents and is constant danger;
* Lame, blue-toned video-game CGI;
* Separated family members screaming ""NOOOO!"" as they get separated;
* The music and monsta-fight-noise stop politely when characters need to have an emotional talk during the crisis;
* Explosions and massive flying objects moving WAY too fast, but somehow missing everybody;
* Blubbering family reunion at the end.

Since it seems to have been written by a 7th grader, it really doesn't quite make sense and after a while, it's impossible to follow the narrative (if any), with all the scene and character changes -- like how they all suddenly end up in Boston when they were just in Mexico or the Gulf of Mexico?

Godzilla: King Of The Monsters

Dougherty is neither answering nor raising the questions. Oddly enough, the director, Michael Dougherty is also responsible for this chalky screenplay that he co-wrote with Zack Shields. But why would they work hard, if clashing towering mythological creatures painted by a bucket full of mashed cgi, could make its audience drool and fill the pocket of the banner with tons and tons of gold- maybe this was too much. At least the makers won't be able to judge someone by that, after what they have pulled off in this latest installment of a long going franchise. But I sincerely, want to go through this. What is it, that makes us giddy up for more of this monster debacle?

Is it the inner child in us, that sees the world with such one dimensional view? Or is it that stereotypical punching bag feeling? Exerting rage for a cathartic release, that we have been piling up for the whole week and are about to take it all out on a popcorn bag. It is not the SMASH SMASH SMASH, as much as it looks like. It is not. For, unlike MCU, they are not focusing a lot on the choreography of the battle, it is still dull. But I'd hardly blame the so called true king of the monsters.

It is the humans I find it difficult to bear on screen. We are told over and over again, to go through the same rigmarole of ""Run! Run! Run!"". The pitched in emotions are shallow, ergo, the entire track of unnecessarily long cast gets thrown off in the garbage. So, there must be something they have got it right? Yes, there is, claiming it to be mythology- which it is not of that subtext at all- the fanboys are going to have a time of their lives, as all their suffering-- if they consider it to be-- over the ages is about to come alive in the form of Godzilla: King Of The Monsters, roaring with his heart out in a gargantuan IMax screen."

3183,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/morgan/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,PipeC,"Sep 24, 2016",3,"Will Ridley Scott Be Proud of The Directional Debut of His Son?

Science fiction, a genre that stops working and self-destructs over time, it is  buried into a deadline as hesitant and  battered as any other genre that Hollywood exploits until the total exacerbation of it. For some time, the dearth of purely new ideas has been a cinematic pandemic that has potentially harmed the big and powerful global film studios, such alarming lack is responsible for the weekly remakes and reboots of already released movies or films with attractive outward appearance, which contain aspects and developments technically copied. This is the regrettable event of Luke Scott. Carrying upon his shoulders the 'Scott' surname must not be easy, in view that his father, the selfsame Ridley S. is responsible for some cult classic movies and one of the film directors more relevant and influential of the recent years; It may be that this pressure caused that the last film of the novice director, ""Morgan"", to deliver a film with existential and philosophical discourses, which did not fulfill what it asserted. It is a shame that Ridley would give his consent to one imitation less sophisticated and profound from ""Ex Machina"", perhaps, it was a family thing or just one explicit 'artificial intelligence'.

The story by Seth W. Owen takes us into a world set in the future, in which the possibility of being a creator of life is openly feasible. Around the reused premise, a group of scientists, geographically isolated, create stable human hybrids with scientific and technological aspirations. The crux of the plot is that said perfect human being, conceived by genetic manipulation, starts to develop a more complicated thought phase, one in which humanized emotions and feelings can be unexpectedly dangerous. There is no problem in telling a story that’s been told before in this kind of films, provided that they institute it a  dissimilar style and a different use that aim to offer a solid and powerful contribution to the general idea. The previous rule did not regulate the film of Luke Scott, considering that besides not give an inherently intelligent response to well-known story, living in the shadow of several classics of science fiction - among them, some of his father - and tries to innovate becoming the little it had been achieved in an incoherent horror-thriller filled with unjustified violence.

""Ex Machina"", the Sci-Fi surprise of 2015 is its illustrious mentor. The acclaimed work of the English novelist, screenwriter, film producer and director; Alex Garland, has a connection with most of its ambitions and motivations with ""Morgan"", even so, despite the fact that its director, Luke Scott, affirmed that was not aware of the fantastic film of Alicia Vikander until after the post-production of the film, ""Morgan"" feels like a lighter version of it, with a budget much smaller, with a completely distant approach and with wholly disconcerting results. In addition to that movie, the film seems to be based on the mythical ""Frankenstein"" by Mary Shelley, another nightmare that has been treated in a thousand ways - thousand and one with this - in where the creation of artificial life is limited by the own human foibles. In a nutshell, ""Morgan"" does not possess the same paced of those movies, since it lacks of reflective questions that forge science fiction, questions such as: in what will a machine affect to humanity, why does it deserve to stay, will they perish someday.

The infinite flaws of the movie focuses on the performances of its squandered cast. Despite having actors and actresses as prestigious as for getting some nominations in the Academy Awards, the spectrum around the film manages to diminish the potential of the cast to zero. We have an unrecognizable Kate Mara - and not precisely by her physical appearance -, who plays the main role, Lee Weathers, a cold and dry professional that takes care of finding the answer to problems with secret investigations, who from the beginning showed herself indifferent and inert. You will be taken aback with the performance of Mara, which although it is justifiable in the final stretch, exceeds the insipidness and lividity required for the character. Similarly happens with Anya Taylor-Joy, the little gem with a wonderful and blessed future of ""The VVitch"", she is hidden in almost the entire length of the film under the depth and darkness of her grey sweatshirt, giving a performance somewhat blundering and very regular in the designated role, so , comparisons with Vikander are unnecessary. Concerning what is referred the supporting cast, they verge on the ridiculous and only a few manage to explore the small potential of their characters with tenacity and peculiarities characteristic of the own actors (Rose Leslie and Michelle Yeoh). Thus, the appropriate definition for the debut of Scott would be a wasted opportunity, a poorly developed opportunity, an opportunity that should never have happened. Slow paced, formulaic and boring, ""Morgan"" takes refuge in the luxuries of ""Ex Machina"" and fatefully becomes in a thriller film that prioritizes action more than its motivations. This is the only movie with an unexpected ending that I wasn't surprised, and sadly is destined to succumb in the lugubrious and painful area of the worst films of the year. Luke, I'm sorry, perhaps next time."

The film starts out with an interesting concept, building up these kids that have the ability to move through space; in effect teleport. It's an interesting contrast to the very realistic and grounded tone of the film, as there's nothing else supernatural or sci-fi happening, and no attention is really drawn to the fact that these kids teleport. They start a sub-plot where the father is abusive to the kids only for... nothing.

That's the entire film. The build up these two disparate topics and then the film just ends. There's no resolution, no arc, not even any real drama or intrigue. They establish the basic themes only to have nothing at all happen. They could have reduced everything in this film down to about 20 minutes and it'd make for an interesting opening to a film, but as it stands it's a drawn out boring film, that have an interesting concept, and makes you feel cheated when it does absolutely sod all with it.

Aqui temos como gênero drama cômico, e até então não há nada de errado nisso, pois há filmes como O Lobo de Wallstreet, dirigido por Martin Scorsese, que mesmo tendo um lado cômico mais acentuado que este próprio filme, não peca em trabalhar temas como Abuso de drogas, prostituição, lifestyle da vida de um corretor e não ficam devendo na profundidade de cada personagem ali apresentado - é muito importante ressaltar isso, pois devemos desvincular a ideia de que uma obra cômica não pode se aprofundar sobre seus temas e personagens. Aqui, a diretora escolhe não levar a obra tão a sério, e como consequência não há verossimilhança, não acreditamos que o que estamos vendo é real, logo fica dificílimo se pôr no lugar dos personagens, pois não há um estudo de personagem convincente e muitas coisas parecem convenientes pro roteiro funcionar, como a garota que o protagonista gosta falando que deve ser horrível baterem numa *garota* e logo depois sumir da trama, ou seu pai relevando algo pesadíssimo justo no momento que o filme precisava. Fora o alívio cômico que a dupla de Susan Sarandon e Linda Emond fazem o filme todo, o que nos leva a pensar ""poxa, se a vó dela não está levando a situação a sério, fazendo piadas o tempo todo, porque eu deveria levar?""

E tudo isso que eu falei leva a um problema estrutural que é recorrente nas produções da Netflix e assola esse filme, que é estar direcionado a um nicho. O que limita seu poder de passar o conhecimento a frente e apenas conta coisas que o público alvo já sabe. O real problema é que quando o filme tenta dispor de temas tão complexos de maneira tão artificial, como a transexualidade, a falta de um pai na vida de uma criança - ou a diversidade de uma família - e o impacto que isso trás ao seu psicológico é que a se abre uma margem para más interpretações por parte de quem nunca teve um contato com os temas propostos, se tornando um desserviço."

Jim Carrey, lui, est un cas à part, il joue bien, mais semble totalement hors du film, en roue libre ( ce n'est pas péjoratif ) et même, a réussi à me faire esquisser un sourrire, là où le film me tire une larme salée.

The film trumps up a competition between captain and first mate that goes nowhere and creates ridiculous and unnecessary foreshadowing, before leading to a downright comical conclusion. If you believe historical accounts, it is true that this ship was sunk by a whale, but the notion that the whale stalked the crew for weeks thereafter is ludicrous, let alone the shred of humanity the filmmakers tried to imbue in it.

Moreover, none of the actors are believably Bostonian whalers and the CGI isn't very good either (I saw it in IMAX 3D so I'm not getting cheated there). Even in 2015, fake water still looks like fake water. And the nastiness of being stranded is painfully obscured by the PG-13 rating, though you can look forward to some unpleasant whaling footage.

Perhaps the worst sin is that they missed out on the true story. The survivalism of the crew is fascinating, but is compressed into a few scenes. An anecdote about the crew burning down an entire island by accident, a golden cinematic opportunity, isn't in the film at all, nor are some of their other adventures. Thinly drawn trope characters are allowed to replace whatever genuine story inspired Melville to write his famous novel. Time is wasted on using Melville as a framing device. Though, in truth, the whole movie ends up being a waste of time."

The movie is also too long. There are MANY elements that are not relevant to the main plot, but they still show it anyway. And also some of the scenes are actually silly, it's actually laughable.

As a longtime fan of the Monster Hunter series, I was terrified of the day that Hollywood would come around to **** this glorious franchise. Why the hell did it have to be Paul WS Anderson? This movie was completely unnecessary. Absolutely nobody except the producers with dollar signs in their eyes wanted this film.

Where do I even begin, I legit don't remember the main character's name and I'm not even 100% sure that we're ever even told her name in the first place. This film has zero plot whatsoever, it just limps around **** it's self along the way. With the turds being what I think is supposed to resemble monster hunts? The ""hunts"" are so hard to follow with constant jump cuts and nonsense. Each monster has a single roar that is just repeated full boar the entire fight. The music is all uninspired and generic action wub wubs.

Now on to what pissed me off with this film... How the f*ck is this supposed to represent Monster Hunter? This isn't Monster Hunter, it's goddamn Gate. There is so little Monster Hunter anything in this film outside of a few monsters and like 3 weapons that are generic iron weapons. You can tell that Paul played MHW for like 2 hours and that was it. The lack of knowledge is shocking to me, how do you get away with making a film adaptation with such little understanding of the source material? The Diablos straight up tries to eat them at one point, never mind that fact that Diablos are herbivores. The film then acts like Rathalos is the ultimate end all monster and terrified by all. Come on, I eat Rathalos steaks for breakfast.

The absolute number one thing that broke me though, was the ending. Holy **** the ending made my blood boil, they just suddenly throw in Gore F*cking Magala into the mix as a teaser of a sequel that will never get made. F*ck you Paul, Gore Magala... really? The fact that they had Gore Magala just thrown in shows the lack of Monster Hunter knowledge. For those that don't know, there's a little thing called the Frenzy Virus that is caused by Gore Magala. It basically radiates this deadly fart dust that causes painful death that slowly kills those infected as they go mentally insane. This is always a sign **** Magala, always! In the lore, entire cities and towns were abandoned due to Gore Magala and his cooties. This film made me want to become an alcoholic so that I'd forget it's existence.

Thank you for listening to my 37 minute rant about why Paul WS Anderson is an assh*le. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I will enjoy this bottle of rum I bought to try and forget this film exists."

But somehow in cases more than often it turns our to be a failure (or close to a failure). Maybe it can be explained by the poor understanding of the world the filmmakers are trying to show, or its just the wish to adapt it to their own view... What they fail to understand - is that the uniqueness of those stories/games/books/animated films made them so popular. And that in order to make the adaptation no less popular - you need to somehow stick to that world you're showing there.

The movie itself looks as if the screenplay was prepared on the last day before filming. The dialogues sound dumb and childish, the scenes do not have any weight. We do not have any character explained here, nor do we have any idea what actually happened and what kind of world that is. We do not have any idea of what those Teams were looking for in the desert. We do not have any idea about the original mission. And finally - we do not have ANY idea about how the other (Monster) world works. Natasha just suddenly learns that her weapon has some extra feature (without prior explanation), she does not seem to care where she is and what is going on, and she somehow knows how to use a hand crossbow right from the start (although I doubt any US military ever used ANYTHING similar).

As for the ending - I do not even feel like talking about it - it is an absolute disregard towards the audience. Like saying ""We do not care about what is going on, or what is going to happen next. Never cared, actually... But here we wanna hint that You'll have another several **** parts of this movie in the future, so enjoy!"" It does not have any logic, we do not understand ""WHAT"" or ""WHY"". It just happens, out of the blue, so deal with it.

The quality of the CGI and overall picture is quite nice, though. It's a pity that they shoved such a horrible story and screenplay into such a beautiful wrapping. This idea had a nice potential for a good trilogy (or more), but the indifferent attitude of the filmmakers buried it for good..."

While the former consistently makes movies that are fluff, to his defense: they do make a profit. The latter does make acclaimed movies, but they are far less profitable. Paul was once asked a nicer version of: why do you make rubbish(while you can do better( see Mortal Kombat or Event Horizon))? He defended himself with a nicer packaged answer than this: rubbish is my trademark. And he does make a profit. I would wager that Monster Hunter will do too. Not in the democratic world where it gets panned for what it is: rubbish. But more in that countries were fluff is pushed as the daily drug: it is a movie that will slide through the censorships with such ease that you might think it was a lubricated and then slide down an ice sheet set at a right angle.  Unless the bureaucrats perceive something as a jab. Maybe the monsters are the government? No, No, that will not do! The follow up for Paul's answer could have been: it might be less rubbish if you let someone competent do the writing(see Mortal Kombat or Even Horizon.)  Seems that after having mauled the Resident Evil franchise with your lackluster attempts at writing you might have either learned to be better or to give up and let someone with writing skills in on the movie. But Paul just learned something else. What if there is no story at all? Paul has actually outdone himself with this one. If his previous movies were badly written, this movie is not written at all. Maybe even unwritten? The writing is not merely bad... it is not there. This is not even like the way Abrams handled the Rise of Skywalker: no story: just plot. This is like a twisted version of a Bay movie: no story, no plot: just explosions.


The incompetence of the writing is so avoidable that it baffles. One example suffices. The movie starts out with a bunch of generic American soldiers. They get introduced to us in a lackluster manner showing that they are in every way a cliché. Next they get killed of so quickly that you have to slow down the movie to see what happens to them. It is like snap: they are gone. Near the end of the movie we get introduced to another group of warriors. Perhaps it is better to say: made aware of. They look all diverse and interesting, but they are not introduced to us: they are just there. No names, nothing. Now compare this to the colonial marines in Aliens. We get introduced to a group of overconfident gung ho warriors that are all bluster, but as they go up against the aliens, they get more personality as the story unfold and they realize that they are in deep trouble.  This makes the audience feel it when they get killed. They are not stereotypes, but people. And even if you kill them off early in the movie, at least introduce the new group or just leave them out.


The writing is so not there. Milla's character is a blank sheet. The Asian warrior she meets is a blank sheet. Nobody has any kind of personality or any kind of character arc. They are not there.


And if you think: hey it is a monster movie.. that is what this is about.
Well, there are two monsters in this movie. And a bunch of creepy large spiders. And they are just that. Monsters that are there and indestructible. They basically take up most of the screen time to get killed. Not in a fascinating way. All the fancy weapons do nothing to them. Only a well aimed arrow can kill them. Yep. My take on this: this movie is aimed for China, where the money is to be made. The cliche American military gets wiped out at the start and end(when even tanks and helicopters get destroyed by da dragon) because hey: it is aimed for China, where this probably invokes giggles. Otherwise Paul avoided writing so it can get past the censors. If there is nothing there, it can't be banned.  Now Paul hopes it probably gets to be a franchise, just like transformers. And one wonders if **** up to China so you can get your movie past the censors becomes some kind of morally abject action? Ah well.

Le film est loin de l'univers du jeu et il y a beaucoup trop d'interprétation, les incohérences trop nombreuses, des cut scènes partout tout le temps, la musique qu'est ce qui c'est passé????, des deus machina qui montre clairement qu'ils voulaient pas s'embêtaient avec certaines explications et certaines scènes.
Ce qui est énervant c'est la gue-guerre entre les personnages qui sert à rien à part perdre du temps dans l'histoire et les éléments importants de l'univers de Monster Hunter. Et c'est là que tu comprends que le réalisateur ne doit pas connaitre le jeu ou alors si il le connait, n'a rien retenu ou n'en avait rien à faire.
Ne trouvant pas de solution pour expliquer certaines choses pourtant simple quand tu connais l'univers du jeu, le réalisateur fait du remplissage et parfois nous sort du deus machina pour clôturer une situation et ce qui amène parfois à du WTF.
Après je mettrais quand même un bon point sur l'humour.
Le jeu d'acteur bah c'est bien sans plus, même si par moment on a l'impression que les acteurs sont un peu paumés car ils jouent sur fond vert. On voit qu'ils cherchent un peu à se placer et les interactions avec le virtuel (vide) n'est pas très bien jouer.
Pour les effets spéciaux c'est beau, les paysages sont très bien rendu, il y a clairement eu le budget. Même si la post prod et encore passer par là pour foirer certaines scènes. Dommage.
Pour les dialogues c'est pas terrible, ça tourne en rond, ça parle pour rien dire, parfois ça n'a même ni queue ni tête et même à un moment vers le milieu du film ils disent carrément l'inverse de ce qu'ils avaient dit juste avant.
90% du film ce concentre sur l'histoire du personnage principal et voila. Euh et ce qui fait la licence? Le monde/univers MH? Les origines? pourquoi ce monde? pourquoi les chasseurs? les armes? l'ancienne civilisation? Pouvoir? la traque? la guilde? les monstres (espèces, variant, caractéristiques, spécificité, origine...)? etc... on en parle ou pas? bah quasi pas. Si vous cherchez à connaitre l'univers de MH passer votre chemin, par contre si vous voulez connaitre l'histoire d'un perso ça peut vous intéressez. C'est très autocentrer.
Ensuite la musique bon bah voila voila...
En gros un film d'action plutôt classique dans sa construction. On sent le film qui profite d'une licence pour faire parler de lui et donner un prétexte à faire un film gros budget. Malheureusement on tombe dans les travers classique du ""on fourni aucun scénar, aucun background, on concentre tout sur les personnages, la baston et la 3D"".
Dommage parce que la licence à vraiment du potentiel pour faire quelques chose de complet et offrir plusieurs possibilité de scénario en ce concentrant sur tel ou tel sujet du lore."

For whatever it takes - everything is done through the ass, except perhaps for the monster models. As far as I remember, the developers took out the director's brains to make the design of the monsters as close to the game as possible.
I would also like to plunge the soundtrack into the mud. There is no proof of a hero remix at all. The whole movie plays some kind of rip-off on daft punk. It feels like the technical task for the soundtrack was written like this:

The plot is literally no deeper than the simple synopsis you can read online. So little thought went into the writing that there isn't even a conclusion. The credits just start rolling in the middle of a big battle. You might think there's some kind of issue going on at your theater when they first pop up, but then the stinger hidden a few seconds in makes it clear that's actually where they decided to leave things. So don't expect any sort of resolution or explanation behind anything.

It also couldn't have gotten off on more wrong of a foot with me if it tried, as it quickly throws us in with a group of generic, cringe worthy tough guys and gals that embody the worst of military/soldier stereotypes. None of whom can act. Mercifully, the majority of them are killed off early on, leaving us with Milla Jovovich in the protagonist role as Cpt. Artemis and her costar Tony Jaa to carry the action forward. Unfortunately, both of them are portraying individuals so bland they might as well be actual avatars in a video game. There are no real characters to be found here. At least their chemistry is somewhat cute.

About the only thing I can praise in this whole mess outside of some silly humor and the adorable ""Meowscular Chef"" are the visuals. The film is legitimately stunning to look at. Particularly whenever it breaks away from the sterile desert environment. The monster CGI is so good that it even blows the latest Godzilla and Kong movies out of the water. It's clear the budget went here rather than the script.

This being a Paul W. S. Anderson film and given my enjoyment of his other works, I expected to have some nice things to say about the action as well. However, I ultimately found all of it to be a bunch of visual noise where each sequence and setpiece was designed to replace a plot, rather than serve one. As evident by the section where Jaa and Jovovich spend what feels like an eternity beating the crap out of each other rather than going ahead and teaming up to escape their predicament like we all know they're going to do anyways.

Without a plot to follow or heroes to invest in, Monster Hunter has been left with nothing but its good looks to fill that void and an 1h 45m running time. As pretty as it's sights are they prove not enough to get the job done. There actually needed to be something of substance here to back them up. The lack of any real, meaningful, or even entertaining content to be found left me with a genuine and inexplicable sense of embarrassment to have been in attendance despite being the only person other than the family member I brought with me in the theater at the time. If that's not good enough a reason to stay home and play one of the video games this is based on instead, I don't know what is.

The Battle of Midway was a turning point for the US’ involvement in World War 2, and proved to be a much-needed victory for the allied forces after the morale crushing attack on Pearl Harbour.

They cover Admiral Halsey getting sick prior to Midway, cover Admiral Spruance being put in charge of TF-16, and never mention once Admiral Fletcher (TF-17 / Yorktown) being in Tactical command of all American effort at Midway.

The film stars Ed Skrein as Lieutenant Richard Best, and his journey through this picture in becoming a daring pilot to save the Americans from the Japanese attack. Skrein is a good actor, whose had many different and successful roles, but here, his accent feels too fake and put-on, it also doesn't help that the dialogue, which was given to him by Wes Tooke, wants him to ham-up the cliched hero talk and over-exaggerate everything he says. He lives a rather peaceful life with his wife Anne (Mandy Moore) and daughter. The film is 2 hours and 18 minutes long, and I can definitely confirm that the pace of the film makes you feel every minute that goes by. There are so many characters here to focus on who don't get as many pivotal moments until the movie ends. We have Lieutenant Commander Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) who tries his best to figure out a way that the Americans can defeat Japan and prevent more lives at risk. The battle sequences are fine, but the main issue I took with this film is the very bright color palette. There is a lot of yellow here that is being emphasized on screen. The picture doesn't feel gritty or at least horrifying when you take into account what the characters have to go through here. Plus, the film is PG-13, which is the same mistake made with 'Pearl Harbor' (2001), there is no sense of horror or disturbance. Many of the deaths you see on screen won't stick with you, at least not in the way Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998) did. I understand it's unfair to compare 'Midway' or any other war film to 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), but if you want to make an effective war film, that's how it's done. Or at least, try to find other reasons why that worked. Overall, this is a forgettable movie filled with over-the-top and clustered action, some hammy acting and crummy dialogue. I think it's safe to say that the legacy of the people we see here will only be seen through the history books."

He tried for a tough guy;  kind of a cross between a wisecracking John Garfield with the look of a smirking James Dean.  And failed utterly.  The flight scenes were right out of video games, but the ones that don't bear any relation to the physics of flight.

The characters are all archetypes, and dont seem to be very realistic even though they are based on real life people. The script has no suspense or thrills- it seems more like a highlight reel of what happened on Pearl Harbor to the Battle of Midway. Even the Doolittle Raid takes up about five minutes- I think they included it because half the backers of this movie are Chinese. Let's not forget the cringe worthy dialogue too.

In fact, it seems to have taken very little from its predecessors in title. The script is banal: as it has happened in thousands of films before, a family with children moves to a new house, acquiring without knowing the (not very encouraging) possibility of being frightened by an endless series of ghosts. Of course, children will be the preferred target of these ghosts, be it by the ingenuity or the effect that this can provoke in the public. Nothing new here. Equally unoriginal (we've seen something similar in ""Insidious"" or ""The Conjuring""), the wardrobe in the girl's room is the most active place, eventually ""devouring"" one of the children. I will not talk more about what happens in this movie so I will not spoil. I just wanted to demonstrate that the film is a succession of cliches.

Gil Kenan's direction proved to be poor, fragile and did not seem to have been able to ask for the best of the actors and staff members. A lazy direction, which is content with the medium without pursuing excellence. The scares are scarce and predictable: objects that jump towards the display, snoring, scary noises and lights. I can say that I never felt truly frightened while watching the film. About the actors what can be said is that they seem to me to have tried to fulfill their role well, but they were not directed effectively. Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt fulfilled their roles, while the children (especially Kennedi Clements and Kyle Catlett) seem to have fully lived up to what was asked of them. Jared Harris and Jane Adams do not seem to have been good choices, a complete casting error.

This film is a far cry from the quality of the Poltergeist of the 1980s, and I do not know if it's honest to relate these films to this movie. This seems a bit too ambitious, even though they share the same name. Despite this, I have the feeling that it would have been better with a more creative script and a more demanding and skillful director."

The original is a contemporary classic that was groundbreaking for its time, and as long as you can ignore Beatrice Straight's gargantuan early '80s eyeglasses, it holds up well even today and never feels overly dated.

So I had little hope or much anticipation for this prospect. The trailer increased my curiosity level, though, and I allowed myself some excitement at the modernization possibilities, at the very least. Poltergeist with smart-phones, 24-hour TV and (hopefully) well-utilized CGI might possibly have potential, I thought. I was intrigued enough to postpone passing judgment prematurely. As Mickey and Mallory said, ""Well, let's give that key lime pie a day in court.""

That said, I was unprepared for just how bad this movie is, on so many levels. Poltergeist (2015) is dull, listless, unimaginative, devoid of style, charmless, pedestrian, slapdash and everything that's truly terrible about run-of-the-mill. From a creative standpoint, decisions were made which inexplicably ignored and/or subverted precise factors which made Poltergeist (1982) such a success. Detailed, authentic characters from the first movie -- a family that inspired audiences to root for and care about them -- are replaced here by a bland bunch of nondescript losers who barely merit attention.

Similarly, the spirit and sensibility of the original film has no echo here; tonally, this narrative is by-the-numbers, managing to somehow feel both too rushed and yawn-inducing simultaneously. Moreover, the evocative richness of the '82 version -- the house, the neighborhood, the entire milieu -- is now just a standard fare. The house is flat and featureless; the suburb itself feels neither sinister nor supernatural. In fact, nothing much in this movie feels like anything at all.

It's hard to fathom why such crucial elements have been handled so clumsily and, more to the point, why this ""reboot"" was realized with complete disregard for the very elements which made 1982's Poltergeist so enduringly iconic."

You need to change a lot about it, and not make viewers think that they're watching the original. Secondly, the actors just give up on acting. Sam Rockwell tries so hard, but his acting just doesn't work for the film. The wife can't even act, and the kids sound like they're reading the script for the first time. The directing is less than average, and I'm surprised a studio like 20th Century Fox would even supervise this film. Making the same film that came out 20 years ago, just with flat-screens, is not OK. Third, the film just isn't scary. I am always scared during horror films, but the only part I was scared at was the clown scene. Finally, you shouldn't waste your money on this film.

This movie has no character development, no plot development, no suspense, no atmosphere, no tension, and there is no stakes as to what is happening to these cardboard characters.
The modernization of this film only makes it harder to watch. When they used a god forsaken drone as one of the central plot-points, I contemplated walking out of the theatre. This movie has no reason to be shown in 3D, and when the 3D is actually utilized, it's obnoxious.

It's a shame, because the movie has a competent cast. But even with that, Saxon Sharbino, Rosemarie Dewitt and Jane Adams are the only cast members who have any of the charisma that the original film's cast had.

To put it in short, Poltergeist is a watered down, rushed and incompetent retelling of a much better film. The only updates to the story the film has are useless, and don't change enough from the original to be surprising to older audiences. The cast is fine, but the writing, the directing and the execution don't hold a candle to the original film. Even as a standalone story, the movie is a poorly directed and written ghost story, that will leave no impact on the viewer due to it's lack of character development, lack of suspenseful scenes, and lack of anything of substance. This remake blends into the crowd of current jumpscare heavy ghost films and will assuredly be forgotten very soon. Which is probably for the best."

3327,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/poltergeist/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,ReysonPoint,"Jun 7, 2015",3,"The 2015 Reboot of Poltergeist is a great example of why some movies are better to be left alone. Especially when it’s a great one, such as the 1982 original horror classic, Poltergeist directed by Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and produced by the iconic Steven Spielberg (Jurassic Park, Jaws, Indian Jones).

The original film had great characters, great filmmaking, and most importantly great scares. Pretty much all the things the things that this reboot did not have.

Now, the first part of this film is the introduction of the Bowen family.  Once they set the stage for the family, we quickly learned how the father, played by actor Sam Rockwell (The Way Way Back, Moon, Iron Man 2) was laid off from his old job, forcing the family to move to a new house. As the film develops we learned how both parents are unemployed and struggling financially. We have the mom played by actress Rosemarie Dewitt (Your Sister’s Sister, Promised Land) who is a frustrated writer and then we have her three kids. The oldest is Kendra Bowen played by Saxon Sharbino (Touch, Julia X) who plays the cliché rebellious daughter, the second character Griffin Bowen, is played by Kyle Catlett (The Following) who is the middle child that no one believes, and is always scared, and then we have the youngest, Madison Bowen played by Kennedi Clements (Jingle all the Way 2) who talks to her imaginary friend and eventually gets abducted by the evil ghosts.  The acting in this film was one of the worst things of the entire film. I would even go as far as to say that Saxon Sharbino was one of the most annoying characters of the entire year. Every line that came out of her mouth, made me want to leave the theater. Then, we have Kennedi Clements who plays the little girl who gets abducted. She came across as annoying and unpleasant. This was definitely one character that was better in the original. Heather O’Rourke played the original character and she was also one of the best parts of the original film that gave the audience a charming performance.

Aside from the characters, let’s talk about the movie as a whole. This is a film that should’ve never gotten a reboot and what they did here just did not work. Director Gil Kenan (City of Ember, Monster House) tried to make the same film that Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper made in 1982, but instead he made a movie that was unable to scare or connect with the audience.  The script for this film had countless problems and moments of me rolling my eyes due to how stupid it made everyone sound.  Then, we have multiple iconic scenes that were so well done and that scared audiences in the original that this time around, simply lacked emotion, horror, and consisted of too much CGI.

In conclusion this brand new take on Poltergeist simply did not do anything for me. This was a movie that had me checking my watch over and over and wanting the film to be over. In my eyes the original Poltergeist is the only Poltergeist. This is simply a forgettable flick and with that said, this is one of the worst movies so far, of the year.

What comes to mind watching this movie is a lame attempt from the early 2000's to try out something new before superhero movies were big.  But now superhero movies have been taken seriously for over a decade and there's no excuse for this kind of bad writing.

It starts out interesting enough but soon delves into a snorefest.  The first half of the movie I feel like Max is constantly running from something. STOP RUNNING AND DO SOMETHING INTERESTING, DAMN IT. When agents are chasing him there's nothing interesting to it. No badass fights...just Max doing what he does best, running. The first real fight he has is with a wind-like creature and like everything else, is uneventful. He does an energy blast to take it down and that's it. The fight seems very pointless and even by the end of the movie it has you scratching your head. The second fight is the last and with the main villain.  This fight is also uneventful where nothing cool happens. Most of it is the villain monologuing. When a villain has to explain the movie to you in one of the last scenes it shows how lazy the writers are. Don't have a character explain it all to me at the end, show me the story throughout the movie. Make me care about the villain and his motives, don't just vomit the point during the last fight. Give them interesting dialogue instead. Some other points:
I'm not sure what tone they were going for. It seemed to have a semi-serious tone but when Steel shows up the tone changes to a corny comedy. If it was going to be a corny comedy it should have started out as such. When Steel shows up Max's mom shouts from downstairs, ""dinner is ready"" (or something along those lines) but she can't hear Max when he's yelling and breaking stuff because he's freaked out when Steel appears? Also, nobody in the film seems to notice Steel. When Max keeps him in his backpack, Steel will be talking and Max can hear him but nobody else seems to really notice.  It's supposed to be for comedic relief  but it doesn't work if it doesn't make sense. The whole movie screams of crappy lazy writing.
Why did Max get his powers when they moved to that specific place? I don't think it was explained in the movie. The movie would have been so much better if it focused less on story and just tried to be a fun action-packed beat em up superhero movie. The story was so boring, didn't make sense, so obviously lazy, and devoid of any good action. They should have given just a little bit of story (that made sense) and made Max into a badass instead. Wrecking the day of the agents, having cool boss battles, etc.  Even if it ended up being mediocre it would have been a fun afternoon watch.

There's a lot more that's wrong with the movie but this is the stuff that comes to mind right now."

Perhaps I should start with the mindset of the people on set. Word is that they wanted this movie to be PG, but they lost the appeal. Perhaps if they cut out the image of someone pulling out a piece of glass from their leg, maybe this movie would have been PG-rated. While I painfully go through this review, keep in mind that these are the people we're dealing with. Their thought process appears to be topsy-turvy.
Max Steel is the thankfully ill-fated adaptation of a line of action figure toys brought to us by Mattel, and if I had to sum up the plot, I would point to Transformers (2007), saying that the two movie have a rather similar plot (not the same, but somewhat similar). Good grief, this movie is cinematic cyanide through and through.
The plotline is continually stupid, followed by the cinematography, which is even worse (especially during one particular scene where the camera couldn't stop cutting from one place to another every 10 or so seconds). The characters are not only bland, but inert and completely weak. Yet, the movie expects me to like a romance between two characters that proves to be even more bland, formulaic, and stupid. These issues are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the problems with this sci-fi time-waster.

I won't slate the acting like alot of people, they were all fine I guess, but one thing that truelly annoyed me was the terrible shotgun sound effect.

Another problem results from its Latino cast, which gets the opportunity to be the lead characters and unfortunately re-nurtures the idea that in the Latino community everyone is either a gardener, a gang member or a cartel member.

The Tax Collector doesn't contribute anything relevant or exciting and is perhaps David Ayer's most disappointing work to date.

One actor (Jesse Metcalfe) even has his own Television show (Dallas) on network TV for crying out loud. The court cases listed in the credits have nothing to do with Christians being persecuted, but have everything to do with Christians doing the persecution. As for the choices made in the story, why on god's green Earth would a teacher need a public defender to defend her in a civil court? And why on great Zeus' Olympus would a teacher be in trouble for uttering the name Jesus? The court cases that have been mentioned in the end credits were examples of Christians doing the persecuting. The real message of the 'God's not Dead' franchise, I believe is this: ""If you don't allow me to persecute you, then you are persecuting me.""

This and the previous instalment of the 'God's not Dead' franchise is trying too hard to get people to believe in Christianity. It's like a sales representative trying too hard to convince a customer to get an extended warranty even after the customer repeatedly says no.

Believe it or not, there is going to be a third 'God's not Dead' instalment coming out sometime this year, and god forbid, we're going to see the same persecution mentality.

To be completely honest with you, this film and Christian films like this, do not resonate in any positive way, shape or form."

Unfortunately it's still horribly boring and false. Like the first one, it is purely a fictitious plot without precedent - don't let messages in the film itself deceive you otherwise - and serves as a straw man to demonize enemies of the Family Research Council.

These enemies, whose vendettas with Christianity can be neatly summed up as, ""First World problems"" compared to any actual religious persecution that occurs today, include the ACLU, who form the antagonists of this film. Yes, a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union, those ""evil"" guys who desegregated American education and are currently fighting against targeted assassinations of American citizens without trial, are represented by Ray Wise, an actor who has portrayed Satan in recent history, as the prosecution.

Other enemies of the Family Research Council were tackled in the previous entry: atheists, the educational elite (those NERDS!!), Muslims, and Confucianists. They are all enemies for pretty much the same reasons, which include but are not limited to: racism, anti-intellectualism, respecting your parents more than your religious leaders, being susceptible to extending civil rights to traditionally unprivileged sexualities and genders, and ancient feuds that modern Christians don't really understand.

For example: Christian and Muslim rivalry began when the Papal theocracies of the middle ages tried and failed to expel Muslim people permanently from the so-called ""Holy Land."" In response to mild - even milder than the Middle East today - mistreatment, Christians became responsible for the first ever documented (i.e. recorded) case of human cannibalism during the Siege of Ma'arra in what is modern day Syria. As if the killing and digestion of women and children were not hypocritical enough, Christians continue this proud tradition of hypocrisy today by producing propaganda for the silver screen. This is because they are no longer formally backed by an entire continent of career warriors and are a bit more sheepish about their sociopathy now. For that matter, this is also true of pretty much any modern religion, though I'm sure the militant Islamic sects would pretend otherwise.

I prefer it much better this way. Clearly no one is being convinced by these films; it is purely fodder for Christians to confirm their biases in the way they are familiar with: unprecedented parable.

Feel free to actually look up the court cases listed in the credits. You will find that there is nothing approaching the antipathy toward Christians in any of them, no matter how much the Family Research Council pretends.

Since I was doing a service to the producers of the film by seeing it, I did not pay anything to watch it. You're welcome, Harold Cronk and David A.R. White. I would advise the reader of this review against a similar service, though. Spend those two hours exercising, fixing up the house, or working at the food bank.

You want CLOSEUPS? Every actor's face is so tightly framed, it's exhausting to watch. Sheesh! At least 3/4 of the movie is facial closeups.

Overall, a harsh, angry tone pervaded the film. I walked out of the theater feeling ready to rip **** apart, rather than feeling blessed and filled with the Holy Spirit (I think 2015's War Room did better on that account). I agree with Consequence of Sound reviewer who wrote that the scene in the church by the Martin character playing Nearer My God to Thee was the most hearfelt true scene (see this: ****/2016/04/film-review-gods-not-dead-2/

This is one of the biggest atrocities I have come across in recent history. this might just be Rob Schneider's lowest point.

The CG is laughably bad by 2016 standards. Imagine Zootopia, but bland, generic and uninspired. As for the jokes, imagine Flame Hyneard from Mega Man X7, but more obnoxious and annoying. ESPECIALLY THOSE DAMN LEMMINGS. I just wish they would act like REAL lemmings and walk off a cliff. Piss jokes, fart jokes and other types of raunchy, uninspired humor come from these hairy testicles. Also, the story is as weak as a half-assed Twilight remake written by Hannah Montannah Essentially, some guy wants to build houses in the north pole for cash, but some polar bear named Norm attempts to stop him and Norm is also the only bear in the north that can speak to humans... for some reason. And he can also dance... for some reaso- WHAT IS GOING ON?!

This film should burn... BURN IN HELL. Do not allow your child to watch it. No matter how many times they beg and whine and scream and tantrum for the DVD or Blu-Ray, DO NOT GIVE THESE DIRECTORS ANY MONEY.

Surely my review would annoy those who liked it. But the majority of who saw it was felt just like me. It has been 20 years since the first 3D animated feature film came. Not all the films released in this period were great. Some were technically sounded good and some were stories. If you had seen 'Hoodwinked!', you would know how awesome that story was, despite the poor animation production. But this film failed in all the department.

I recently finished watching the first season of 'Trollhunters' and 'Miraculous Ladybug'. Even the television made products were much better than this film. Small budget, small production house et cetera is not an excuse. Thankfully, this is not the only bad animated feature I've seen so far in my life, but sadly it joins the list of those titles.

Maybe! The little kids could enjoy it, who does not know to differentiate between good and bad. But for the adults, this is definitely skippable film. The best thing about this film was the message it carried, though, even for an animated film and a fantasy film, not convincing enough. It was kind of very similar to 'Delhi Safari'. In some perspective, I thought it was a remake of that. There are lots of other films similar to this like 'Chole & Theo', 'Happy Feet' and so on that you can try them instead.

The Film had no understandable flow, and lacks even one moment of thought provoking action. The film as a whole is fairly unfunny, though has moments of comical relief that kind of surprised me. I actually really like the character of Norm, who I felt had the best arc throughout and the best voice work, and his companions, the most untelligable characters in this film, easily offer the most laughs. The plot, however, makes no sense and most of the film tries to feel like it lives in the 21st Century, but is reduced to childish jokes. And in comparison to other animated offers of the year such as Zootopia, Kubo and the Two Strings, and even the slightly overrated The Secret Life of Pets, Norm of the North lacks any depth or even principles in its animation design. In grading the film as it was meant to be presented, a children's film, it works perfect for young kids and is sure to keep them entertained. But to anyone who is over the age of about 9, this is just a bad movie. My 3/10 comes from the fact I really enjoyed the character of Norm and his companions the lemmings made he laugh."

When the makers of this film finished it, who looked at this and thought it was ok to release to theaters?! Norm of the North may be entertaining to those who like watching twerking polar bears, but if you're not, do NOT watch this movie. The animation makes it look like something you'd see in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart. The humor isn't even stupidly funny, it's just plain dumb. The plot is paper thin, and the characters are non-existent! Also, can we assess the fact that the star of this movie is Rob Schneider? I'm sure he's a nice guy and all, but out of all of the potential voice actors you've could of gotten, you drag Rob Schneider into the mix. I just... I just can't. This movie is by far the worst animated film i've seen in a theater, and don't give me the argument that it's a kid's movie, and that it'll only entertain kids. When I went and saw this movie, the kids in my theater were bored out of their minds, and when I saw one family walk in, after 20-30 minutes, they left the theater and didn't come back! Seriously, when not even kids can enjoy your film, you've clearly done something wrong. Do not waste your time on this god-awful atrocity.

Unlike a cheesy fun disaster movie like Armageddon or 2012, Geostorms serious tone doesn't suit the cheesy fun set pieces. Armageddon was fun with plenty of cheese but that felt right in that movie because it didn't take itself too seriously and had comedy elements. Geostorm is super serious in its delivery and would have been less rubbish if it had stayed grounded and intelligent like Deep Impact or Twister instead of going wild with the plot and over the top scenarios. The acting is alright just bland characters with dull dialogue. The parts that made me go from disliking this to hating it was the nonsense Science, the cringe action scenes and the stupid twist halfway through. The science in this movie doesn't make sense and logic is out the window. If you like science you will hate this film. The action is mindless and cringy. During the action you end up internally saying ""Yeah right, like that would happen"" because what you see is something ridiculous happening in a dead serious all be it bad movie. The twist of who done it and why that happens is so stupid and face palming bad, I laughed out loud. Worst big budget disaster movie to date, Sharknado of the big screen !"

The solution to a problem is literally super handy and within easy reach, building no tension. Everyone is convinceable. The bad guy is a stereotype pur sang. The actors seem to have no idea what direction they want to go on and their well-tried efforts did not come out well from the editing room. It's so ridiculously edited, at one point they try to portrey 4 global disasters going one, while also telling a story down on Earth and one on the space ship.

In fact, there is stiff competition for the film's internal stupidity award. At first you think that the ludicrous ""science"" the movie seems to take seriously will run away with the win. But then you notice the atrocious ""acting"" and hammy dialog, and the race is back on. But to the astute viewer a dark horse should appear at some point in the appallingly inaccurate portrayal of American politics and the kind of swine who are now the only ones who could possibly become American presidents. If we're lucky he's a mindless party hack. If not, a crazed ideologue bent on world war. But, lo and behold and extreme sphincter contracting shock, the president is a hero in Geostorm. Who would have thunk it? Hollywood never does that angle to death, right? But this is not all, lest you are still not convinced. Cars explode as if they are not just loaded with explosives but actually built from them. Pompous music blares loudly over everything, because otherwise us poor peasants wouldn't know how to feel about things, there is a tacked on family intrigue as if people who build space stations and work in governments are real people instead of soulless sociopaths. There is even an unrealistic ninja woman, exactly like in The Matrix, except not good. And guns have unlimited ammunition. Hooray! And sprinkled on top are all the movie cliches in the world, from the main characters appear to die but are ""surprisingly"" hiding off camera to surprise the villain cliche to the blase banter that all Hollywood couples for some reason engage in, but which never actually happens in the real world cliche. And everything in between obviously: Door stops bullets cliche, the patriotic self sacrifice cliche, heroic president cliche as I mentioned, driving backwards while shooting a handgun at a pursuing vehicle cliche, speaking in code to fool the evildoers cliche, etc, etc ,etc. Trust me, it's jam packed with all the cliches you could possibly think of. I gave up counting due to extreme lack of interest at around 40. And they are not subtle either. They are completely over the top, with cue music for the dullards watching, as if things weren't already super obvious enough. GAAH!

I'm sorry, but I'm burned out now. There are just so many idiotic things about Geostorm that I have a headache from trying to remember all of them. And not only that, but it is more globalist propaganda, evidently aimed at the lowest common denominator, to put it politely. The people who made this movie, whose names I refuse to remember, and for that matter anyone who takes any part of it seriously in any way, should be shot out into space themselves as a matter of public sanitation.

Cars hit a slope and tilt, while the wheels won't swerve (which would immediately disappoint everyone expecting their rollercoaster ride, boo). People will spontaneously not combust, but freeze faster than it is possible on the Kelvin scale. Gerard Butler hits a new low point of his career which is around the third time he surpasses any expectations, while faceplanting steel and glass for a length of 50 meters while nothing happens to him or his suit made largely out of canvas.

Now,this isn't,like,another The Emoji Movie,but it's DEFINITELY not something i would spend my 10 bucks (or 20 bucks in IMAX) on. And,all honesty said here,i was actually excited for this movie,and now that i saw it,i can fairly say that 'Geostorm' is just another movie at the same level of the Transformers movies,where we wanted the action all over the flick,but we're just greeted with tons (and i mean TONS) of boring plot and subplot sequences. The story may be bland,sure,but it gets lazy and lazy throughout the movie and SPOILER ALERT (or not),the action sequences in the movie are the action sequences that fill the trailer to fool you once again into spending money,with the first action sequence (1 minute and 40-something seconds) of action dropping after 20 minutes of movie. I will only save the first minutes of the movie,since the beginning sequence is stylish with its story,and tells you about this somewhat interesting concept. During the story,expect some scenes that rip-off better movies,like Interstellar or Gravity (2013). Usually in a good or bad action movie,the special effects are something i always tend to save,but in here it SURE does lack the feel of an actual computer-effect. For example,there's a scene a-la San Andreas where a flood is taking over San Francisco and its Golden Gate bridge,but when it gets into the bridge,it's not being destroyed by the flood like if the bridge is an indestructible bridge. If 2012 (Roland Emmerich) scared the shoot out of me with its effects,i would laugh-out-loud with Geostorm's special effects. And what can i say about the acting? Well,let's say that Gerald Butler is just there because he needs a paycheck,as well as Ed Harris (?!?!?) and others. The music (by The LEGO Batman Movie's Lorne Balfe) can get...well,""iffy"" at times,even if it's tolerable nontheless. In the end,Geostorm is just as great as an actual end of the world internet hoax. Don't expect some 2012 or Independence Day level of awesomness,because this movie is the opposite of what you'll expect.

Geostorm is exactly what is advertises only worse. All you’re expecting is something that’s so bad it’s good. That’s the only thing these kind of movies have going for them. I mean I’m not going to criticise the script, the acting and the plot, it’s not about that. It’s about entertainment value but Geostorm is a fail of epic proportions. You had one job and you couldn’t even do that right. So what is wrong with it? Well the lack of the actual Geostorm for one thing. All the catastrophic weather disasters are all featured in the trailer and the movie itself adds little else. Most of Geostorm is hacking, more hacking, arguing, hacking in space and a kidnapped President. We also get people outrunning tsunamis and extreme frost. All things you’ve seen before only better.

3500,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,AndrewBurge,"May 3, 2018",0,"Let me just get this out of the way first: I have no problem with offensive humor. As long as something which aims to be funny is funny, it means it has served its purpose. The offensiveness is almost always worth it. On that note, Dan Mazer's 'Dirty Grandpa' manages to be offensive without being funny. Seriously, there are barely any jokes here which land. The best of which being one involving a scatophilic fantasy by retired Army veteran **** Kelly (Robert De Niro) involving Queen Latifah and a hot air balloon, but only because De Niro used every single of his acting chops to deliver it as wacky and sudden as possible.

Alas, though! Not ever double Oscar winner Robert De Niro can save this sick and disgusting mess. It seems that writer John Phillips has the philosophy that as long as something is offensive, it has to be funny. But, of course! We love laughing at a drawing of a **** swastika shown to a rabbi, or mindless and absurd drug consumption or even accidental child pornography! We are a bunch of sick pervs! We do not require any attempt at trying to control this controversial scenes through humor. I mean, hey - its offensive so its gotta be funny. Right?

And this is not even the worst part! What really makes this film implode upon itself is the failure of its director of getting the best out of scenes which could have intelligent humor potential. One such example is when well-cut and straight as an arrow lawyer Jason Kelly (Zac Efron) ends up in jail after being led into drug consumption. He starts a conversation with the local police guards about human rights and law all while the two policemen mock him all while favoring the local drug dealer. But this scene progressively gets worse and worse and instead of dropping out of it, director Mazer keeps pushing transforming it into senseless, illogical and, at times, even disturbing gibberish.

To be honest, at the start, this looked like a pretty mediocre film. But close to the end, it gets messy and straight-up racist making a mockery of the African-American culture's use of the N-word, among others. It is offensive but not funny, aims to give family principles but ends up pairing an old retiree with a teenage girl and worst, is De Niro's worst screen choice yet... God knows we need 'The Irishman' now more than ever."

There's really not an underuse of characters, but the overuse of a few characters and the 'idiot cop gag' lead to gaps in the film being completely laugh free. Audrey Plaza, Zac Efron, and Robert De Niro all give wacky, completely unrealistic character performances and deliver lines with the attempt to create belly laughs, but John M Phillips writing services them nothing interesting to say. The most problematic issue was the over-the-top drama towards the end of the film that felt incredibly forced and unnatural. Overall, each actor in this 'comedy' deserves the respect that none of their performances felt like this film was just another pay check for them. Plus the editing and cinematography is well done for the most part. Dirty Grandpa, however, is just too unfunny to be considered even a decent comedy, since very little of the dialogue and visuals provide much more than uncomfortable chuckles."

Basically it boils down to an old widowed ""grandpa"" who just wants to do all the ""dirty"" stuff he could not do while he was faithfully married to grandma. If you sit back and do not take anything too seriously - as in plot line or script - it is very funny from beginning to **** grandpa relives a frat party kinda way! 9 for acting - especially from Deniro, 7 for script and 5 for the predictable plot line...

The movie is a great way to escape into 90 minutes of a ridiculously raunchy funny ""dirty grandpa"" leading his buttoned up grandson from one obscenely raunchy scene to another. What made it work for me was Deniro! He is a veteran genius actor who - no matter what movie he is in - can still carry any scene or movie he wants! Considering the plot line and script was predictable Efron and Deniro played well off each other as the movie jumped from one ridiculous scene to another.

In the end it is a great movie to just sit back drink a beer or two and laugh without expecting much more other than funny acting from Deniro. 90 minutes of grandpa acting and talking like a dirty old man - while his grandson trys to understand what the heck is wrong with my grandpa! I laughed from beginning to end and at least in the past most raunchy frat style movies - ranging from Porky's to Bad Grandpa - made me laugh far less.

La historia inicia con el funeral de la abuela de Jason (Zack Efron), donde él se presenta como un joven recto con grandes aspiraciones, a punto de casarse e iniciar su vida laboral en la firma de abogados de su padre. Todo cambia cuando aparece **** (Robert De Niro), su abuelo, quien le pide que postergue su itinerario para acompañarlo en un pequeño viaje para hacer honor a la difunta.
Las expectativas comienzan a caer en picada tras la siguiente escena, donde devela la corriente humorística que utilizará durante la siguiente hora. Escenas vulgares, hacer objeto de las mujeres, bromas fálicas y personajes estúpidos e incoherentes son las cartas que utiliza para entretener, y está bien si eso te divierte, pero comparándolo con otras comedias este film ni siquiera intenta hacer algo distinto o nuevo.
El elenco no sobresale, De Niro solo cumple con su rol y Efron como positivo tiene una escena donde canta. Los actores secundarios son olvidables, sus personajes carecen de profundidad o carisma, solo sirven para dar pista a los remates de los protagonistas.

First i will start with the few bright spots of this movie. The bright spot is Robert De Niro. The film the story the jokes were terabille but he was good in this movie. I just can't understand why is he picking so many bad projects. The other one was Zac Efron he was good in this movie too and the chemistry between them were great. But the rest of this movie is just pure garbage. The directing was horrible scenes where constructed so poorly and transitions between them where so unbelievable horrible the tone was pure garbage too. The script was abhorrent. It is one of the worst script's ever. Characters are written awfuly. The story is non existent, motivations are a joke, the dialog is hideous it is honestly disgusting. The joke's where so bad they were so dreadful. I hated the jokes so much. because they went for shock value and they achieved it i was shoked i wasn't laughing tho i was disgusted.n this whole movie there is only one decent scene and that's after credits scene that i smiled And thats it this movie just wasn't funny at all."
3511,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,LeZee,"Jun 4, 2016",3,"The usual, nothing innovative about it!

Everything I wrote was just my personal opinion, definitely not intended to offend anybody. This should have been one of the best comedies of the year, but now it belongs to one of the worst. I recommend 'Grandma' instead this which I felt a much better comedy.

At this age, Robert De Niro was unbelievably awesome, though his character needed a good support from another and that's where as usual Zac failed to deliver his part. I would have preferred someone like Taylor Lautner who's desperate for a breakthrough than the Zac who ruins always.

The screenplay was from the 'blacklist', knowing this they should have been more careful while casting for it. The story was okay, because it was not meant for one of the greatest films of all time. It was sort of a weekend getaway or the bachelor party theme, but the film gives its original reason and then those developed plots were too familiar if you have seen plenty of teen films, in the party theme.

It's supposed to make us laugh, but there are lots of outdated humours tried in the unusual route to narrate them. The grandfather-grandson combo was an excellent idea, the main plot revolves around them and it should have remained that way, but the undetermined romance was an interruption. Or they should have developed a decent romance track for a better balance in the genre.

At least it would have been all right if it was a teen film. Many of those who appeared in it were actually too old to represent the roles given to them. That's fine too, because films are fake, everything is make-up and performance, but none were at their best except De Niro and Aubrey Plaza. It is definitely a film to skip, that's my opinion, but they're a few who are defending it, so be careful that I'm not always right and they're not always wrong if you want to choose it.

I found it to be more awkward and stupid than hilarious. The writing is beyond awful, and the characters are so one-dimensional they might as well have put paper cutouts of Zac Efron and Robert Deniro on camera.

The movie does have moments of tenderness between the two main characters and for the most part Efron and DeNiro are rather convincing, however those short moments of character depth are completely drowned out by the constant flow of forced innuendo and vulgar dialog that completely misses the mark in delivering any humour. Having an old man facing the concept of mortality and his workoholic grandson who has forgotten how to enjoy life could have been rather interesting. An interesting dynamic that the movie only suddenly cares about showing in the third act, which is simply to little too late and falls flat.

Both DeNiro and Effron star in the new rude, crude, and obscene film 'Dirty Grandpa'. We are ‘treated' to seeing Robert DeNiro (as perverted frisky and unsexed Grandpa **** Kelly - get it?) **** to an interracial pornography video the day after the funeral of his wife who he was with for 40 years. We also get to see Effron's (James Kelly) brother pouring beer over his dead grandmother’s coffin, Effron wearing a bee thong with his arse out in the open (several times), which at one point comes off causing him to expose himself to a little boy, while simulation with the assumption of oral sex between the two (I’m not kidding here) and an endless, and I mean endless, supply of **** jokes, and **** (one scene has Effron and DeNiro sharing a bed together in which DeNiro sleeps naked, and the next moment there is a **** in his face supposedly to be Grandpa's). This is not to mention scenes of Effron in jail with a fellow cellmate feeling him up, the one gay character in the movie being made fun of because he is gay, two inept police officers who all but ignore the town’s drug dealer (Adam Pally) who happens to shoot guns in his tourist a/k/a drug shop, and an extremely horny young woman (Zoey Deutch) who has way too much sex talk with DeNiro. It all adds up to one dirty, and bad movie. The plot is this: after the death of his wife, Grandpa Kelly wants to head down to his condo in Florida, so he tricks grandson Jason into driving him down there, much to the dismay of Jason’s fiance Meredith (Julianne Hough), who’s he about to marry and with the wedding rehearsal just days away. On the way Grandpa and Grandson run into Grandson’s ex-schoolmate Lenore (Aubrey Plaza), with the aforementioned horny Shadia (Deutch) and the gay camp Tyrone (Brandon Mychal Smith) in tow. Shadia’s got the hot hots for Grandpa (to tick one of her ‘must do’ boxes) and Lenore will realize that she’s got the hots for Jason. It’s a road trip that ends in most of the character’s lives changed, as well as the audiences.

Know this isn’t just a dumb comedy that is still a funny film, this film is rarely ever funny. Bad Grandpa is racist, so dumb it’s amazing, and not very funny. The worst part of this film is seeing the great Robert De Niro, who is one of the all-time greats, in such a terrible film.
The script is so bad that it’s worth wondering what the screenwriter was going for. One of the biggest problems the film has is it’s racist and mean-spirited humor, which is instigated by De Niro’s character. On top of that their is no character development, so just about every character is a stereotype or a cliche, the worst of which is Aubrey Plaza’s character. It may seem odd to say, but the racism is just the tip of the iceberg with this film.
The element that is truly mind boggling is how dumb Dirty Grandpa is, it is so dumb that the screenwriter had to have some kind of a purpose, it’s just not clear what that is. There is one character in the film Pam, played by Jason Mantzoukas, who brings the film down like a smelly kid at the playground. Every gag involving the Pam character is just plain stupid, so stupid it can’t be taken serious, and drags the film down. It’s the flat supporting characters that make the film so dumb, and even condescending because they clearly show that the writers think the audience can’t figure out a simple joke.
On top of the sheer stupidity, and the racism Dirty Grandpa isn’t very funny, maybe except a 13 year old boy who is laughing more because he feels like he shouldn’t be watching the film than at the humor of the jokes. De Niro and Efron have little comedic chemistry, and they are the only characters to offer any genuine humor, the supporting characters just bumble around like idiots as the plotless film trucks along. From a story standpoint the film is bad in just about every aspect, except that it’s not too hard to follow.
When you consider De Niro’s comedic talent, showcased in Meet the Parents and Analyze This, and Efron’s talent it’s a showcase of wasted talent. The film is plotless, racist, dumb, silly, poorly-acted, poorly-paced, cliched, and filled with flat characters. Dirty Grandpa’s biggest problem is most likely that it was lazily made, but watching it, it feels like the filmmakers had to know and went beyond not caring.

Perhaps often is an understatement. But with 211 Cage surprises again by putting in a such a run-of-the-mill performance that one can only giggle.. and giggle and giggle some more.

Cage is in good company(or is that bad?) as the rest of the cast is as bland as used teabags.  There is kind of attempt to make us care for them as the various non-entities get introduced during the long winded first part of the movie, but it doesn't pay off when it should.

It makes me pause to consider what makes us connect to **** feel the hurt they feel. Or at least sympathize. Using tropes like: man-hears-he-becomes-a-father-just-before-facing-mortal-peril puts me off. Come on! And of course he doesn't die. It isn't even a spoiler to say so.. it is that kind of movie.(It would at least have been inspired if she wasn't pregnant as he turns out to be infertile. Or she ups and leaves. You know, like real life people sometimes do).

The movie tries to take the serious angle by declaring to be inspired by real life events, but it is just that: inspired, not based on. If they would have based it on the North Hollywood Shootout(which is the one they mean), they would have altered the movie significantly. For one, there was never a pause. The two dudes(not four) came out and the fight was on: what you would call a running battle. There were also no hostages. But the movie has the robbers sit inside the bank for some time with hostages, so where the heck is the negotiator? And why show the police as having AR-15 as the lack of them was the whole point in the real shootout: that the police did not have the necessary firepower to stop the heavily armed and armored robbers?(It is just infuriating when you watch an interview with a former LAPD Swat team member who explains just that and why it can not happen now and this movie gets exactly this point wrong).

Then the Swat team does arrive - which takes ages unlike with the real shootout -, they get time to set up the assault and do so is a very clumsy way. As said: there is no negotiator but there are also no snipers and the teams only use what must be a smoke grenade. And why they heck do they press the assault when the hostages are send out?

But possibly the worst part of the movie is the utter unrealistic carelessness for human suffering with the cops. When the backup arrives with their AR-15's, they waist no time to shower the bank with a hail of bullets while it is obvious that they have hostages in there and it is very likely they hit them first. In addition they leave one of the survivors of the coffee cup bombing unattended while it is clear she is in a terrible state. And finally they don't give a rats ass that Cage has an obvious nervous breakdown after being on the receiving end of a barrage of bullets and thinking his son-in-law has died. But the only thing the officer in charge does is telling him to calm down. It is almost like the slap-in-the-face trope, without the slap in the face. But anyway, in this movie it works as Cage then takes charge and goes Rambo.

There is an utter lack of seriousness in the whole movie that tries to pawn itself off as being serious. And there lies the issue. There is so much unrealism in this movie(a band of experienced mercenaries robbing a bank for a trifle?) that the whole inspiration becomes silly. If this is inspired by real life events, then Lord of the Rings is inspired by the First World War, Star wars by the American revolution, and Pearl Harbor by Pearl Harbor(and one of these might actually be true). It would have been better if they had not taken this all too serious, but just made a stupid action flick with an over the top bad/good guy. Cage can do that. That is his thing.

This is another Netflix dud. Netflix Orginal is becoming a byword for underperforming. Netflix: get a hold of yourself. Merit"

The fact is that Cage is one of the most active stars in Hollywood, willing to take on any role, and there in lies the problem. His most recent film, 211, may be one of the most pointless and uninteresting action films ever made. Four mercenaries who are looking to get back at their corrupt boss, start robbing banks where he keeps his money. This leads them to the small town of Chesterfield, where a job is interrupted by the police, leading to a stand-off. Cage stars as Mike Chandler, an officer nearing his retirement, saddled with his son-in-law as a partner. What made 211 so bad is that the stand-off and shoot outs take over the majority of the time and Dog Day Afternoon, this film is not. Aside from the occasional expletives, there are long shoot out sequences with no dialogue. When the action cools down and people finally do speak, it's actually worse, because then the lack of experience and talent of the supporting cast is painfully evident. Action movies are supposed to be exciting and get the blood pumping, even if the story isn't all that great, it's something the genre has lived on since the 1970s, but 211 is an action filmed that bored me. When one is watching an action film and nodding off, it is an indicator that something is seriously wrong with that film. I do love Nicholas Cage, but this movie won't be anywhere near the greatest hits boxed set."

The fact that it wasn’t pre-screened for critics, opening cold Friday was sort of a hint that it wasn’t good and it isn’t. There is about one minute with a limbo contest between Freeman and Jones that may give you a hint of a smile but that is it! Freeman fares the best but that is strictly due to his persona.

I seldom, if ever, negative about performers looks but I have to make a few general comments here. Both Freeman and Jones are aging fine up to this point but of the women I wish Elizabeth Ashley hadn’t appeared on the screen as I once thought this woman was beautiful but, to me, that’s not true anymore. I didn’t, gratefully, recognize Jane Seymour during the movie and had to check the credits out to see what part she played.

I am not just picking on the women as I am still shaking my head over my ‘idol’, for many reasons, Johnny Mathis! We are both the same age but he looks 20 years older than he should plus the two songs he sang didn’t sound like the Mathis I know.

It is also one of the most offensive, insulting, and insipid movies I have ever had the misfortune of watching. Dan Fogleman's script is nothing short of emotionally manipulative drivel. I almost can't believe that he wrote and directed this hack-job.

The biggest problem with Life Itself is that it doesn't trust the audience to understand and make connections with the characters. It sets up contrived plot devices and tragedies with no originality and then has the balls to laud itself unironically as ""unique and original."" It has the unmitigated STONES to compare itself to Pulp Fiction. This movie is nothing like Pulp Fiction. If anything, Life Itself is a less-good rip-off of 500 Days of Summer and Manchester By The Sea, but it doesn't even understand how those two movies work.

The premise of Life Itself is that there are two families tied together by a single traumatic event. Characters are drowned in horrible tragedies, there is a Spanish sub-plot that feels tacked on, and the fact that the script tries to tie it all together at the end to make a profound statement is so degrading that the only real tragedy is that I wasted my time watching this movie at all. The movie's theme is ""Life Itself is the ultimate unreliable narrator."" The movie has no problem spoon-feeding you this theme and saying it out loud word-for-word multiple times during the movie. Talk about a stupid waste of a title-drop. I loved This Is Us, but now I am convinced that Dan Fogelman is a ****."

by JOAN ALPERIN on SEPTEMBER 18, 2018

A CELEBRATION OF LIFE ITSELF
Writer/director Dan Fogelman is currently represented on TV with his creation This Is Us, which follows two parents and their three children, born on the same day as their father. Now entering its third season, the NBC show takes place in the present but also utilizes flashbacks so we see how events in the past shape who the characters are today.

In Life Itself – which opens in cinemas this week — Fogelman uses a similar technique, but now weaves together a story that concerns multiple couples over numerous generations and how they are all connected by one event.

It begins with Will (excellent Oscar Isaac) and Abby (Olivia Wilde), who are first shown at a college party, where Will says he’s “just waiting for the right moment” to ask her out. “Because when I ask you out, there’s not going to be any turning back for me.” At one point, he becomes the narrator of his story informing us that “he loves her like a stalker.”
We then find a disheveled Will at the office of his shrink (Annette Bening), where he relates that it’s strange to think about how a completely random moment would shape an entire life. Then it’s back to Abby and Will, now madly in love, married and pregnant.

Fate will link them to Dylan (Olivia Cooke) a troubled young woman trying to find her way in the world, and her grandfather Irwin (Mandy Patinkin). Then it’s off to Spain where we meet a rich plantation owner, Mr. Saccione (the wonderful Antonio Banderas), his plantation manager Javier (Sergio Peris-Mencheta), and Javier’s wife Isabel (Laia Costa) and their son Rodrigo (Alex Monner). It’s their poignant story that will take one of them back to where the film began — the streets of New York City.

Spanning decades as well as continents, the film explores the human condition and all its complications: love, family, tragedy, joy, fate and — in the end — life itself. While some may see this tearjerker as manipulative, I absolutely loved every second of it, my favorite of the year so far.

In a way the movie reminds me of Jackie Chan's The Myth. Both follow the story of a researcher in a quest to find ancient artifact. Along the way his consciousness is mysteriously and magically transported across space and time. Thus, he relives the past life in awkward parallel perspective. It has all sorts of epic romance fantasy elements, all of them are merely skin deep, and most importantly it lacks any charm on the characters.

The main problem is the movie tries so hard to pack beautiful scenery, it sporadically shift sequences without establishing the character in any meaningful manner. First act alone sees myriad of subplots, it immediately enters a conspiracy, political and love banters. Note that it opens with two different timelines and stories, so when the movie introduces predicament so suddenly, it barely gives any sense of familiarity for the characters and audience probably wouldn’t care much for them.

Writing is similar to astrology reading, fortune telling, or straight up fortune cookie gibberish. It wants to be a romantic lore, yet it sounds very pretentious with its ""love conquers all"" cliché. This ultimately ruins the characters as even though the cast is good, the material barely give them any depth or recognizable trait other than fantasy wannabes. The drive for relationship is simply absent.

It doesn't create momentum, and the drab pace continues, or even worsens towards the end. It's as though the vistas are the actual star and these people are the background. There are some good views here, it's clearly an above average production with costumes, intricate sets and occasional action scattered between. However, without amiable personalities, it becomes a boring escapade with cheap plastic romance.

Flair for aesthetic won't help much if the core human drama is overwhelmingly barren."

Mads Mikkelsen is indisputably a cool guy, the Danish Idris Elba, as it were, and his more contemplative half of the movie with Vanessa Hudgens in the snowy town is pretty ok. Even some of the humor there works. The action scenes, of which there aren't really that many, are also ok. If the movie had remained on that level, it'd be about a 6.

Unfortunately the other half is embarrassing cheesy trash trying so hard and failing so abysmally at creating scenes similar to ones from cool movies made by people with talent.

The movie was supposed to be a parody of westerns, but it was not funny. Racism was a big part of the script, but I know that for whatever reason a lot of people are going to just dismiss that as ""SJW"" nonsense, and the racism has been pointed out enough times that it doesn't need another mention by me. I think everyone knows that part.

Even if you're willing to dismiss that on the grounds of it being ""liberal"" or ""SJW"" crap, you can't deny the movie was insanely boring. This movie did not deserve to be 2 hours long. It was not that good, nor was it good at all. Gross out comedy and being intentionally offensive are just lazy humor. That's all this movie was: Pure laziness.

After seeing the trainwrecks that were Grown Ups 2, and That’s My Boy I figured Sandler couldn’t stoop any lower, I was wrong. The Ridiculous 6 is unfunny, terribly acted, overly silly, dumb, and truly terrible in almost all facets. It seems sad because Sandler is talented, but if he continues making films like this, he can’t maintain an audience.
Adam Sandler has become increasingly lazy over the last few years, but this film goes beyond that. Ridiculous 6 features an odd type of humor, which is a combination of dumb, silly, and racist. The humor is so stupid, it rarely registers as funny, but often feels like awkward moments of randomness. The film features a ton of cameos, most of them are distracting and not funny, except Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain.     The humor was not only dumb, but it was exceedingly silly too.
The film’s acting is terrible, on every level. Sandler feels like he’s mailing in his performance, while Taylor Lautner takes a giant step backwards as an actor. While Rob Schneider, Luke Wilson, and Terry Crewes manage to not come across as distractingly bad, almost every performance is awful. What doesn’t help the acting is that the film has almost no story, terrible dialogue, and characters that are just racist stereotypes. It’s sad looking at it, because many talented actors appear in the film, but they are all totally wasted.
The story of Ridiculous 6 is more a bunch of random situations sloppily put together, built entirely on logical fallacies. Since the story is terribly constructed it feels bloated, and the film drags on. In retrospect the film is really about a half-hour too long. On top of that the film’s villains are weak, and thus the film’s conflict feels fake, and forced. Really when looking at closely it all comes down to the fact, that the film was lazily constructed.
In conclusion The Ridiculous 6 represents a new low for Adam Sandler, who continues to get lazier, and lazier. The film is dumb, silly, racist, boring, not funny, and features a story that is so poorly written a 4 year old could have produced a better story. Hopefully, Sandler feels a negative backlash and finally takes some pride in his work, because he clearly has none now."

Its official he has invaded our theatres and our homes. Netflix certainly doesn't value quality after offering him a movie deal. The cast is full of typical Sandler collaborators and some talented names like Nick Nolte and Luke Wilson. Sandler co-wrote this movie and if he gave a damn he maybe could've created a notable comedy franchise with this movie because the story has a good amount of potential but the delivery is terrible. The characters are extremely undeveloped and unfunny. Then you have the completely terrible character played by Jorge Garcia who does not speak a comprehendible word in the whole movie. Then the movie is too long and is filled with plenty of obvious Sandler stunt doubles in the action scenes. Then the tone is some unpredictable and sometimes it even difficult to see who the main character is because there it seems like different actors get too much attention at times. As far as I'm concerned Netflix just pissed away 60 Million.
