https://www.metacritic.com/movie/moonlight-2016/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,kyle20ellis,"Mar 18, 2022",8,"Wanted to see as many 2016 films as possible, especially those that won or were nominated for the big awards. Took me a while to see 'Moonlight', with the controversy it garnered when it was announced for the Best Picture Oscar and the amount of hate it's got here part of me was wary.

Finally getting round to seeing 'Moonlight', it turned out that it was more than well worth the while and that the wariness was not needed. 'Moonlight' is not a perfect film and may not have been my personal pick for the Best Picture award (for me that was 'La La Land' though that is not a popular opinion it seems). Truly admired what it set out to do and found it a brave and powerful film, despite what the detractors say there is far more to 'Moonlight's' appeal than politics, sexuality and race (clearly trying to find conspiracy theories and reasons for why a film they dislike is loved by others, without taking into account that the film simply just connected to and resonated with those who liked it).

'Moonlight' does end on an anti-climactic note, some of the last act is a bit rushed. A longer length would have helped as a result, it also would have helped make a couple of events in the first act a little clearer and not so choppy.

It may not say much new, despite the ground-breaking concept on paper with the exploration of lives rarely seen on film, and doesn't always have subtlety. Then again it is tackling far from subtle themes and a heavy subject, so that sort of was going to be inevitable.

However, 'Moonlight' is an exceptionally well made film. The cinematography and editing are some of the most eye-pleasing and best of that year, and can't find anything to fault the expertly handled direction. The music is cleverly mixed and has haunting power and fluidity.

Regarding the writing, it is not perfect, at times as said a little heavy-handed and vague in parts, but it is thought-provoking and handles very ambitious, relevant, important themes with power, truth and (mostly) delicacy. The story makes the most of the three act structure, it's handled simply but not simplistically and also handled cleverly and with passion, honesty and intelligence. Found myself relating quite a lot to and being moved significantly by the story and found the film handled a heavy and sensitive subject matter with a lot of relevance and importance today more than admirably.

Can't fault the acting, doing wonders with compellingly real characters and strongly defined character relationships (especially the central one). Much has been made of Maharshala Ali and Naomie Harris and deservedly with two of the best performances that year, Ali especially is extraordinary. It is easy though to overlook Alex R. Hibbert, Trevante Rhodes and Ashton Sanders and one shouldn't, as they are just as worthy (particularly Sanders).

Overall, didn't completely blow me away but very well done and with a lot to admire. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/moonlight-2016/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,ben1322,"Sep 4, 2021",9,"The best way to describe Moonlight is a painting that is so realistic that it looks like a picture. The film tackles issues people may not have even crossed that average viewer's mind and does it brilliantly. It does not over dramatize, or over romanticize any moment. Everything is exactly how it should be. It provides insight into all types of challenges mixed into one perspective. Camera work also makes the movie feel first person. Scenes where the camera is half submerged into the ocean invokes nostalgia of when you were young and could barely keep your head above water. Everytime the film leaps in time to a different point in Chiron’s life, the viewer has a lot of catching up to do. Chiron changes on the surface in a substantial manner. However, eventually, you realize that each and every Chiron is the same on the inside. The message of self identity in this film is hammered home. I go back to my point of the film being a realistic painting. Many directors aim for twists on their films to make it feel authentic to themselves, similar to how Picasso may skew his paintings to make it identifiable as “a Picasso” . Barry Jenkins' approach was to make this film authentic to the viewer. He focused on the truth of the matter at hand. He found success in making the matter relatable to viewers who may have never thought to relate to Chiron."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/parasite/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,ryansmith512025,"May 4, 2025",10,"Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece ""Parasite"" deserves every accolade it has received. The directing is absolutely flawless, with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the film's themes of social inequality. The way Bong uses vertical space to represent class hierarchy is brilliant - from the cramped semi-basement of the Kim family to the architectural marvel of the Park residence. 

The script is equally impressive, seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary. The dialogue is razor-sharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced, with shocking twists that never feel contrived. The way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to Bong's exceptional storytelling skills.

What elevates this film beyond mere social commentary is how it refuses to paint its characters in black and white terms. Both families are sympathetic yet flawed, making the inevitable collision all the more devastating. I give it a perfect 10/10 - a true modern masterpiece that rewards multiple viewings."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/parasite/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,drqshadow,"Sep 24, 2024",9,"A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naïve, white collar household.

Unpredictably composed, Parasite shifts effortlessly between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in deep breaths, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, the inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.

The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."

A watermark for modern-day suspense that combines social commentary, cringe comedy, and nail-biting tension in ways that are exhilarating and unprecedented.  The cast is terrific, with Song kang-ho, Park so-dam, and Cho yeo-jeong all standing out as highlights.  The script is razor-sharp, with every set piece and character decision leading to jaw-dropping results.  The Kim family is sympathetic, but their actions often veer squarely into anti-hero territory.  Bong joon-ho is a master of his craft.  There are some shots in this movie that belong in a museum, including one framed mostly in darkness near the end of the movie that will take your breath away.  The pacing is perfect, with every ounce of tension mined from each scene until the consequences of the Kims' actions comes to bear.  Run and see this one, and get ready to be wowed."

I disagree with some of the extreme fanfare, but that is not to say that many of his works are quite stellar. While I still prefer Children of Men, Roma offers many new experiences that I admit to enjoying. Roma is mostly a stark drama which explores class divide, marital struggle, and how unresolved broken relations can leave lasting wounds. The cinematography is the best part of Roma; there are maybe two poorly shot scenes, but the others more than make up for these. Roma is filled with expansive landscapes and busy scenes. The set pieces and extras are phenomenal; nothing feels phoney and there is a lot of everything. The riot and search scenes are filmed over large sprawling areas with well-coordinated groups of people all portraying different characters. Roma tells the story of a dysfunctional family, the maid who serves them, and the struggles they face as the economy and family structure collapse around them. Cuarón has truly created a long-lasting masterpiece in Roma, something that will be studied and returned to again and again."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/roma/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Alex_P,"Mar 30, 2020",10,"Roma... is single handedly the most slow paced and boring movie I have ever watched. But it is also the most exciting, scary, thought provoking and interesting movie I've ever seen. It takes it's time to tell a story, and it makes that clear in the first couple minutes of the film, where we watch a floor being washed for a solid 3 minutes, which doesn't seem like long but it drags on. The first two acts are interesting, sure, but slow and it drags out. Then all of a sudden, in the third act, BAM! everything happens, and we have been well prepared with the previous hour and 30 minutes of film to deal with it. It is definitely not everyone's movie, but wow, it's one hell of a snail ride.
The cinematography speaks for itself, as most people associate Roma with the cinematography. It is fantastic, probably the best I've seen, but people don't give enough credit to the sound editing. If you haven't seen it yet, do NOT watch this on a tv (unless itis widescreen surround sound) watch it on a big phone or tablet, with a wide screen and put high quality surround sound headphones in. Obviously It would of been ideal to watch it at the cinema, but it's too late now. You really need to pay attention to this movie, don't have it on in the background, you need to watch it and focus on it
The reviews speak for themselves, this is less of a movie, more like Art, with a Capitol A."

Dort trifft er seinen 16-jährigen Neffen Patrick (Lucas Hedges), den er schon Jahre nicht mehr gesehen hat und jetzt soll er sich um ihn kümmern. Der Film zeigt in mehreren Rückblenden die Geschichte von Lee und wie er so geworden ist. In Manchester trifft er unter anderem seine Ex-Frau wieder und dessen neuen Freund.

Manchester by the Sea ist ein trauriges Drama. Der Film thematisiert den Umgang mit dem Verlust von Familienmitgliedern. Lees Geschichte ist sehr traurig anzusehen und es ist nachvollziehbar, warum er so geworden ist. Die ersten zehn Minuten sehen wir ihn in Boston, wie er seinem Job nachgeht und er schüchtern ist und Probleme dabei hat neue Leute kennenzulernen und dass er ein Alkoholproblem hat. Ich finde Lee, trotz seiner Probleme sympathisch und kann mich in ihn hineinversetzen. Die Beziehung zwischen ihm und seinem Neffen geht auf Distanz, weil er Angst hat, noch jemanden zu verlieren. Der Soundtrack ist überragend, vor allem in den emotionalen Momenten. Casey Affleck hat zu Recht den Oscar als bester Hauptdarsteller gewonnen. Der Cast generell ist super ausgewählt und man kann jede Figur nachvollziehen. Manchester by the Sea ist ein schöner, emotionaler Film, welcher einen berührt und über die Familiensituation nachdenken lässt. Der Film zeigt, dass es schlechte Familien gibt, man sich trotzdem ändern kann.

Featuring a great script and outrageously natural acting, this movie possesses absolutely no schlock, pulls no punches, and sacrifices balancing its mood in favour of displaying unprecedented levels of existential cruelty.

Though this movie possesses a certain subtle beauty in its narrative, at its core, it generally depicts a cynical apathy that is punctuated by the loudest kind of bitter suffering. The beauty lies within its bleakness, which can make it as powerful as it is difficult to watch.

While not a movie with general appeal, Manchester by the Sea's bold display of uninterrupted pain and suffering is laudable, and is worth watching for those who can manage to bear witness to the on-screen cruelty it often demonstrates."

‍ The beauty of the visuals, the clear visual language, the outstanding performances, and the deliberate staging evoke not just cinematic painting but infuse the entire film with an almost unbearable tension. Or rather: the feeling that something will end before it has even begun. I can recall only a few films that have conveyed this feeling so profoundly to the audience.

 Initially, I had to embrace the formal, almost rigid staging, look more closely, peek beneath the surface—just like with a painting, where hidden emotions only reveal themselves through active observation. What is shown, and what is left out?

Directed by Raoul Peck and narrated by Samuel L. Jackson, the film presents vast amounts of archival footage from the civil rights era, juxtaposed against modern day representations of racial conflict, in which both the past and present are contextualized by the words of writer James Baldwin.

Given that the source material is nearly 40 years old, many of Baldwin’s thoughts and opinions on the black experience in America ought to feel dated, yet the overall feeling leaving the theater isn't about how far we've come, but how much farther we still have to go."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-am-not-your-negro/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TVJerry,"Feb 18, 2017",8,"James Baldwin was a distinguished black writer and an outspoken critic of race relations in America. There are elements of a traditional doc in this film, but it's more an artistic treatise using Baldwin's eloquent words (quietly voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) and charismatic on-screen appearances to delineate his musings on the subject. It's supported with disturbing historical photos and excerpts from Hollywood films. There is a focus on 3 great leaders of the civil rights movement (Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King), but the extended analysis sometimes becomes repetitive or seems to ramble. Even so, this is a forceful examination that sadly still rings true more than 50 years later."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-am-not-your-negro/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Feb 10, 2017",7,"(Disclosure--not full: I met James Baldwin at the 92nd Street YMCA in NYC just after his second book ""Giovanna's Room"" was published and he was participating on a panel for what was very rare at that time talking about gay sex, black men and women in the 1950s none of the  3 related to each other. At that time he was friends with Marlon Brando and Wally Cox and I had lived next door to the former and when he saw me he hugged me and asked me to join them for  a bite to eat afterwards. For awhile I became part of their circle though I certainly was on the outer circle!)

With all that said after he went to live in Paris I didn't see him nor when he came back so I didn't know too much about his last book that wasn't finished when he died and Director Raoul Peck decided to make this documentary using Baldwin's words, and public appearances, to finish the book.

James Baldwin knew Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Junior, and all 4 men, in the 1970s, wrote and spoke about events that took place many decades before and, unaware, all talked about events that are taking place today.

""I Am Not Your Negro"" is an in your face look at race relations in our country from day one until today and though it is Oscar nominated it would be better seen on HBO or PBS or showed in classrooms for all ages.

I do hope whoever sees this will be lead to the readings of James Baldwin's from his ""Go Tell It On The Mountain"" to ""Giovanni's Room"", ""The Fire Next Time"", ""Notes Of A Native Son"", ""Another Country"" just to name a few that will have you entertained, moved, educated and intrigued."

I was completely blown away by his intelligence, his insight and his verbal acuity in numerous old television appearances.  It is so sad that there are so many people in this country who hate people because they are black or because they are white or because they are gay or because they have the audacity to challenge existing societal norms.  One of the most amazing things about Baldwin that I got from this film is that he, unlike other outspoken civil rights leaders of the 1960s, is that he didn't hate white people.  He just saw what was so obvious to him then, and is obvious to me now, that there are many ignorant people who hate other people based on their skin color, ethnicity or religion.  This film was so powerful to me that I watched another documentary about him the next day and I am now reading Baldwin.  If you have an open mind and want to learn about a great writer and communicator then this is a movie you will adore.  But posting a 0 review for a movie you did not see is just ignorant."

Carol

Gazing each other across the room or touching someone for the first time or even talk about them to someone else is depicted as electrifying as it is in real life and this is something that very few of them can achieve. Carol is a suave and mild love story that is too practical to be a film and still Todd Haynes pulls it off with Phyllis Nagy's smart adaptation from the novel with enough drama for the audience to rely upon for 2 whole hours. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are the keys that withholds the audience throughout the movie with a great supporting cast like Sarah Paulson and Kyle Chandler.

The singing is undoubtedly great and its nice to see the atmosphere in the small, church, venue - its quite infectious even, although, obviously, in a good way!. The songs are quite atmospheric and I'd be surprised if you didn't find yourself tapping your toes to the various catchy tunes, such as 'Mary, Don't You Weep', 'What A Friend We Have in Jesus' and the titular 'Amazing Grace'. The picture is slightly grainy I suppose but then, of course, this was recorded some time ago and I guess you could say it adds to the sentimentality/nostalgic aspect of it. I thought it was a bit of a shame that there's no additional information about the singers life given alongside the performances - I suppose I assume that music documentaries will include more than 'just' the music itself but that's not to say that it's not a good, uplifting, entertaining and enjoyable musical performance because it is. I suppose I think of it more like a concert film than a music documentary as such. In any case, she certainly had a pretty amazing voice and she made the most of it.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/amazing-grace-1972/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MarkHReviews,"Apr 19, 2019",9,"“Amazing Grace” is a revelation.  That this documentary even exists is a miracle.

In January, 1972, a 29-year-old Aretha Franklin recorded a live gospel album.  Over two days, with the help of Rev. James Cleveland (himself a well-known gospel singer), the Southern California Community Choir and the studio musicians who had helped make her the Queen of Soul on Atlantic Records, Aretha recorded at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Watts, Los Angeles.  “Amazing Grace,” the resulting album, became the best-selling gospel recording of all time.

The songs selected for the album, and indirectly the film, are an eclectic blend.  They include traditional gospel hymns, a mash-up of Carole King’s “You’ve Got a Friend” with the gospel tune “Precious Lord,” Marvin Gaye’s “Wholy Holy.”  With my Baptist upbringing, I was literally sobbing throughout “What a Friend We Have in Jesus” and “Amazing Grace” – with Aretha in full flight, the choir in full-throated response and the audience in rapture.  In fairness, my wife, one of the more empathic souls on the planet, was completely dry-eyed and found the film “an interesting anthropology lesson.”  So your experience may vary.

Sensing that something magical was about to happen during these recording sessions, Warner Brothers studio (which owned Atlantic Records) hired director Sidney Pollack to document the proceedings.  With five cameramen, he recorded every moment.  The result was over twenty hours of audio recording and over 1500 video scenes, including shots of Mick Jagger standing, clapping and singing (the Stones were in LA to record “Exile on Main Street”).  The structure of this documentary is quite bare-bones. There are almost no side conversations, no voiceovers for context and no interviews with any of the participants.  This austere structure allows Pollack and his crew to focus on the most important task – capturing Aretha singing at the height of her powers, often in extreme close-up.

Now on to the miraculous part.  Presumably because they were filming and recording a live performance, Pollack and his crew never “slated the scenes” (using the wood clapper to mark the beginning of the upcoming scene).  In 1972, slating the scene was the only way to accurately sync 16mm video with the audio, which came from two different sources.  After months of effort, including hiring Choir Director Alexander Hamilton for $200/week to lip-read some of the video, producers decided this problem was insurmountable.  The project was abandoned and the materials shelved for decades.

In 2007, Producer Alan Elliott purchased the raw footage from Warner Brothers, unaware of the syncing problem.  Fortunately, what was impossible in 1972 could by then be conquered through digitization.  However, because the tapes had sat in a basement unattended for over 35 years, they first had to be “re-baked” (literally placed in an oven and heated to over 130 degrees) so they would not disintegrate while being digitally processed.  The finally-synced footage was edited into the final version of the documentary by 2015.  For reasons unknown, Aretha then sued to block release.  Only after a screening for Franklin’s family following Aretha’s death last year did her estate eventually allow the film to be shown publicly.

So, this documentary is forty-seven years in the making, but wow, was it worth the wait.  “Amazing Grace” – how sweet the sound!"

However, while the picture is somewhat typical of concert films of the day, it comes across as somewhat amateurish by contemporary standards (unfocused cinematography, choppy editing, inconsistent sound quality, etc., material quite surprising from a director like Sydney Pollack). See it for the Queen's superb performance, but don't be disappointed by the rest of it."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dunkirk/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,drqshadow,"Sep 20, 2024",7,"The terror of a quiet solitude, exposed on an endangered French beach and desperately awaiting evacuation at the height of World War II. Abandoning the more experimental themes he toyed with in Inception and Interstellar, Christopher Nolan has set out to make a mostly-straight war picture, shining his spotlight on a major test (and ultimate turning point) for the British armed forces. Told from three entangled perspectives - one each from land, sea and air - we see heroes, victims, cowards and lunatics emerge from what might have otherwise seemed a nondescript group of frightened young men.

Dunkirk is far less bombastic than the standard combat film, with a soft, observant character and distinct lack of extraneous dialogue. That reticence, paired with an emphasis on beautifully-composed photography, reminded me more of an art film than an action epic. The battlefield's thick tension is inescapable, though, always drawing us back to the moment, with the wary skyward eyes and skittish, shell-shocked nature of nearby soldiers proving a constant reminder that arbitrary death could be mere moments away. It’s also the rare positive example of a recent tendency toward uneven sound mixes: a barrage of gunfire or sudden, screaming airborne bombing run can pack a mighty punch."

Whereas audiences were entering theaters expecting to be greeted with the next Saving Private Ryan or Platoon, they were exposed to an onslaught of the senses; overwhelming human conviction, the pressure of time, Nolan writing it as its own character, and the realistic deption between navy and civilian. 

And boy oh boy was I happy to be surprised! Nolan crafted not a tale, story, or insight into a tiny aspect of the war. But successfully detected a literal experience, not telling, showing, and dramatizing what happened but simply depicting the events that unfolded while emphasizing the already very enticing literal events that unfolded at Dunkirk. 

By using simple yet effective plot devices and strong characters Christopher Nolan did not craft a film but an experience of what was. 

Dunkirk should be seen at least once by... well... simply anyone."

The film is about a man who receives a letter that a body has been found in a glacier and it is that of his ex-girlfriend, who died in a freak accident during his youth and her body presumably lost. This sets off a chain of events that shakes this 45 year marriage to the core. Rampling's character then begins to question everything she knew about her husband and how deep his love for her really is. Especially when he begins to reminisce of his past love and she comes to the bitter realization that she isn't the true love of his life and never was. It's a very bitter film and you can't help but sympathize for her character every step of the way."

This little British romance-drama was not expected by everyone. Without Charlotte Rampling's Oscars nominee for the lead role, it would have been an easily forgotten. Because it is very slow, the story is just okay, but the performances are the saviour IMO. At this age, Charlotte Rampling was looking so good on the screen, her youthful costume was maybe the reason.

The story of a long married couple, the whole movie takes place on the eve of their 45th anniversary celebration. A week to go for their big day, the wife discovers some hidden secret by her hubby. While digging it only gets bigger, but how it would affect their present relationship was told quite interestingly. It was only a single perspective tale, so the detail on the other side are not briefed to us that well. But everything was quite understandable.

In some relationship, some secret needs to be left untouched for good, only if it is not hurting anybody. Life is a long journey if you're an old and to look back your path. What happened a long time ago is not to be judged for the in between timeline events. In someone's perspective, some past incidents are fair. The beauty of this drama is simply lies how smoothly narrated this complicated issue between a husband and wife. Because even if you're not a regular movie goer, still you can name a couple of similar titles, but how unique this was when comparing with those is that's where it betters. It was not so good, but much better in many ways, in its own way.

This was one of those movies that lingers in your head so much, The Cranberries could have written a song about it. Let me preface, this movie is only 90 minutes, and the first 80 are so incredibly slow it's like you're being forced to watch How It's Made  in High School P.E., but boy does it pay off. The ending of this movie punches you in the gut with so much futility you'll think Gone Girl had a happy ending. I will also preface this movie is not for people who disapprove of sad endings, this movie can only be described as ""Soul-crushing."" Also, don't bring a date if you want the relationship to last. Couples should have at least 10 years of bliss under their belt, or be confident enough to claim they're the next Niles and Daphne Crane.

Picking  one central character, played by Charlotte Rampling, and having Tom Courtney's grieving husband secondary lessens the depth of the movie. She is shown as the victim, while he comes across as self centered, which makes his grief shallow, thus trying to force us to pick her as the aggrieved one, where in reality both stories deserve our respect. Rampling is very good as the emotions cascading inside her broil under the surface while she struggles with the ever expanding revelations that devestate her."

I, too, go to 50-100 movies a year, most of which we ""screen"" through Metacritic overall scores, unless something else draws us. For example, Woman in Gold was rated orange but we love Helen Mirren and we loved that movie.  My wife is more sensitive to movies like 45 Years than I am, and there were times in the early stages of the film, I sought more ""action"".  That ultimately was naive on my part.  My wife understood the nuances, particularly of Rampling's understated performance far better than I.  I love the Platters, and when ""Smoke Gets in your Eyes"" played, I hummed along instead of carefully listening to the words.  When I got home and googled the lyrics, WOW!  The more reviews I read that night and thought about the movie (I couldn't STOP thinking about it), the more I loved it.  So, do NOT miss this movie and go to it with an open mind, watch very carefully (remember the movie Sixth Sense, and how you had to wanted to watch it again to understand how you could have missed the clues?) or you will miss much.  I think it will be challenging for younger people to get this movie.  Furthermore, if you are a little hard of hearing, you will miss some of the quiet, British dialogue.

Mr. Courtenay plays a subdued and stoic role as he attempts to move on from the past while Ms. Rampling’s character becomes more absorbed with the historic details as if this now deceased part of her husband’s life is still alive and in competition with her. Enough cannot be said of the wonderful acting of Ms. Rampling who, with little or no dialogue, is able to express more emotion and feeling than most actors might if they were shouting. Although the film is long and at times somewhat tedious, it is in effect mirroring the relationship of the couple on the screen as they, in their typical British civility, struggle through the emotional obstacles that confront them. I give the film a 0 rating and credit Mr. Haigh with successfully accomplishing the dual role of good writing and directing."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/45-years/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Timbaros,"Jan 27, 2016",9,"A 45-year relationship is in trouble after Geoff Mercer receives a letter informing him of news about his first love, which his wife Kate did not know of, in the new film 45 Years.

Tom Courtenay is Geoff, while Charlotte Rampling is Kate, both giving superb performances. They play a couple who have been together for 45 years in the lead up to their huge anniversary party, but it’s on the Monday that Geoff receives that letter letting him know that the body of Katya, his previous love before Kate, has been found in the Swiss Alps. Oh so many years ago Geoff and Katya were on a walking holiday when Katya fell into a fissure in a glacier, with her body never actually found. It’s the letter that Geoff receives that brings him back to the memories of his first love, but it does the opposite to Kate. She actually never knew much about Katya because Geoff really never spoke about her much, but the letter seems to peak her interest in their relationship, and she learn things that Geoff had never confessed to her. Kate didn’t know that they were very serious about each other because it’s something that Geoff never talk about, all those years they’ve been together. Has he been hiding from Kate the true nature of him and Katia’s love for each other? Kate then calls into question her relationship with Geoff. Is she his true love? Or was it Katia? Kate increasingly becomes preoccupied, and worried about this. There’s also something within Geoff that has changed. He has begun smoking again, and he’s been going into the attic to look at the photos of him and Katia. Kate soon discovers that Katia was pregnant with Geoff’s child, and that Geoff having told Kate that he had planned to Marry Katia. As the huge anniversary party gets nearer, and as each day progresses, Katia becomes very unsure and unconfirment of Geoff’s love for her, but will this new revelation cancel/ruin the party?

Director Andrew Haigh, best known for his 2011 film Weekend which captured the short weekend relationship between two gay men, does a similar take in 45 Years, where he captures, in a week’s time, a long-term relationship between a straight married couple, in the lush surroundings and landscape of the Norfolk countryside. It’s a different perspective from his previous work, as well as from his hit television show ‘Looking’ – about gay men in San Francisco. In ’45 Years,’ he makes us slowly progress to the big day, that of the anniversary celebrations, with uncertainty, nervousness, and sadness, not just for Kate, but for Geoff as well. It’s like their entire relationship is being suddenly called into question. And Courtenay and Rampling give excellent performances. Courtenay’s Geoff seems to have no clue how this revelation is affecting Kate, while Rampling’s Kate slowly absorbs the truth about Katia, and is having a harder and harder time accepting it. Hers is an Academy Award worthy performance, and she’s been nominated (but somehow snubbed by the BAFTA’s – it’s a crime!). Based on a short story by British Poet David Constantine called Another Country, 45 Years slowly builds itself from a film that is a very simple quiet relationship of a long-married couple into a loud obstruction where it’s questionable whether there is any point to go nay further. 45 Years stars out as peaceful and quiet, yet gets messier and destructive. It’s one of the best and most beautiful films of the year."

This isn't always the easiest film to watch, but it leaves an indelible impression on anyone who sees it."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/45-years/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Pontefractious,"Jan 19, 2016",9,"A teacher and a factory manager who has climbed his way up from the shop floor are retired and shortly to celebrate their 45th wedding anniversary. News comes that the body of a long ago girlfriend has emerged from a glacier in Switzerland. Little by little we learn that she died in an accident, that they were in love, that he has kept photos and mementos (in contrast to the 45 years of his marriage where they have nothing), and that she was expecting. The film is the story of the impact that this revelation has on the couple's relationship.
Most reviews have focused on the relationship's deterioration and the whys and wherefors. Curiously, though some came close, to my mind not one critic got it right. To understand the process fully you must appreciate that when these two married, distinctions of class were very much alive in the UK (some would say they still are). These two were never a good match. Perhaps the most ""in your face"" clue is his three failed efforts to get beyond chapter two of Kierkegaard. There are others such as Kate's expressed pleasure when he talks about bird watching. Here is not a man who enjoys intellectual pursuits. Again, his strong working class roots show in his complaint after the re-union lunch that the Len that they used to call Len-in now has a holiday home and a daughter dating/married to (I can't remember which) a banker. Jeff is clearly upset by this sell-out. But we don't really need these clues - Jeff clearly has what back then when they got married would have been considered a working class accent. And if you still need to be convinced, listen to Jeff talking during his speech at the party and referencing Kate's father's opposition to the marriage. Kate's father knew.
Kate, in contrast is educated (one critic noted that she was a head teacher). Her passage of arms with the caterer clearly indicates that she has taste and does not suffer fools gladly. But Kate has sublimated her middle class self. She must have realized at an early stage that the two of them have nothing in common. And here is the key. She has spent the last 45 years selflessly making the marriage work with precious little help from the self-centered Jeff. If pressed she would admit that it has involved sacrifice but it has paid off since they are still together. And then this happens. Kate gradually comes to the conclusion that that lifetime of sacrifice has been for nothing. The fragile marriage she has sought to preserve is meaningless. She has thrown her life away on someone who settled for her when his first love died. Self-centered Jeff doesn't even realize there has been a sacrifice and wouldn't understand it, still less appreciate it, even if he did. Yes, the revival of old and deep memories has had a strong effect on him. But he doesn't understand why Kate should be affected in any way. And there is the real story.  Kate feels that her whole life has been wasted. Not surprising that she is beyond being upset. Not surprising that that sentimental cloying speech of Jeff''s did nothing to reduce the pain. And what a perfect ending when Kate snatches her hand away. Perhaps the most eloquent gesture in film since Jonathan Pryce checked his watch at his mother's funeral in Ploughman's Lunch."

Her husband has never forgotten his Katcha, and the story of how she re-enters his life and how his reaction **** what seemed to be a solid relationship is beautifully told. I found this tragic story deeply moving and overwhelmingly sad thanks to Rampling’s wonderful portrayal of a woman whose belief in her husband’s love is shaken to the core and, judging by the last scene at their anniversary party, tragically broken forever. Tom Courtney is also wonderful as the husband with the secret."

Holy moly this film is powerful. A stirringly emotional look at marriage and the nature of love as you age, 45 Years features phenomenal lead performances from Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay. Though it is slow and deliberate, the film never drags and really always grips you as you watch it all unfold. The film is interesting in the sense that thought it focuses on Rampling's character, it really provides an astute look at how both men and women look at relationships, in particular at how they progress as the years go on. Wonderfully written and directed by Andrew Haigh, 45 Years is a phenomenal film that deservedly netted Rampling an Oscar nomination, but I do wish it had received more."

It’s a damn shame all the de-aging hullabaloo distracted from his overall performance. Beyond the obvious comeuppance that characterized the 3rd act, it was also in a sense a poignant conclusion to Scorsese’s “gangster” filmography, and almost doubles as a meditation on his own life and career within the genre that has defined him."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/inside-out-2015/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,drqshadow,"Sep 16, 2024",7,"Kudos to Pixar for this one, because they really took a swing with an ambitious, risky leftfield concept that I honestly didn't think could work when I first laid eyes on the trailer. Inside Out does work, and it's often quite clever in touching a broad range of delicate subjects in a way that can be appreciated by audiences young and old alike; no small balancing act. It's uproarious and cute and heady, but I couldn't shake the **** feeling that we were just barely scratching the surface here, even as the plot begins wrapping up.

There's plenty brewing under the table, but it still feels superficial, and the big developments in the third act don't totally feel like they've been earned when the credits roll. Granted, it's got a bushel of heavy messages to share, much more than many of its peers in the CG animation field, but when it's a delivery from the studio that brought us Toy Story, Monsters Inc. and Wall-E, there's a certain unspoken standard to meet. Inside Out represents a rebound for Pixar, certainly the best (and most creative) of their recent efforts, but it's not as sweeping, engulfing, or rewarding as the classic pedestals of their back catalog.

Updated thoughts after a 2024 re-watch: Pixar goes cerebral, visualizing hormones and emotions as walking, talking avatars in the mind of a pre-teen girl. Shaken by a cross-country move at a very sensitive age, we see her struggle from both perspectives: in the upstairs control room, where various color-coded operators are baffled by her mood swings, and in the outside world, where friends and family are similarly perplexed. Inside Out is a high-concept production, one which does occasionally beat us over the head with symbolism, but its writing is generally sharp and clever and it’s adept at distilling lofty ideas to a format that’s digestible for all ages. And Pixar certainly knows how to tug the heart strings, as they do repeatedly during the dueling inside/outside crises at the film’s climax.

Not as consistent as the studio’s better efforts, the plot is a balancing act between moments where the philosophical gambles pay off and those where it gets a little too cute. The vital push-and-pull between Joy and Sadness is at the heart of things, an uneasy friendship/rivalry that tips and sways before reaching a state of zen, and that’s handled very well. The two abstract creatures’ escape through the long-term memory banks and bumpy rides on the train of thought... eh, those felt like more of a reach. A convenient use of familiar terms to suit the narrative.

When they work, Inside Out’s big concepts are deep and powerful; an elegant way to dissect complicated thoughts and feelings by way of shiny blue, gold and purple cupie dolls. When they don’t, the illusion swiftly falls apart. Before the story concludes, we get plenty of the former, but also a not-insignificant helping of the latter. A nice rebound from the missteps of Cars 2 and Monsters University, but not quite as sweeping, engulfing, or rewarding as the pillars of the studio’s classic catalog."

Con una duración de 1.30 minutos. Dirigida por Luca Guadagnino, Guionizada por James Ivory, protagonizada por Timothée Chalamet, Armie Hammer entre otros. En 2017 ganadora de un Oscar a mejor guion adaptado. Incluyendo 4 nominaciones, película y actor (Timothée Chalamet). En el mismo año nominada en el festival de Toronto y fue la segunda finalista a mejor película. Es una historia ocurrida en un verano de 1983, el padre de Elio un profesor de arqueología italiano invita a un joven norteamericano llamado Oliver, quien será su asistente de arqueología en un proyecto muy importante. Al principio a Elio no le cae bien Oliver, pero con el tiempo empiezan a despertarse diferentes sentimientos y tensiones entre ellos. Está película trasmite muchas emociones, es muy bonito como a pesar del año en donde se basan los hechos. Las personas entendían y aceptaban la homosexualidad. De algún modo los personajes tenían más libertad para expresar su amor. Es interesante como el director plantea el ejemplo de Elio y Oliver, de cómo comienza a despertar su amor a través del otro, y con el paso de los días es mas fuerte lo que sienten. El desarrollo es lo que más conecta al público que ve la película. Porque se ve como ellos aprovechan cada espacio que tiene solos, para poder amarse de la manera en que lo hacen. Esas emociones tan intensas que muestran atrapan mucho al público.  Como toda película dramática tiene un final muy doloroso para los personajes principales. Esta es una película que sinceramente toca las fibras más profundas de los espectadores. Para terminar, en una película muy recomendada para aquellas personas amantes del romance y drama, en está filme podrán encontrar diferentes escenas de pasión y amor una increíble combinación; sin duda alguna, es una cinta cinematográfica en donde hay mucha valentía e inspiración.

Yes it can sometimes play as a ode to Italy with how often it lingers on landscape an architectural shots but it never does so without contributing well to the stories tone.

an ephemeral love story way too many lgbtqia+ youths can relate to ,falling for an older man, deifying that romance only to be abandoned once the significant other leaves for more ''realistic ''prospects post statutory exploitation. those who critique this film for glorifying pedophilia are unaware of movies being a vehicle for real story's and that not every story has o be attached to an agenda in fact i argue if any agenda is attached it's cautionary and very aware of the lovers age difference. firstly timothy's portrayal is purposefully youthful, he is a boyish man naturally and in the presence of Armie Hammer seems demur .i see his story as a honest telling of a love story one that is one sided .i do not think elio's love is shared by Oliver who's mostly flattered and ****. Its a dark romance and once it's viewed as one he movie is even more impressive as i begin o see the bright Italian setting reminiscent of old co-existing with the new.

The setting is lovely - it's only described as 'somewhere in Northern Italy' and there's some relatively thoughtful dialogue present, although there are some scenes when the characters don't talk too often. I also enjoyed the classical/instrumental music often played in the background, which gives it a somewhat dream-like/floaty feel or sense. I particularly liked the light piano tunes, which had a bit of an ethereal sense to them at times. The characters seem very thoughtful and it's quite an atmospheric film. I would recommend it, yes."

Lifelong tragic comedy, especially the sober dealing with the consequences of a divorce dispute and the whole beginnings of it, including the machinery behind it, especially the common practice in the USA, illustrates the drama behind it all.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-la-land/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,davidlovesfilm,"Oct 20, 2024",10,"""La La Land"" is a visually stunning, emotionally evocative musical that blends classic Hollywood romance with modern-day sensibilities. Written and directed by Damien Chazelle, the story follows Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a passionate jazz musician, as they navigate their dreams, careers, and relationships in Los Angeles. As they pursue their artistic ambitions, their relationship faces both exciting and painful challenges. The movie utilizes a backdrop of vivid color palettes, romantic locations, and jazz music, and captures the dreamlike but realistic highs and lows of juggling both love and success.

The genre of La La Land is a modern musical, drawing from the traditions of Hollywood's Golden Age, such as the dramatic romance and breakup seen at the end of Casablanca, while incorporating the sensibilities of contemporary cinema. While it is an original work, it shares thematic and stylistic connections with his last film like ""Whiplash,"" another film by Chazelle which explores the sacrifices required for artistic greatness. La La Land is not part of a series or an adaptation, but it reflects some nostalgia for musicals while telling a fresh story.

Emma Stone's portrayal of Mia is filled with sincerity and relatability. Her arc—from struggling barista to aspiring actress—strikes an emotional chord, and her performance of ""Audition (The Fools Who Dream)"" is a highlight. Gosling's Sebastian is both parts dreamy and stubborn, focusing on the sacrifices he makes for his music and love. Chazelle's direction is successfully able to bring these elements together, combining musical spectacles with emotional resonance. His understanding of both the extravagant musical genre and the human experience allows La La Land to feel timeless. While the film might feel like a reflection of classic musicals, it raises expectations, especially in its ending that is more bittersweet than a typical Hollywood romance. It’s undeniable that the film takes on the complexity of ambition, love, and personal sacrifice in a meaningful way. It’s about the tension and hardships that come between following your dreams and the realities of life, a theme that resonates with many people in today’s world.

In terms of filmmaking, ""La La Land"" swing for the fences and scores high well in almost every aspect. The cinematography by Linus Sandgren is visually stunning, with sweeping shots which reflect both the characters' emotional arcs and elevate the setting of Los Angeles. The opening scene, a large-scale musical number set on a freeway during rush hour, immediately sets the tone for the film’s playful and extravagant approach to storytelling. The color palette is constructed to evoke each scene’s mood, from the vibrant oranges and pinks of sunsets to the more muted blues and grays used in more somber moments. The editing by Tom Cross allows the film to flow seamlessly from one number to the next, without disrupting the story's emotional rhythm. In particular, the long, uninterrupted takes during dance sequences help show a sense of realism within the world of the movie. The sound design and music by Justin Hurwitz with songs by the duo of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul and are crucial to the story’s emotional depth, with the score and songs such as “City of Stars” and “Another Day of Sun” becoming memorable, almost iconic, pieces of the film.

Ultimately, ""La La Land"" is a cinematic experience that combines beautiful visuals, exceptional music, and deeply emotional performances. Whether you’re a fan of musicals or not, its exploration of relationships and dreams makes it universally enjoyable. The film’s balance of romance, drama, and music is captivating and thought-provoking. In conclusion, I believe La La Land is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates a beautiful film with heart, stunning visuals, and a fantastic score. Its emotional complexity and depth allow it to be considered more than just a simple romance, making it a memorable cinematic experience. I would highly recommend La La Land for anyone looking for a film that is both fun and also leaves them with something to reflect on. The performances, music, and direction make this film something that years from now will stand the test of time still be a highly regarded piece of cinema."

The characters are great, I love how we see them separately living the same day until they meet each other again. Sebastian and Mia share a lot of characteristics, they make a perfect couple. Because of that, I was waiting for the disaster to happen. I kind of knew where it was going and it made the experience nerve-wracking and I like that in a movie. But the ending under performed for me, I was expecting more depth and heaviness. The dialogue writing was amazing though, dynamic and natural.

The cinematography is beautiful and the colour grading is especially unique. Everything was bright except for the sky at night. The editing is also really good, the pacing was perfect. The acting performances are amazing I love both leads, but Ryan Gosling is one of my favourite actors, so I have a soft spot for him.

Alternately addressing her need to rebel, to cast away everything she once held sacred, and to remain true to herself, she frequently acts on impulse, then later deals with the regrets and repercussions. As did many of us, during the moody, impressionable years of adolescence. She's not quite sinking, but not quite swimming, seeking a way out while also realizing how much the familiarity and security of her long-term hometown means to her.

It's a time of transition, of can't-go-back decisions, and the weight of those choices looms over both the title character and her loved ones. For the first time, the heaviness of the real world is infringing upon her, from her family's financial struggles to the slim chances of admittance to her dream schools, and it's no easy road for anyone: herself, her selflessly supportive father or her imposing (and constantly fretting) mother. It covers a lot of emotional churn and introspection in a relatively low-key way, almost exclusively through casual dialogue and dinner-table debates.

The conclusion is a bit off-putting - it doesn't end, just stops - but in some ways, that's a better tonal match than the more theatrical scene that could've been chosen a few minutes earlier. Rich and human and familiar, if not transcendent."

This coming-of-age drama sees the journey of its titular character through the final year of high school. Lady Bird's relationship with her mother is tumultuous and taut as she yearns for a better life and standing.
Lady Bird is a coming-of-age story wholly; it embodies an annoying realism on young adult themes.
Starring Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf (who steals all her scenes), Lucas Hedges, Timothée Chalamet, and Beanie Feldstein, Lady Bird boasts good performances. It's also a good directorial debut for Greta Gerwig.
Everything about Lady Bird is solid and well-made, but it doesn't transform the movie to a grand status like critic reviews suggest. Lady Bird is not a movie that's sure to elicit recommendations, but it's one you won't regret seeing.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lady-bird/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,kyle20ellis,"Mar 18, 2022",10,"With one of my favourite trailers of the year, the awards attention, the theme of coming of age and the critical acclaim, 'Lady Bird' very quickly became one of the year's most anticipated films for me. Deliberately didn't see it at opening weekend though, just in case it was busy and difficult to get tickets, after the insane opening weekend of 'Black Panther'.

'Lady Bird' in no way disappointed. With the above, was hoping that it would be one of my favourite films of the year and it turned out to be exactly that, the awards attention and acclaim more than fully deserved. This doesn't just fly, 'Lady Bird' actually soars and have not seen a coming of age-themed film in recent memory this sparkling or honest or with this amount of humour, brains, heart and charm. Have seen it mentioned as a passion project, and if it was the passion and hard work can be seen all over.

It is a very appealing film visually, with beautiful and colourful cinematography and with editing that flows succinctly and cohesively. The music is has energy yet knows when to understate itself when needed. In her first film as solo director, Greta Gerwig directs with a nimble touch, the comedy is light on its feet and she avoids making the emotional elements heavy-handed or tonally jarring.

The script is one of the year's best, my personal pick actually for this year's Best Original Screenplay Oscar of the nominees. The comedy sparkles in wit and is genuinely hilarious, done in an honest and true to life way yet with some cringes like it would be in real life too. Over-sentimentality is avoided in the more emotional and dramatic scenes, there are some really sweet and poignant moments and an endearing personal touch.

Found myself really emotionally investing in and relating to the mother and daughter relationship, their bonding bringing tears to my eyes and then making me smile and laugh when botched and leaving me with hope at resolution at the same time. The coming of age/angsty elements have a truthfulness, authenticity and twinkle and it was very easy to identify with them if in the same position growing up, they're often very funny but also very heartfelt and charming.

Story is immensely engaging throughout right from the riotous opening to the more emotional and avoiding-being-too-pat ending, anchored by the mother and daughter relationship that entertains, moves and provokes thought. Didn't mind at all that it wasn't ground-breaking, due to not expecting it to be as coming of age can be predictable. Enjoyed the way the characters were written, and appreciated that the film broke away from the typical archetype of school teachers being over-disciplinary and without humour.

Performances are never less than great, with Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf fully inhabiting their characters and phenomenally. It was wonderful for both to get awards attention with both giving two of the year's best performances. Lois Smith twinkles too in her role.

If Lucas Hedges (who has grown quite a lot) and Timothee Chalamet (not as good as his truly remarkable performance in 'Call Me By Your Name' but showing why he is one of the most promising recent rising stars) continue to go down this promising path they are likely to go on to big careers.

Concluding, fabulous film and one of my favourites of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

If I have to be honest, the movie was not particularly interesting. Personally, I appreciate, that it is related to real life, maybe not only related, but also it represents the picture of most people's lives - not knowing who you are, strange relationships and everyday struggle with family members and friends, problems in school and in finding university and intimate life. So, I appreciate the focus on that. It's teen drama though. It says the movie is drama and comedy, didn't rally feel the comedy there. ""Yes, I gave that name to myself. It is given to me by me"" - that was fun haha! Anyway, I am used to teen comedies and I didn't get that movie as comedy. Somehow, soundtracks weren't enough and the script wasn't something special.

I liked the quirky aspect to it and how laidback the main character is. She certainly tests the boundaries in relation to her mother. Also, its more of a drama than a comedy film overall, although there are some amusing moments.

Also true is there aren't exactly no cliches present but its a well presented film and it isn't too cheesy overall, I'd say, so I'd recommend it all the same (plus, in my eyes, Saoirse Ronan can (all but) do no wrong).

I've also liked Greta Gerwig as an actress in films I've seen thus far, so it was interesting seeing this, given its Greta's directorial debut. I reckon she is someone to look out for, as a director, in the future."

Lady Bird tries a bit too hard to come off as artsy and rebellious, which comes off as extremely stereotypical and played out. Even so, the film has an ounce of relatability that’s I find admirable. The theme of trying to find your identity hits me hard as someone struggling to find my own identity, regardless of how the film felt cliché. I find myself relating to Lady Bird in that sense, and that’s one thing that makes the film the slightest bit impressive. I also find the camera work in the last few scenes, specifically the ending when Lady Bird was driving in her car, impressive, and the ending of the movie was wholesome and impactful."

Living well below the poverty line, stealing what they can't afford, their household exists on the outskirts of civilization; a phantom in more ways than one. The general population is perfectly happy to turn a blind eye upon the situation and this ragtag, close-knit little unit is content with the same arrangement, despite the guarded air of closeted secrets looming over the household.

It's the kind of film you know probably doesn't end well, so you just enjoy the good times while they last. The movie itself seems to feel the same way, lingering in those sweet moments of quiet memory and cozy togetherness for as long as it can, delaying the inevitable. Of course, eventually something has to give, and then it's a crushing landslide of sudden public interest and consequence, hitting all the harder for the delicate harmony that existed, so freely, prior to the vortex.

Heartfelt and thoughtful, with a stirring message and no true heroes or villains; just people doing what they think is right, no matter how misguided that might seem from other angles."

It felt quite authentic, although I suppose I wouldn't necessarily know how such people live their lives. I found it endearing how the younger members helped each other out. There is some funny dialogue - in an amusing way, rather than especially laugh out loud. I found myself feeling quite sorry for some people, due to their circumstances. It is surprisingly thoughtful, I suppose. Overall I thought this was a very warm and charming film, which I'd recommend, especially to fans of Japanese films.

O desenvolvimento dos personagens é muito bem feito, estabelecendo muito bem o que eles fazem, porque fazem, e suas consequências. O filme me pareceu lendo a principio, mas cada dialogo tem sua importância narrativa, cujo dá alicerce para as atitudes dos pais, e no futuro dos filhos, que vivem sobre suas influencias. O próprio conceito de família entra em pauta aqui, questionando a visão conservadora, por exemplo.

""Shoplifters"" é um drama complexo, profundo e real que explora a humanidade com uma sutileza quase incomoda, que nos põe pra pensar e se enxergar em tal situação, elevando o ceticismo do consentimento moral de forma muito amena. A direção também é muito atenta, e não subestima o publico com respostas fáceis. ""basta prestar atenção"". Os cortes são uma grande característica disso.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shoplifters/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,AndrewBurge,"Mar 28, 2019",9,"Hirokazu Koreeda's ""Shoplifters"" is the most human film of the year. All more impressive given the fact that it takes place in Tokyo, one of the most advanced and 'robotic' places on Earth. But perhaps this is what gives it power.

The plot is simple enough. A family of small-time crooks decide to take in a child they find outside in the cold--thanks for formulating it for me, IMDB. Her name is Yuri (Miyu Sasaki), still in pre-school. As she slowly blends in with the family, Koreeda pulls us into their small hovel in which they all live crowded on top of each other. But they are happy! I started to ask myself, so what's the problem, exactly? And here it is what this film does best!

Its subtle, it pulls you inside a comfortable family bubble, and then when you feel at peace, you realize that hold on--what about the girl's parents? What about the police looking for her? You suddenly realize that from an outside point-of-view, what they did to her is bad. Instead of returning her to her family, they unofficially adopted her. But Yuri is also reluctant to return home as her parents are neglecting her.

Slowly, two contradicting moral and social views arise yet you can't help but feel that despite the condition in which she leaves, Yuri is better off with her artificial family. But if this were to be part of the news on TV you would definitely not feel the same--I know I wouldn't. Koreeda is using the film's personal and insight view as a means of compelling our morality to offset our ration. But this is not surprising. As an art form, films are made to adhere to our emotions rather than our mind.

There are many great moments in this film, most, although not all, coming from the relationship of this family. I will not spoil them here because they are too many but more importantly they are to be experienced first hand. No surprising plot twists whats-o-ever just pure, personal, relatable humanity."

Its not permanently laugh out loud funny but there are some pretty funny scenes and it focusses on social awkwardness, primarily for the career focussed daughter, Ines, so if you don't like cringe-y moments then this may not be for you (the comedy is sometimes slapstick in nature). Its fair to say she finds herself having to deal with a father who is a practical joker, a tease of sorts, which doesn't necessarily go down well when she's with important colleagues and clients. I enjoyed this film. I was surprised there was so much English present actually as I'd assumed it to be primarily German but there are a number of scenes featuring people representing companies who speak English, so perhaps if your curious about watching foreign language films, this is a half way house a bit, as its not exclusively in a foreign language? (perhaps a third of the film is in English, something like that) having said that, I can't not point out that it is a long watch at almost 2 and three quarter hours long but I certainly enjoyed it and didn't find myself wishing it would end anytime soon, which means its a pretty good film in my book.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Reginthorn,"Mar 16, 2017",7,"I am unsure of how I feel about Toni Erdmann. On the one hand, Toni Erdmann is a film with a huge heart. The premise is simple enough to follow. Essentially, a father (Winfried Conradi), in an existential crisis of sorts, uses an alter ego in order to reconnect with his corporate-driven daughter. The corporation Conradi’s daughter works for is as stereotypically capitalistic as it gets. The film utilizes the process of globalization and corporate culture as a means to amplify the disconnect in the father/daughter relationship. The viewer gets the sense Winfriend was a hippie back in the day. Toni Erdmann often works because the characters are extremely complex. I enjoy films in which the characters exist without an explicit concern for audience expectations. Primary or secondary characters often ramble about subjects which are not necessarily tied to the main narrative. In these moments, the camera will focus on setting up characters in the background or illustrate the state of the speaker’s mind. The fictional events on screen are shown to be natural slices of life. Conradi is only predictable in that he is desperate to reconnect with his daughter, Ines. Often, Conradi as Toni Erdmann resorts to pranks in an attempt to goad out some repressed nature in Ines. Humor organically flows in the awkward situations Erdmann flings into. In short, Toni Erdmann has many moments which are pure comedy gold. The core nature of Toni Erdmann’s (the film) humor is laid bare near the film’s climax. The faults of Toni Erdmann, unfortunately, stem from some of the films’ strengths. As primarily a drama, the humor is inconsistent in where and how long it occurs. The film also allows characters a little too much breathing time. After a key moment, the camera decides it wants to follow the characters around. The argument could be said the choice aides in giving the characters an added depth towards physicality. By physicality, I mean the subtle body languages in a character. However, Toni Erdmann is an almost three-hour affair. A lot of people walked out around the film’s halfway point. Personally, I walked out of the theatre wishing the director had opted to cut about thirty minutes. Character development is at times made explicit in narrative exposition. As a result, the extra attention to body language feels a bit redundant. I might be being a little harsh due to my unfamiliarity with German cinema. Ultimately, I think the film was worth my time."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GinaK,"Feb 27, 2017",9,"I think this is a fascinating film, and one of the best things about it is how the audience gradually caught on to what Inez’s estranged (and strange) father was trying to do here – give his daughter a sense of balance and perspective about life. And at the end, she is still not quite convinced, I think, but I don’t want to include any plot spoilers. However, I think he has helped her (and us) make considerable progress toward understanding her/our own worth and desires. I guess its length is a problem for an American audience, but it is a movie like “Magnolia,” where you just have to surrender and “go with it” to enjoy it.  And I have to confess that I’ve sat through a lot of Wagnerian operas, so listening to incomprehensible German and reading subtitles is not such a shock to me. If you try to relax and enjoy it and not be judgmental (like Inez), the action and craziness will carry you along, and I think you will find it rewarding. It’s a movie I will not soon forget, both for its craziness and for its message. I actually might want to see it again!"
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DirigiblePulp,"Feb 25, 2017",8,"Truly, a comedy epic. Ok, that's mostly the length of the film talking. This is a classic high-concept comedy premise that's so deeply rooted in real human emotion that it only feels outlandish on reflection afterwards.

Quite a bit has been said about the way in which the film refuses to conform to the typical route one like this would take - that of a woman finding a man, realizing she's a Type-A corporate **** who just needs to shut up and be a wife/mom, and all without ever explicitly stating that fact but implying it every step of the way.

Instead, this film meanders and wanders and roams and keeps finding ways to surprise and tickle. The jokes are long cons, ones with mostly huge payoffs. That Ines reaches her revelation both as a result of her father's antics and also her own self-realization feels especially real. What she needed was not so much a change of heart but to be surrounded by one decent person. It's the fault of other corporate cronies and sexist buffoons. It is a slight twist on the formula that makes it near revelatory. The ending eschews trite resolution, suggesting that happiness isn't magically forever after some grand realization but that it is comprised of moments and the mere ability to see that and experience that with someone you love is in itself revelation enough.

I would have preferred less slack direction in regards to the showy-unshowy ""realism"" camera work and scene pacing. There are some scenes that seem shot for no reason whatsoever and others that end abruptly or at absurdly inconvenient times. In short, it tries to be too cute with its form. I'm thinking in particular of the ending where Ines has a naked brunch (my lord when Toni shows up in that costume - haven't heard an audience laugh like that in while) and hilarity ensues as people show up naked until it ends with a well-timed hand on a shoulder. Suddenly people are putting on clothes and Toni leaves and Ines chases and there's no reason for any of it and the scene still had so much more to give. Then there's a strange long-winded follow-through in a park and a little girl and finally a hotel clerk pulling off a mask. A tighter sense of story there (and elsewhere) and we could be talking masterpiece."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"Feb 14, 2017",7,"What do you think is worth living for?

I had tough time to figure it out what was the thing on the poster. Seeing it upside down, with mirror, name it, I used all the tricks I know, but nothing had worked. On the other hand, I thought it might be a fantasy film with a King Kong like creature. That's the curiosity it created, people to a have different opinions and forget to expect from the film. But it was a simple comedy-drama and only way to solve the mystery is to watch the film. That's what I finally did.

The opening scene was good. But I did not think the whole film would be like that. It was about a prankster and his attempts to reach his workaholic daughter, which was the entire narration. A lifetime trip for them, that's not about the challenges in the world or the nature, but their self-discovery, the meaning of life and purpose. This is one of the beautiful films to open up about a father and daughter relationship. In the grown-up world, the people forget to live the actual life, when they give all the focus to their professional life.

I have to agree, this is a competitive world and you will be replaced by millions of other waiting behind you for such opportunity. But does it all worth doing is the real question. Doubts like that won't arise without those who love us pointing it out. It needs to be asked properly, politely. But some people take an alternate route like in this film. Sometimes it ends in an unexpected adventure to just realise what they are into. And this film was honest, to reveal as much as it can in many angles.

This is the story of Winfried. An aged and divorced music teacher who makes practical jokes to people around him. After his dog died, he decides to reconnect with his only daughter Ines, who is now working in Romania. She is on the cusp to get her desired position in the office. On her one final push for that, is now getting distracted by her father. She who never understood her father's way of life, tries to get an answer out of him about the life. So that's where their journey begins. Some of the bold steps taken by them, the film accomplishes what it wanted to tell us in a unique way.

""The problem is it's so often about getting things done. You do this, You do that. And in the meantime, life just passes by.""

The film was actually loosely based by the director's own father. The writing was brilliant. It reminded me 'Infinitely Polar Bear', because these women directors inspired by their fathers to show the world how their childhood was like. The actors were amazing, particularly those two in the main roles. I liked them both equally. From the different angle, they have given different performances. There's no surprise if you liked the film only because of them.

The film had won many prestigious awards around the globe and now its biggest stand off is at the 2017 Oscars which is a few weeks away. Another Scandinavian film, which is also nominated for the Oscar, is also about an old man like this one. But I think 'Under Sandet' is the frontrunner for the golden statue. Because we all know that America's and Academy's sentimental towards the WWII.

When it comes to rating, the film is strictly for adults. It was good in the initial parts, but there are some surprise nude and sex scenes. At that time I thought it lost its path, but actually that was the turning point where you are going to witness a different half of the film. Surely many people going love the second half more than the first.

At first, it looked like it is a German version of 'The Family Fang', but only more realistic with dark humour. It's difficult to understand every scene, especially in the first watch. Because without knowing the film characters, the events involving them look casual. Capable to get the sense of humour is the key here. So if you decide for the second time viewing, you will learn more about it. It is one of those films that second time watch necessary for some people.

Frankly, I did not think it was a great film, just after finish my watch. But thinking back about all those film events, made sense. By the time I decided to write this review, I was in its favour. That's the reason I won't write about the films right away. This is a great film, but you have to focus closely and understand everything, then you will have a great time. But remember, it is one of the longest film in the recent time, particularly for a comedy-drama, yet enjoyable. Recommended!

Billed as a comedy, it is tears-running down-your-face hilarious at certain times, drolly funny elsewhere, slyly satirical at other times, sometimes just plain quirky and even squirmy-uncomfortable in places. It's always interesting, though, and maybe even brilliant. At its core, Toni Erdmann is about core values, both personal and societal; about shifting power relationships in the workplace and within families; and about a father's love for his adult daughter and his struggle to find a way to connect with her. Critics love it, I think, for its subtlety, its unpredictability, and its blending or mashing of genres: comedy, social criticism, family drama, and even a dash of weepy melodrama. Plus, the performances of Peter Simonischek as Winfried/Toni and Sandra Hiller as his daughter, Ines, are sharp and completely believable."

I’m a believer that a protagonist does not have to be likeable, relatable or a good role model. They must be understandable and interesting, and this movie checked all those boxes for me. Josh Gad is also in this movie. He’s really annoying. He plays kind of a Pee Wee Herman-style kids entertainer, but he’s really a big jerk.

The story is also a pretty basic zombie horror-comedy setup and execution, not that different from Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland. Nothing too original going on.

The Final Bill: Zombie comedies have been done before, but this one has Lupita Nyong’o kicking butt and saving children.

-Trip Fontaine

Little Monsters premiered this weekend on Hulu. No, not that Little Monsters – the classic from 1989 starring Fred Savage and Howie Mandel about the monsters that live under the kid’s bed. Little Monsters (2019) is a little bit Shaun of the Dead and a little bit Kindergarten Cop.  Because this movie is already on a streaming device and “time is money”, I will tell you whether it is worth your time to stream Little Monsters.

From the trailer, you might believe that the movie is about a group of students on a field trip that gets overrun by zombies, and it is. It just takes a good 25-30 minutes to get to any of the monster action. We are transported to Australia where slacker, rockstar wannabe, Dave, is having an ongoing argument with his girlfriend. Needless to say, that relationship doesn’t end well such that Dave moves in with his sister and precocious nephew, Felix. Of course, Dave is inept and inappropriate in caring for Felix until he meets Felix’s luminous kindergarten teacher played by, Academy Award winner, Lupita Nyong’o. Eventually, the kindergarten class embarks on a field trip to Pleasant Valley Farm, which is next to a U.S. military base where some unexplained experiment is going on and going wrong. Zombies ensue.

Sure, it is a bit derivative of these other zombie comedies and other movie clichés abound. England’s character is the cliched unreliable uncle. Josh Gad plays a children’s television host, who is not-so-surprisingly less kid friendly off camera. Zombies stalk the set and crave flesh as they are known to do. The biggest savior/revelation for the film is Nyong’o. She sings, she kills zombies and she’s a delightful presence as the kindergarten teacher every 5 year-old should have. It is refreshing to see Nyong’o as the object of affection and a romantic lead here, and she has nice chemistry with England. There are some laughs here and there and some good music, if you’re a Taylor Swift fan especially. The zombies are grotesque-looking, so the makeup was on point. There are some really tense moments where you do not know whether they all will make it.

Ultimately, Little Monsters is not a must see film. If it were in the theater, I’d tell you to skip it. Since it is already on Hulu, it is probably a movie to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon, especially with Halloween coming up, even if it is just to marvel at how remarkably talented Lupita Nyong’o is. I wish she had more starring roles.

Great job, Trip! I must agree but with a caveat for the new parents in the world out there. If this came to theaters, I wouldn’t say completely skip it but it is must definitely a streaming gem. We haven’t seen a movie where toddlers are put in such peril. This movie is basically every new parent’s nightmare! For those of you with a kindergartener, I might say definitely check this out for the Halloween season, even if it’s for zombie apocalypse preparation. And for those of you looking to netflix and chill in this ghastly time of year… definitely check it out."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/little-monsters/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Bertaut1,"Nov 14, 2019",8,"Funny and heart-felt, anchored by another superb Lupita Nyong'o performance

Kind of like a cross between Kindergarten Cop (1990) and Shaun of the Dead (2004), Little Monsters is a hilarious and unexpectedly moving piece of work. The storyline is unquestionably clichéd – a loser who cares only about himself is forced to protect others, realising he's been a **** and must change his ways (with the help **** woman, of course). We've seen this narrative template countless times before. But what's extraordinary about writer/director Abe Forsythe's Little Monsters is that he's able to create likeable characters and elicit genuine emotion from an archetypal structure (the zom-com) that seemed to be in its death throes.

Dave (Alexander England) is a man-child whose life is going nowhere. Unemployed and recently separated from his girlfriend Sara (Nadia Townsend), he moves in with his sister Tess (Kat Stewart) and her son Felix (Diesel La Torraca). Taking Felix to kindergarten one day, Dave meets and becomes infatuated with Felix's teacher, Miss. Caroline (the always radiant Lupita Nyong'o), and when a school trip to Pleasant Valley Farm petting zoo requires an additional chaperone, Dave leaps at the chance. However, an accident at a nearby US army base releases a horde of zombies, and so, trapped in the zoo and determined not to upset the children, Caroline must try to convince them that everything they see is part of an elaborate game.

The thing that struck me most about Little Monsters wasn't the zombies or the comedy, but the emotion; Forsythe never allows the humour to dissipate, constantly tempering the sentimentality. And it's a sentimentality that feels authentic and, more importantly, feels earned. Forsythe, whose son is five and has just started kindergarten, was inspired by his personal experience of anxiety upon handing his child over to a kindergarten teacher, with the zombies introduced later. This is an important point, as they're a means to an end, with no real importance vis-à-vis what the film is trying to say - which is that children can confer strength and, with their uniquely innocent perspective, offer a non-judgmental and often exceptionally perceptive view of the world.

The film's comic structure definitely has a vibe of La vita è bella (1997), with Forsythe getting a lot of mileage out of Caroline trying to keep up the illusion that everything is a game – zombies chasing people is a game of tag; the longer the children all survive, the more levels they will complete in the game; the blood all over Caroline is jam. Even funnier, at one point one of the kids complains because she thinks the zombies look too fake. The film also features one of the best sight gags I've ever seen, involving Dave and a photo of Caroline…or is it? There's also a brilliant scene involving Felix and a Darth Vader outfit, which features him trying to use the Force in a rather awkward situation, later telling Tess, ""I am your father mummy"", a line which made me laugh more than it probably deserved.

In terms of the acting, Nyong'o owns the film – her performance is physical, emotional, authentic, lived-in, and when the time comes, she's fierce and driven, with a real sense of psychological verisimilitude that renders Caroline as a believable, relatable person, complete with human fallibility. She also plays the ukulele for real, has perfect comic timing, and her singing voice is pretty damn good too.

Aside from Nyong'o, the film's other stand-out performance is a wonderfully over the top Josh Gad, playing US children's entertainer Teddy McGiggle. Introduced as a kind of hyperactive but generally affable Mr. Rogers, we soon learn that McGiggle is a cowardly, self-obsessed, alcoholic, sex-addict, who hates children and his comedic companion, a hand puppet named Mr Frogsy. And Gad has a blast digging into this litany of character failings - whether it be tearfully confessing to Dave that he's addicted to sex with single-mothers; drinking hand sanitizer; screaming at zombies, ""I f****d your mother"".

If the film has a problem, it's probably the character of Dave. We're asked to like him from the get-go, but his introductory scenes don't make it easy, as he comes across as a self-important and lazy slob. Of course, that's how he's supposed to come across, as it sets up his redemption arc. Some people, however, will undoubtedly sour to him to the point where that arc seems perfunctory, even cynically fake.

That notwithstanding, Little Monsters is a real gem - rarely have I seen a film so sentimental that avoids becoming turgid. Nyong'o grounds the whole thing, Gad chews the scenery magnificently, and Forsythe nails the comedy/zombie balance. The zom-com subgenre is almost completely in the rearview mirror, but Forsythe has been able to craft an emotionally genuine (and genuinely emotional) film that actually has something to say, and that has tremendous fun saying it."

Its interesting to see the expansion of the character Zac plays in the web series with the talented supporting cast doing a good job with their characters here. Overall the writing is sharp and I got the vibe of watching some sort of british docu-spoof like Alan Patridge and The Office. Its a decent watch although I felt a few more interviews wouldve tilted my score higher....(be warned though some ferns were harmed during the production of this movie)."

This is a movie that knew what it needed to be: a simple wrapper for the skits themselves. The plot is a throwaway, and that's fine. Those involved know it and treat it with the levity in needs, working in quirky, offbeat humor throughout.

The real gems are the interviews, and they come frequently enough, though a few feel too brief. Stay for the credits gag reel to see some of the funniest jokes that were necessarily cut, as no one could keep a straight face (and viewer laughter would make it difficult to follow the entire interview)."

Overall I was pleasantly surprised with Between Two Ferns: The Movie. I was a big fan of the original videos when they came back out several years ago, but had little faith in it as a movie. The celebrity interviews are a mixed bag. While Galifianakis's character gets in some very funny barbs the interview's heavily, if not entirely, scripted feel doesn't shock due to contemporary shows like The Eric Andre Show or Who Is America. Both of which elicit a mostly genuine responses from the guests. Between Two Ferns: The Movie manages to rectify the so-so quality of the interviews by virtue of the supporting cast and Galifianakis's zany and often amusing interactions between the side characters. Other than when Will Ferrell's character was on screen, it felt like he was **** the comedy out of the room, the sub plot of the movie tended to amuse. While not every joke landed enough did and the charisma of the supporting cast and the Galifianakis (or lack there of for him) more than made up for some of these sections clunkiness. Overall Between Two Ferns: The Movie was solidly amusing and much better than I had expected from a Full length Between Two Ferns feature. I'd recommend it to anyone with Netflix needing a light chuckle especially if they're ready to feel the nostalgia when the Between Two Ferns theme plays."

The myriad cameos are the highlight, with Zach's interviews never failing to provoke genuine comedy. The patchwork story surrounding the interviews is boring and predictable however, even with the wonderful Lauren Lapkus giving it her all in a supporting role. Even with its shortcomings, its still one of the funniest movies released in 2019, and an easy recommendation."

They do go on the road to interview celebrities and run into various snags, but it only feigns the depth of a full blown movie, with certain key turning points, while its heart is really in its gags. If you go in knowing what to expect you will be entertained. Think, The Office, where Galfinakis is the Michael Scott character."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-is-true/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"May 24, 2019",8,"As it seems only the British can do, there are 2 scenes in ""All Is True"" that are master classes in acting which would be expected from Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen but a much younger actress, Kathryn Wilder, gives no quarter in being their equal in one of the most important scenes of the movie.

In the particular scene I am referring to William Shakespeare (Branagh), his wife Anne (Dench) and one their daughters Judith (Wilder) are exposing family truths as the screenwriter Ben Elton imagines they would speak yet bringing it in to today's world. When I had time to think about it later I could just imagine a theatre audience seeing it on stage in a play written today and stunning them.

The other scene, between Shakespeare and Henry Wriothesley, the Earl of Southampton, (McKellen) looks into the supposedly love affair between them when both were young men and Shakespeare wrote his sonnets. At one point, without changing a thing, Shakespeare starts talking by reciting one of his sonnets and the Earl recites it back to him. It is as if the two men, not acting, are having a conversation expressing their feelings. Neither sex nor nudity is involved yet you believe you are seeing and hearing both!

While very little is known of Shakespeare's home life, such as the death of his son, Elton presents a plausible story of what may have taken place for the 3 years that Shakespeare returned home to family life after spending most of his life alone in  London at the Globe Theatre which had burned down in 1613.

The only fault, which made it slow moving for only a 100 minute film, is the director's holding on to many unnecessary and lingering nature scenes with the director being Kenneth Branagh.

""All Is True"" might not all be true but it is certainly worth seeing for the acting alone, which shouldn't be but will probably be forgotten at award time."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/judy-punch/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Bertaut1,"Jun 24, 2020",7,"A fascinating socio-political study of proto-feminism mixed with dark comedy

The debut feature from actress turned writer/director Mirrah Foulkes, Judy & Punch is a darkly comic study in proto-feminism, a strange mixture of Monty Python-esque slapstick and serious social critique, wrapping it all up in an anachronistic and pseudo-magical realist aesthetic. It's a mix that shouldn't work, and, for many, it won't - some will find the tonal balance too skewered towards socio-political protest to work as comedy, others will argue the comic elements undermine the socio-political agenda. For me, I thought Foulkes just about got away with it, helped immeasurably by strong performances and a stunning visual design.

In the English countryside town of Seaside (nowhere near the sea), Judy (Mia Wasikowska) and Punch (Damon Herriman) are a young couple with an infant child. The creators of the Punch & Judy puppet show, Judy is by far the more talented puppeteer, but Punch is a natural showman and a master of self-promotion. Although his inability to control his drinking has led to the show's reputation waning, when he hears that a talent-scout is in the area, he determines to curb his drinking. However, when Punch responds to a horrifying accident by viciously beating Judy, she embarks upon a mission of vengeance.

Judy & Punch is, at least in part, another entry in a subgenre we're seeing more and more of in recent years – gynocentric revenge films directed by women; Coralie Fargeat's Revenge and Jennifer Kent's The Nightingale both spring to mind, but you could also include something like Isabella Eklöf's disturbing Holiday, which is a **** drama without the revenge. Given the title, you know from the get-go that the film isn't going to be thematically subtle. Apart from the town's meek constable Derrick (Benedict Hardie) and Scaramouche (Terry Norris), the senile husband of Maude (Brenda Palmer), Judy and Punch's elderly maid, literally every man in the film is a violent misogynistic thug. I don't bring this up by way of criticism, merely to illustrate that the film wears its themes, very proudly, on its sleeve. The Punch & Judy show itself, which invariably involves Punch beating Judy with a stick (itself not exactly a subtle phallic stand-in), has never been especially coy about its own thematic tropes, so why should a film inverting those tropes be otherwise?

One of Judy & Punch's most obvious strengths is the aesthetic, with its lush and vibrant milieu – a realm that's not quite fantasy, not quite historical reality. The town of Seaside, for all its vivid Renaissance-era squalor, is that of a fairy-tale allegory – the kind you'd expect to see terrorised by a werewolf or a giant. Production designer Josephine Ford's work is especially good, and one half-expects to see a gingerbread house in the background.

Enhancing the surreality is the electronic score by François Tétaz, which has no place in a film of this time-period, but which works wonderfully with the stylistic trappings of Foulkes's weird anachronistic vibe. Equally important here is the dialogue, which is a mixture of period-correct diction and a more modern inflection. Put it this way – at one point, we see a group of characters in Renaissance costumes doing tai chi. If that sounds like something you'd find funny, you'll love this exceptionally-realised world.

The acting is universally terrific. Hardie is terrific as the one good man in a town of troublemakers. But unlike the characters played by Clint Eastwood, Derrick has zero authority and no respect. However, despite his ineffectual nature, Hardie plays him as a completely straight-shooter with real interiority. Wasikowska's Judy isn't just a vehicle for feminist rhetoric, but is a capable and fierce woman in her own right. Herriman initially makes Punch seem contemptible, yet as the film goes on, he makes the character even less likeable.

The film does, however, have some problems. For some, it will be too funny to work as feminist critique, and for others, too serious to work as comedy. Others still might argue it works as neither because it never fully commits to either. The narrative and dialogue are also extraordinarily on the nose on occasion. A few of the themes are also under-explored, including domestic violence, which seems to have been included as a plot point simply because it's an issue in the original show – Foulkes never really takes it anywhere.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed Judy & Punch. A statement on oppression and female (re)assertion, it takes the best-known elements of a world-famous puppet show, and inverts them, turning an inherently misogynistic story into a celebration of early feminism. Allegorical in both visual and narrative design, it may be pantomime-esque, but so too is it compelling enough to turn what could have been dismissed as a nasty fairy-tale into a piece of work which is thematically relevant to the milieu in which we now reside."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/doctor-sleep/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DarkwingSchmuck,"Nov 1, 2023",7,"Doctor Sleep is a wildly uneven, but thoughtful sequel to The Shining. Mike Flanagan's adaptation is faithful to a fault to Stephen King's material, while also showing so much reverence for Stanley Kubrick's original film that it's hard for this movie to stand on its own. However, a strong sense of style, solid emotional core, and a wonderfully fun and hammy performance by the very underappreciated Rebecca Ferguson make Doctor Sleep a worthwhile watch for fans of horror, King, and/or Kubrick."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/doctor-sleep/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,FadeBlack,"Apr 14, 2022",7,"Surprisingly a very enjoyable and fun movie. In terms of style and theme it has very little, if anything to do with the Shining, which remains probably the best horror film ever made, but the two can be appreciated separately on their own merits. Doctor Sleep is a bit of an 80's roadtrip horror bash, not to be taken too seriously, borrows a bit of a Lost Boys spirit, and is absolutely worth a watch."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/doctor-sleep/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Dandy-Mr-D,"Dec 7, 2021",8,"Some people do not like this movie because of its connection to the Shining. I've heard some say it's a poor vision for a sequel and that it explains things about the first movie that were better left a mystery. In total, it provides poor synergy when paired with The Shining and it suffers as a result. I actually agree with these statements and it is a bit unfortunate this was to be a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's classic. But if we separate Doctor Sleep from its partner and judge it on its own merits, I think we have a pretty good movie. It's a suspenseful film with moments of painful terror, and it has a cast of interesting and diverse characters that make's for great storytelling. In addition to this, it caused my ""sci-fi meter"" to spike as it had some of the best ideas I've seen in a while when it comes to psychics. So if you are one of those who've heard how terrible this movie is as a sequel to The Shining, you've not heard wrong. But there is still a good movie worth enjoying here and as long as you ignore its sequel status and judge it on its own merits, I think you will find that enjoyment."

The characters have little backstory, save for Matthew **** Koala.
The ensemble fails often, the time spent on all the characters isnt equal, but the result works insofar as a 'Pitch Perfect' movie doesnt HAVE to give every character 15 minutes of fame.
The songs dont HAVE to impress long, just give each their minute or two.
Fluff story, good laughs the first time or two."

The plot I didn't find all that predictable and consider it more than adequate, with a solid premise and well thought out characters. The score and the songs were great. The animation was bright, smooth and on point too.

Having seen Frozen II a few days ago, I certainly enjoyed this one a lot more and thought the songs were much better, even if the animation and effects were not as glamorous as in Frozen, everything else like the characters made up for it. If F II was a 6/7 in my book, this is an easy 9 and am looking forward to the sequel and what they do there!"

Ultimately, ""Sing"" wasn't a huge leap forward from ""The Secret Life of Pets"" thanks to its slightly all-over-the-place story, the somewhat unlikeable protagonist, and the fact that Illumination's trademark humor isn't really on display here. However, I'd be lying if I didn't say that ""Sing"" had some beautiful animation, great music, solid vocal performances, heartwarming moments, and other charming characters that helped keep it afloat. Sure, it's a flawed film, and it won't rank as one of Illumination's best, but ""Sing"" is still an enjoyable entry in the company's filmography, and it's definitely worth giving a shot."

This biopic dramatizes her marriage and early career up to the landmark case that solidified her crusade as an equal rights activist. Even though Felicity Jones does a decent job of bringing out the character's strengths and doubts, the whole thing feels a bit like a Lifetime flick. The relationship with her husband (Armie Hammer) is sweetly romantic and the repetitive discrimination borders on message movie. The story plays out interestingly enough, but as the crucial trail gets closer, the movie's momentum bogs down with legal wrangling.

Bader Ginsburg and how she successfully argued in Federal Court that statutory bias and discrimination based  on a subject’s gender was unconstitutional.

Directed by Mimi Leder with a screenplay written by Justice Ginsburg’s  nephew,

Daniel Stiepelman, the film portrays this dynamic lady as a

crusader for the rights of persons of both sexes and lets the viewer know and understand the tenacity and perseverance of this legal giant. Aptly portrayed by Felicity Jones in the leading role, Ms. Jones  is supported by by Armie Hammer, Sam Waterston and Justin Theroux. Having attended the same law school when Justice Ginsburg studied there, I can personally attest to the very few female law students in attendance  and how extraordinary they had to be in order to gain admission to this restricted legal club .Clearly, Justice Ginsburg is the embodiment of the best of the best of all of them.

With fine, underrated performances by Felicity Jones and Kathy Bates, the film capably walks viewers through the complexities of the legal landscape without resorting to excessive legalese while simultaneously putting a human face on the central issues in question, both in the lives of the protagonist and those for whom she served as advocate. To be sure, the pacing sometimes gets bogged down, and the screenplay tends to unfold in a safe, tried-and-true, somewhat predictable manner. Nevertheless, the inspiration this offering affords and the ideas it champions are well worth the play they get here, something that should prove uplifting to those who seek fairness, equal opportunity and even-handedness in all of their endeavors."

Until one night, when their adult children come into conflict. One commits a murder, the other is a witness, and when one of them ends up dead, the family is torn apart with one on the run and the other on his heels. It honestly took me a while to watch this movie, because I was tired of Liam Neeson and his very particular set of skills, but his character wasn't what I expected. While not having the popularity of Taken, Neeson's performance in this film, was better than any performance he's given in an action film to date. Paired with the ultimate crime boss, Ed Harris, and The Killing's Joel Kinnaman, this movie had a cast that couldn't fail. Watching this compelling story, I couldn't help but think that this would have been an amazing ending for the Sopranos. Run All Night was surprising in the way that it was done, because it wasn't your typical mafia movie, but it wasn't an action film either. The writers very cleverly combined elements of both to combine the thrilling action of a Falling Down, with the crime story of a really good Sopranos episode. The film wasn't just about the incident and the chase and that's why it was special. They even managed to get Law & Order's Vincent D'Onofrio to play the lead detective in the case, and we all know the intensity he can bring to a role. It was a slow start and a somewhat predictable ending, but in the middle, Run All Night was so good, that I could have stayed up and kept watching it all night."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/run-all-night/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"Sep 2, 2015",7,"Neeson is good at it, none other would've played better than him.

Pretty entertaining action flick with a fast paced narration. A typical Liam Neeson's movie. Take a gun and go hunt down the bad guys or protect loved ones from them kind of movie. Under his league, like always he was awesome. This has been a already heard story, like a trivia say. Yes, it was similar to 'Road to Perdition', but happens for a different reason and with the different cast. Still the movie was better that I expected.

I went speechless when I saw Neeson was begging in the opening scene. Because that's not his style, action heroes like him, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis et cetera, they don't fit in those roles. But what came just a few minutes later was like switching to second, third, fourth and fifth gear in a quick session. You know you can't judge a book by its cover, same applies for this as well. The film was good, I mean better than average, better than ratings and reviews across the web.

It was kind of unofficial 'A Man with a Gun' trilogy (I made it up) after 'Unknown' and 'Non-stop'. Because if you check it out all these three film's posters, Neeson will be seen with a gun in the similar fashion. Hope this director and actor comes together to do more movies in the future, since it is a rocking combo. Well, they all might not be the masterpieces, but enjoyable at the time of the watch. Especially it will not disappoint Neeson's fans.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/run-all-night/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TheQuietGamer,"Aug 11, 2015",9,"Jaume Collet-Serra and Liam Neeson's latest collaboration once again shows that a good story can really help to take an action-thriller to new heights. There's a lot going on the plot. Plenty of dialog fleshes out the dark and solemn story, characters, and world. It doesn't skip out on the drama. The movie gives Neeson a chance to flex his acting muscles just as much as his action scene ones.

As far as the action scenes go they are quite tense. Brutal shootouts, a fast car chase, and some hand-to-hand combat all are made to feel fresh thanks to the occasional awesome camera angle. Serra shoots scenes in cool ways here. It helps the action which could have felt overly familiar feel fresh instead.

The entire cast gives fantastic performances. There are quite a few characters here acting from different roles that tie together into one cohesive whole. Usually in Neeson movies it's just him stealing the show. Here though there are other actors to keep your attention. Including particularly cool villains in Ed Harris and rapper ""Common"" (Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr.).

It's a particularly grim action-thriller. Part Taken and part A Walk Among the Tombstones with it's own cool ideas thrown in. The results are one of the more exciting action-thrillers to come out in quite a while. It's a wild ride all the way through that doesn't sacrifice any aspect of it's storytelling. It' a dynamite thriller and one of the best films of 2015.

I give this movie a 9.2/10."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/run-all-night/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MattBrady99,"Apr 30, 2015",7,"Yes I know this review is late but March has been a slow month for me with movies not playing at my location theater, it's a pain in the ass sometimes but hey I finally got a chance to watch it and this is what I have to say about.

The story to Run All Night is about a prolific and aging hitman, Jimmy Conlon, once known as The Gravedigger, has fallen on hard times. With the sins of his past catching up, he finds out his estranged son has been targeted by his former mob boss and must now choose between the crime family he grew up with or the family he left behind.

I think I was like everybody else when I sawed the trailer to Run All Night thinking it was another copy cat of Taken with Liam Neeson playing the same character. With all these movie with Liam Neeson playing pretty much the same character in every movie his in is getting a bit old now and his movies now I would call them The Liam Neeson film with action and bullets flying everywhere. Now I don't hate Liam Neeson I actually freaking love the guy he's awesome and his really funny when his mad.

After the long search for this movie and finally viewing it I was actually surprise that this wasn't another Taken movie and more of a movie that can stand on it's own feet as a revenge thriller with a lot of good things in it.

Liam Nesson in this movie isn't just playing himself this time, he's actually got a character ark in this movie and his character isn't all perfect but more damage and understandable. Liam Nesson did a great performance showing all the pain and sadness from his character and Liam nailed it because well this shows you that Liam **** a great actor. Liam Nesson character is the kind of character that I think we all can relate to when he isn't perfect but he's trying his hardest to make things right but it doesn't quite work out, we had that in are life's and it may not happened to you yet but it will do sooner or late, and as I said before Liam pulled it off excellently.

Ed Harris was also great in this movie as he added a lot to his character just like Nesson. I think Liam Nesson and Ed Harris back and forward with each other and how both of them stare each other down, **** talking to each other and ready to attack and the movie took a whole scene to show that and it was like art house brilliant for two characters who are both damage to bounce off each other with their emotions really made one heck of a show.

The directing of the movie I thought did a great job directing characters and actions scenes. The writing in the movie that can be cliche at times but still has some bad-ass lines that will crack a smile on your face or leave you in silence.

The title of the movie doesn't lie at all, the movie is literally set on one night and everyone is always moving around and nobody get's a break everything's always moving. This is what action movie plot should be like and Run All Night gives you that plot that isn't stupid but more creative for what they had.

Now for problems I do have some like: There are so many things going on in this movie with the cops, mob bosses, drug dealers, Ed Harris, Liam Nesson mid life crisis and may god these so many things happening and it feels a bit crushed together at time for how many things they wanted to show.

But overall I had a good time watching Run All Night and I was surprise how it didn't turn into the cliche Liam Nesson action movie that's trying way to hard to be Taken. The movie actually had character ark, a good story to it and a solid cast and actors that pulled **** performance in this surprisingly good movie."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/run-all-night/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Arthur_S_Poe,"Apr 19, 2015",8,"'Run All Night', although very similar to Neeson's 'Taken' trilogy, offers an interesting action/drama/thriller blend that will surely keep your attention for the duration of the movie. Unlike the 'Taken' trilogy, where Neeson actually carried the whole movie himself, here we have the excellent Ed Harris, whose character takes a big chunk of the weight off of Neeson, although he is still the main focus of the movie.

With a touch of aesthetically crafted details and scenes, 'Run All Night' offers both drama and action, a touching and thrilling story with classical action film elements. Although the latter causes a visible lack of originality plot-wise and a series of (stereo)typical elements, the former is so powerfully crafted that you're actually able to disregard the majority of those elements.

Certainly, although you'll be able to predict the ending quite early on, 'Run All Night' is a movie worth watching, because of Neeson and Harris, if nothing else. Cheers!"

The latest Keanu Reeves movie John Wick, which just came out a few months ago, had the exact same plot.  It was also somewhat annoying that at the beginning of this film Liam Neeson plays a washed up, drunken ex-hit man who can barely function, yet when the action starts he suddenly transforms into a sober fighting machine that can beat up anyone.

After just only 2 months here we go again with a new Liam Neeson movie ""Run All Night "" which makes me feels like i don't know what to expected from this movie since like i said before Taken 3 is terrible and the movie trailer feels boring and repetitive.

But after i saw this movie i really think there's still hope in Liam Neeson movie with Run All Night being this good.

The most surprising thing in this movie for me is the script is actually really good Brad Inglesby used the relationship between father and son in the movie and tie it to the main conflict of the movie really well.

Also the 2 main characters which is Liam Neeson and Ed Harris characters are so good that just make watching them try to kill / revenge each other fun to watch.

The Director Jaume Collet-Serra is pretty good in this movie too , with his fun and exciting storytelling , although i wish he use the ""Survive in One Night"" theme more because right now i just don't feel like the movie have to use that theme at all.

Overall Run All Night is a good action movie with good action scene , great characters and the movie always know what it want to tell , which is how much father love their son , even their son is totally a terrible person they still love them and will do anything to help them."

However, it's a little dark for my tastes, though less so than Walk Among The Tombstones thankfully. I'm a ""good guys must always win"" type and don't like seeing good guys die indiscriminately, even if lots of bad guys die too unless it means something.  If you like Neeson movies in general, than you will likely enjoy this one.   If darkness doesn't bother you, than you will probably like it a lot."

The movie has a fairly strong cast composed of Neeson, Ed Harris, Joel Kinnaman and several other strong actors in the supporting cast like Vincent D'Onofrio and Common. Run All Night is a action film that is as classic as they come. Neeson is a character you generally care about and he is vulnerable at points in the movie where in the last installments in the Taken series it seemed as if he was invincible. Ed Harris also has a strong performance in the film and its nice to see him as the evil one as it seems like he is normally a good guy in most cases. However, one of may problems with the film is that there are two many important players in the film. You get the  Mafia, the police, and an assassin all at once and although that's pretty cool there are points where it seems like it too much. Still its well worth checking out and its a rare March theatre gem. If you are a fan of action movies this movie is a safe bet."

In fact, BJB felt very relevant and up-to-date both in 2016 and in todays world. The story may seem a little unrealistic - two potential fathers who both fight to stay in Bridget and baby’s life - but this does provide the heart of the film and it is a storyline which is 100% worthy for a Bridget Jones movie. 
The script, much like the first film, is witty, engaging and so, so funny. BJB leaves you feeling warm inside while also laughing so hard you may feel something warm running down your leg (🫣). Much different than the first two films, this rom-com revolves around a trio of middle-aged actors and it is all the better for it! Not only does it give a sense of nostalgia, but it gave the franchise a great boost having an instalment set in the 2010’s. I, for one, was able to catch my first Bridget film in the cinema which was a truly special moment for me. I’m sure this was the same for others. 
Emma Thompson is a welcome, and very comical, addition to the ever-growing supporting cast. She stole the show in every single scene she had. I loved her character! As always, Renée Zellweger is outstanding, I literally have no notes because she is perfect as Bridget. The only thing I will note is that, obviously, Hugh Grant did not return for this film and his departure is felt! Bridget with Mark vs Bridget with Daniel worked so well because there was evident chemistry between both pairs. Newcomer Patrick Dempsey did struggle in this area. Thier chemistry was nowhere near the level shared between Zellweger and Colin Firth."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/bridget-joness-baby/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"Dec 24, 2016",7,"This is a two-man job!

Unlike the first two films, this was not based on the book. Instead, it is an original screenplay that fills the gap between the second and the third book. So reading the third book before watching this film is a spoiler. Most importantly the fourth film is on, only officially have to be announced.

The original director returned to this, but I appreciate the story and the screenplay and people behind it. I did not think this sequel would work, but it exceeded my expectation. A simple story and very familiar settings, but developed so well. There's no Bridget's diary in this, instead an iPad.

Renee Zellweger was totally unrecognisable. Actually, I said that in my 'The Whole Truth' review. But she was good to return as Bridget. Colin Firth looks too older than his actual age, but was great in his part. No Hugh Grant, but a new competitor was introduced which is none other than Patrick Dempsey.

This is not the same kind of narration that we saw a decade ago. Because all the characters are aged, so according to the situation this story takes place. It's a two hour long film, but it had some good jokes. Those who enjoyed the first two would surely enjoy it as well. So choosing it to watch is not a bad idea.

7/10"
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/bridget-joness-baby/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,madmovieman,"Nov 29, 2016",7,"There are few films that irritate me more than the original Bridget Jones’ Diary, and its sequel. Annoying, cheesy and dumb, I never found much enjoyment in them at all, which is the main reason why I was so surprised to like Bridget Jones’ Baby so much. Finally giving the character a likable and interesting persona, whilst also delivering comedy and romance in a confident and fresh way, fortunately moving away from the repetitive first two films, this is by far the best film of the whole series.

To start off, I think the most important reason this film is so enjoyable is because it’s totally different to the first two films. As much as I didn’t like them, I recognise a large audience did. However, 13 years later, it would have been insane to churn out the same formula once again, but I was delighted to see that director Sharon Maguire and writer Helen Fielding managed to provide a different experience.

With Bridget’s now more ‘mature’ and confident persona, this film doesn’t try to be another Pride And Prejudice parody full of awkward slips and mishaps. Yes, there are still a good few clumsy moments, but that’s a part of Bridget’s nature that even I wouldn’t want to see disappear completely, but what this film does so well is manage the balance between idiotic comedy and a genuinely engaging story, making for a far more entertaining watch that allows you to both laugh and get engrossed in Bridget’s various adventures.

One more positive that comes from the story here is that it’s not as insanely focused on Bridget Jones alone. Whilst she’s of course still the main character, a lot of this film is actually dedicated to the characters played by Patrick Dempsey and Colin Firth, both of whom provide excellent comic relief, a different dynamic to Hugh Grant’s bad-boy vibe from the first two films, and an occasional welcome break from Bridget’s inner monologue, which is yet another point that makes this film not only more bearable than the first two, but far more well-rounded and genuinely interesting.

Finally, we can’t ignore Renée Zellweger’s performance here. Along with her character’s maturing, Zellweger gives a far more likable and reasonable performance, making Bridget so much more tolerable than before. Although she was never a huge issue in the first two films, seeing Bridget actually act like an adult throughout, rather than a third edition **** 12 year old girl, was very refreshing, and definitely made her character a lot more accessible and interesting for me.

Overall, I was really surprised by Bridget Jones’ Baby. It’s not only a funnier and more enjoyable watch than its two predecessors, but a welcome evolution for the series, taking Bridget’s ridiculous mishaps down a notch by providing more interesting storytelling, characters and romance, whilst also featuring some of the best acting and directing of the trilogy."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/elvis-nixon/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,FilipeNeto,"Jan 15, 2021",9,"This was one of the films I saw at the last New Year's Eve, and it was a pleasant surprise, considering that I was not particularly impressed with the synopsis I had read about it. The strong point of the film is the simple fact that it is based, obviously in a very distorted way, on a meeting that really took place between Elvis Presley, one of the most notable music artists ever, and the American President Richard Nixon, remembered by American history for the worst reasons, usually, given that he was one of the few presidents to step down to avoid being forced out from office.

The script is good, and adapts perfectly to a short film like this. In fact, almost everything happens only during one day of the singer's life, who, distressed by drug abuse by young people, decides to collaborate with the authorities as a plain clothed federal agent, secretly, in order to combat the abuses of youth who, for him, corrupted America. Nixon is not a kind of man who adheres to fashions or wants to be with singers, and will naturally pose several objections to the meeting, but he will be overcome by his daughter, who is an Elvis fan.

The cast is as small as the film, but it has a great performance by Kevin Spacey, an actor that I usually don't usually appreciate very much but who did an excellent job as the president. Michael Shannon is an actor I didn't know, I don't remember any of his films, but I think he did an interesting job in the role of Elvis, although I have my doubts about how strict he was in the way he portrayed the King. Obviously, the scenes with the White House advisers stank of comic satire and I don't believe they happened that way. Alex Pettyfer, Colin Hanks and Evan Peters play the secondary roles with dignity and commitment, the latter two with a strong comic streak.

Technically, it is a pleasant film, which entertains and flows smoothly until the end, with good doses of humor and very inspired and colorful dialogues. It has a pleasant cinematography and the costumes make good use of the clothes and fashion of that time. The sets, in turn, are not so visibly dated, but they fit perfectly. The soundtrack is very good and uses iconic songs like ""Hold On, I'm Comming"" by Sam and Dave, or ""Suzy Q"", by Creedence Clearwater Revival, functioning as a true potpourri of the best music of the early Seventies."

Der Superstar schreibt einen Brief an den amtierenden US-Präsidenten ­– mit der blauäugigen Bitte, als Undercoveragent für Recht und Ordnung zu sorgen. Ein Treffen findet tatsächlich statt, das daraus resultierende Foto geht in die Geschichte ein. Um viel mehr geht es nicht in Liza Johnsons Film, kein politischer Ballast drückt die Stimmung der seichten, dafür doppelt charmanten Komödie. Das ist aber auch nicht schlimm – denn Kevin Spacey als grummeliger Nixon ist zum Schießen, Michael Shannon gibt souverän den leicht melancholischen King. Elvis & Nixon zeigt die wohl populärsten Personen seiner Zeit somit als Alltagsmenschen – wodurch der Film dann doch unerwartetes Terrain erschließt."

It made me search more info about this strange meeting."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/elvis-nixon/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Spangle,"Nov 6, 2016",7,"Elvis & Nixon may not be the most challenging piece of cinema ever released, but it is a very one. With two terrific lead actors in Michael Shannon and Kevin Spacey, Elvis & Nixon is based on a single image of Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon in the White House. The rest rises out of an imagined reason for the meeting. In doing so, the film manages to delve into both Elvis and Nixon as people, serving as an interesting look at both of them, even if the story itself is not really true. However, what it lacks in truth, it makes up for with comedy. A smart and witty film, Elvis & Nixon is incredibly well-written as a comedy with lots of little references to real events and outright jokes. The end result of all of this is truly enjoyable hour and a half.

As Elvis, Michael Shannon is loud, boisterous, and magnanimous. However, he does not shy away from the internal struggles facing Elvis and the status of being a celebrity. Though far from unique in this, the film does a good job to evoke feelings of sympathy for ""The King"". Remaining deified to this very day, he is rarely looked at as a person and the film does a good job to make us feel for him on a personal level. He is not just some kooky rock star who wants to be a federal agent, he is a real person and nobody ever gives him that time of day. Shannon's performance is truly magnetic and really carries the film on his shoulders.

As Nixon, Kevin Spacey is equally terrific. Though a lot of it is reminiscent of Frank Underwood in House of Cards, his Nixon feels quite accurate and stoic. Watching his transformation from when he is first told about Elvis wanting to meet him to when he actually meets him is quite comical. Yet, Spacey makes it feel authentic and really captures that ""not cool but want to be cool"" essence that many people have, especially when in the presence of somebody cool. Spacey's turn here also provides many laughs, especially at the end when he is twirling the gun. There is a certain simplicity to the style of comedy in the film and Nixon captures most of the best lines in this one, with Spacey making the most of it with good delivery and timing.

However, in saying this, while the film is quite funny and a good look at both of its real life protagonists, Elvis & Nixon is an incredibly slight film. Coming in at just an hour and a half, Elvis & Nixon is largely just focused on this meeting and setting it up, while pretending to develop of a background relationship/issue for Jerry Schilling (Alex Pettyfer), who is an associate and friend of Elvis. It can certainly drag as you just want them to get to the meeting. The romance background, which is barely looked at, is clearly there to just add some further dimension to the film, but even with that here, Elvis & Nixon rarely makes the case for being a feature-length film. While I did really enjoy my time with it, it probably would have been even better as a short film (40-50 minutes in length maybe), allowing it to be more focused on the photograph and meeting, rather than adding fluff to make it longer.

As a whole, Elvis & Nixon is a very funny film that may be a little too long for its story, but thanks to Shannon's Presley and Spacey's Nixon, the film is incredibly easy to watch."

Really don't want to say too much because the movie was so much fun to watch and laugh.  I will say though: Favorite scene - Tina on Adderalll doing her strip-tease dance. Hilarious.  Watch and enjoy!"

Embora não seja o filme mais inovador da Pixar, ele compensa com uma ótima mensagem sobre legado e a importância de passar adiante o conhecimento. O desfecho, com McQueen assumindo um novo papel e Cruz vencendo a corrida, é satisfatório e fecha bem o arco dos personagens.Nota: 8.7/10 - Muito Bom"

I will sum it up like this.. it was fabulous to see old friends on the screen and I smiled and laughed.. but with any TV SHOW turned MOVIE.. for example.. Sex and the City... both shows were excellent on TV.. and both made for good MOVIES.. but it does not hold the same Quirkiness, Quick and or Constant Nonsense of what makes the show a show.. but its so nice to have two full hours with your favorite characters who do it so well.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/max-steel/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,bernool,"Nov 19, 2022",10,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and the 23rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts, written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Zendaya, Cobie Smulders, Jon Favreau, J. B. Smoove, Jacob Batalon, Martin Starr, Marisa Tomei, and Jake Gyllenhaal. In the film, Parker is recruited by Nick Fury (Jackson) and Mysterio (Gyllenhaal) to face the Elementals while he is on a school trip to Europe.

Discussions for a sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming began by October 2016, and the project was confirmed later that year. Holland, Watts, and the writers were all set to return by the end of 2017. In 2018, Jackson and Gyllenhaal joined the cast as Fury and Mysterio, respectively. Holland revealed the sequel's title ahead of filming, which began that July and took place in England, the Czech Republic, Italy, and the New York metropolitan area. Production wrapped in October 2018. The marketing campaign is one of the most expensive for a film ever and attempted to avoid revealing spoilers for Avengers: Endgame prior to its April 2019 release.

Spider-Man: Far From Home premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre on June 26, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 2, as the last film in Phase Three of the MCU. The film received positive reviews with praise for its humor, action sequences, visuals, and the performances of Holland and Gyllenhaal. It grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the first Spider-Man film to pass the billion-dollar mark, the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2019, and became Sony Pictures' highest-grossing film and the 24th-highest-grossing film of all time. A sequel, Spider-Man: No Way Home, was released in December 2021."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/max-steel/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TheQuietGamer,"Sep 4, 2017",7,"With two animated TV series already under their belt, Mattel tries their hand at bringing their long-running action figure line into live-action form on the big-screen. Based on the 2013 reimagining series that ran on Disney XD, ""Max Steel"" is another entry in the ever-growing superhero film market that is currently being dominated by the comic book bigshots Marvel and DC. Max Steel is an admirable attempt at getting another series going, but was ultimately doomed to be DOA due to the fact that it's a more obscure character and clearly just didn't have the flash or history of it's competition. That's not to say it's all bad though. In fact, Max Steel can be quite entertaining. It's just that a reliance on formula holds it back. It's pretty much your standard superhero origin story. You can see bits of Raimi's Spider-Man as Max McGrath plays around with his newly discovered powers, the plot itself is derivative of those two Amazing Spider-Man movies, and the villain feels like he was pulled straight from 2008's Iron Man. It's a hodgepodge of borrowed ideas tied together with the character's own original lore, which I must say is surprisingly well-handled in that you get an answer to all your questions by the end of the film. Further explanation as to the reasoning behind those explanations, like what actually causes Max's weird powers in the first place isn't something the movie gets into. Oh, so he's filled with Tachyon energy. Why? Because aliens? Okay I guess. The writing is just lacking a little something needed to stand up amongst it's very successful peers.

The action scenes in the movie are fine and the characters themselves are pretty likable. Even believable. Particularly Max himself. Ben Winchell does a great job in the lead role. The dialog itself is surprisingly great as well. The interactions between characters feel real right up until some cheesy dialog during the final showdown. It's this kind of stuff that kept me engaged and entertained even though the movie isn't exactly the next great superhero epic. Even Max's personal dramas of loneliness and an absent father are relatable in a way that this year's Power Ranger's movie was. Luckily, this movie is much better in the action department. The humorous dialog from Josh Brener as ""Steel"" is also much appreciated.

Overall, Max Steel isn't as bad as a lot of movie based on toys have been. It by no means soars to new heights, but can at least prove to be a suitable way to pass the time between the next Marvel and DC film if you really find yourself needing your superhero fix. It should come as no surprise though that the real audience for this movie are the kids who enjoyed the Disney XD show. They'll have a blast watching their once animated hero brought to life in live-action form in his own feature film. Parents and older siblings might even find themselves enjoying it too. So long as they go this knowing it isn't a real standout in any way."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-tax-collector/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LegendaryKirin,"Aug 11, 2020",8,"This film depicts an old style of chicano culture found through LA, with families associated with gangs or the cartel. Most Meta reviewers are Caucasians that think right off the bat think that the film is racist and full of stereotypes, but have no idea what it was like living in the ghetto or the projects in California. From La to Oakland drugs, money, and violence has plagued the streets, but nothing matches to what the cartel or Mexican, Hispanic, Chicano gangs are capable of and this film shows that true darkside of it all. Images that you only could find on bestgore rides through this movie keeping focused on every character especially Shia LaBeouf's. Kreeper is just a straight up sicario and just by watching his character you can feel the natural psycho extert off Shia and realize why Hollywood won't give him roles anymore and its just because he makes it feel too really. The gruesomeness throughout film just reminds you of what Mexico deals with on the regular and could not imagine this happening today in California since it takes place in the ghettos of LA. But the movie did fall short with feeling rushed kind of loosing character development and moving so quick that it felt like you missed so much from the main characters that weren't kreeper. But the film was overall enjoyable and not the worst thing that has been released this year and can find yourself relating to the film if you grew around the a ghetto area because thats the only way you'd figure out if they just straight stereotyped everyone in the film which they did not because the main characters wife works for a large company and is actually the smart one since she handles the accounts or if thats really how they act at times. The film could have been better, but i was glad to see something realistic instead of a special effects film that makes no sense for once. So all and all I recommend this film much more than anything Netflix is making at the moment."

However, if you are a unbeliever, you will either hate it or become a christian, there is no other way around it. The gospel message inside this very will made and performed flick is so powerful that it is impossible to see it with a impartial mind. If you are born again, you will cry tears of joy multiple times, if you hate God, you´re going to hate everything about this movie. It is a landmark in spiritual cinema and should be watched by everyone that knows the Lord."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/gods-not-dead-2/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MrGreenTurtle,"Apr 25, 2016",9,"is is an encouraging movie. It expresses the faithfulness of God, and the real hope found in the name of our savior. Atheists may not like it, but this is a very good representation of their aggression and anger towards Christians every day. It even goes as far as to prove the existence of the man named Jesus (whether or not someone is willing to believe that he is the son of God is another story). Yet, their responses to our faith are understandable, being as the existence ****, and the right to believe in one stands in the way of their awful agendas.  

Man loves darkness, and therefore his works are evil. Light and darkness cannot truly coexist (one will always try to snuff out the other) and God's Not Dead 2 portrays this concept perfectly. The world's persecution of Christians is only going to get worse as time presses on, and one day soon we are going to be forced to make a very hard choice, very much like the main character: Grace Wesley. Do we stand with God and lose everything - maybe even our lives, that we may have life more abundantly in heaven, or do we abandon him for the fleeting, disintegrating lusts of the flesh? Do we let fear of man overthrow our hearts, or the unconditional love of God fill us with overflowing peace and rest in the face of darkness?  

This movie will remind us that we can trust God even when life gets dark. We stand together as the children of God, born again through Jesus' ultimate sacrifice for our sins and we are part of his kingdom. But we need to press in to Christ and let him present his goodness to us in all things. Ask and we will be given, knock and the doors will be opened to us. If we hunger and thirst in the spirit, we will be filled with the bread of life and given living water. Everything we will ever need (physically & spiritually) will be found through resting in God's love. We need to keep our focus on Jesus, lest we sink in the midst of a storm - for storms are coming. But God's love for us all is unmeasurable and he will never leave, nor forsake us. He is always there right beside us, and that is what I got from God's Not Dead 2.

Final Thoughts: If you are a born again believer, this movie will lift you up! I always find it amusing that whenever a great christian movie is released to the public, a parade of Atheists attack it with a storm of hateful reviews. As Christians, we don't send a renegade of nasty reviews everytime a hollywood classic comes out, simply because it doesn't agree with our bible or line up with our spiritual beliefs. It doesn't bother us because we're looking to the light-and the light completely over powers the darkness. Yet, to those living in the darkness, a movie like God's Not Dead 2 shines so brightly on them, that all they can do is try and push it back. It really just goes to show how real of an enemy we actually deal with.

Atheists don't realize it, but the devil uses them like pawns in an obvious attempt to steer believers away from receiving the messages of true Christian movies. He knows the power and effect that they could have in our hearts or in our lives. Infact, the nasty reviews I saw attatched to the first God's Not Dead was the very reason I almost never watched it at all. But a friend later recommended it to me and my parents even asked if I wanted to watch it with them, so I obliged. And afterwards I felt encouraged and desiring a deeper relationship with Jesus. It was an excellent Christian movie, and the sequel is a powerful addition.

Pay absolutely no attention to a single atheist opinion of this title. Don't let them steal the healing message that God has for you here. At the same time, if you are a christian just looking to be entertained, you may still miss the true point of God's Not Dead 2. But if you are looking for an honest word from the heart of God then I can promise that you will not find disappointment. God bless!"
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/gods-not-dead-2/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TheQuietGamer,"Apr 8, 2016",7,"The first ""God's Not Dead"" tried to uplift Christians and convict nonbelievers. The latter of which it largely failed to do thanks to it's awkward nature and a rather harsh depiction of the very people it tried to minister to. For the sequel that issue has been avoided. This time around the focus is solely on entertaining a Christian audience while delivering a message to said Christians with little to no preaching at nonbelievers. As a result it's a better film in several ways.

That's not to say all of the issues from the previous movie have been fixed. It still suffers from awkward moments, pacing, and writing early on before the actual case takes place. The side-plots do a better job this time around of connecting back to the main conflict, but still feel underdeveloped.

As for the movie's message it's all about standing strong in your faith. The court room drama aspect of the film is all about showing ways to defend our views. It's strategies are defense, but somehow the message is offense. There's a bit of a clash there as the film keeps saying ""we're at war"" and ""we need to fight back,"" but it's constantly playing defense. It's telling us to get ahead of the game, but is having it's characters sit back and wait the fight to come to them. The film has a conflict with it's conflict.

God's Not Dead 2 manages to avoid some of the shortcoming of it's predecessor, but adopts some of it's own along the way. Overall though I can't help but feel that it's a better movie seeing as how it almost solely focuses on entertaining Christians, the only audience who will appreciate it anyway. There is perhaps some pandering at times, but overall this is a movie that built around pleasing it's expected audience. No more, no less.

As a result if you aren't of the faith then I can't recommend it. Especially if you didn't enjoy the first. It's got it's issues and really only Christians are going to put up with them. As a Christian I can say that I enjoyed the new direction and was completely aware that this was built from the ground up to please me. It didn't always succeed, but I enjoyed the overall movie. So for Christians, yeah go watch it. For nonbelievers, this isn't something you'll enjoy in the slightest. At least not without a sense of curiosity, forgiveness, and an open-mind."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/blumhouses-fantasy-island/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Davrosdaleks1,"Feb 16, 2020",7,"Fantasy Island, based on the 70's TV show, takes the concept of the original, an island where your dreams come true, and adds a dark twist to the proceedings as a group of visitors find their dreams becoming nightmares. I know making a different genre out of a show whose star has faded may seem like an odd choice, but they did make two successful comedies based on 21 Jump Street. Plus the nice thing about working with a property that the newer generation was never familiar with is that you get leeway with creative changes. (Note to self: work on script for Petticoat Junction political thriller.) I don't think this is perfect, but it is an interesting watch.

This actually honors the feel of the original far more than the commercials made me thought it was going to. A good part of the beginning and middle is looking at the characters' fantasies before anything goes crazy. (This PG-13 film is kind of more a dark fantasy than full horror.) All the characters have their personal conflicts and lessons. Each fantasy is distinct and I found them all rather interesting. There were a lot more twist and turns than I'd anticipated.

Though there was a lot I liked about this, it could've been better. It's one of those cases where the director/writers had good ideas and came from a positive place but couldn't reach their full potential. The dialogue is often basic or just weak. The actors aren't able to do much with it. We're talking about a cast with experience too, not a bunch of newbies. Pretty Little Liars' Lucy Hale particularly fumbles and Michael Pena as Mr. Roarke, the one running the island, is hit-and-miss.

A lot of people are downright hating this movie. I think that's bit much. Personally, I think it'so-so at worst. I think it's worth your risk seeing it at some point. It feels a little different than most films."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/geostorm/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TheQuietGamer,"Feb 16, 2018",7,"When it comes to recent disaster flicks, ""Geostorm"" is better than San Andreas, but is no Into the Storm. It's combination of silly sci-fi elements and political thriller plot is what keeps the movie going when cities aren't being reduced to rubble by monstrous weather anomalies. It's predictable for sure and the destruction itself is brought to life by some visuals that are slightly below par (the lightning is outright laughable). Yet, even with it's dopey plotting there's still some suitable entertainment to be found in a turn your brain off sort of way.

Outside **** plot hole the biggest issue with the story is the amount of clichéd family drama. The characters are of the cookie cutter variety and rather than focusing on the more effective form of emotional manipulation by delivering more moments between the main character and his daughter, Geostorm places it's emphasis on the sibling rivalry side of things. Some that is hindered greatly by Jim Sturgess' absolute twerp of a character. He is the definitive boogerhead little brother, complete with bad haircut. The dialog in this film is humorously bad at times. There are moments so stupid that you can't help but have fun with them. Part space adventure and part nature-fueled destruction fest, Geostorm can provide a good time if you can appreciate some cinema trash. It's a Gerard Butler movie for crying out loud. If you were expecting anything more than a dumb popcorn flick then you're an idiot. Only not the kind that will be able to appreciate Geostorm's surprisingly fun combination of the familiar and the ridiculous with a dash of good intentions that's all delivered with a straight face when it needs to be, but has no problem showing off it's silly side (like it had a choice)."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/geostorm/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,KaptenVideo,"Dec 28, 2017",8,"No matter how fine their taste, I believe that anybody can enjoy an occasional B-movie now and then. The opinions differ only on what makes a good one.

The president of the USA, far-reaching conspiracy, the world in danger, a few good (wo)men doing what is right, impending big disaster – if these keywords fit your cup of B, then „Geostorm“ may have what it takes to entertain you for 109 minutes and leave a good aftertaste.

When the network of satellites designed to control the global climate starts to attack the planet instead, it's a race against the clock to uncover the real threat before a worldwide geostorm wipes out everything and everyone.

Most of the story actually takes place in space, so considerable part of the visual effects budget has been spent to show us the International Space Station, satellites and the big cold void that we like to call the universe. And after having your fill of „cosmos porn“, there are big natural disaster scenes to fall back on.

The disasters dominate the promoting materials but are actually in minority, and mostly mercifully short. They look awesome but are not essential to the story and thus tend to even somewhat disrupt the general atmosphere and flow. Especially near finale, which is mercifully short too. Because good entertainment should always know when to end and not stretch over two hours or something.

Starring Gerard Butler – the unsung hero and go-to guy to any self-respecting B- or generic movie – who is joined by a surprisingly large and impressive cast including Jim Sturgess, Abbie Cornish, Talitha Eliana Bateman, Adepero Oduye, Ed Harris, Andy Garcia, Alexandra Maria Lara, Daniel Wu, Eugenio Derbez, and Amr Waked.

It’s also worth noting that almost all major female characters are written as strong individuals and don’t rely on their looks (although they do look good of course).

This approach is something that freshens and updates the general vibe reminiscent of the big dumb 1990’s movie that the director and co-writer Dean Devlin became really famous for originally, meaning „Independence Day“. Back then, of course, he was just a writer and co-creator with Roland Emmerich, here he debuts as director too.

But cool actors, strong female characters and even big-budget special effects will only get you so far, when the movie is lacking the most essential of elements: heart.

And „Geostorm“ has a lot of heart, which is the main reason I liked and enjoyed it so much – in spite of its weak storytelling where things mainly happen because they are ought to, not develop naturally.

It’s a minor miracle that despite all the unrealistic-ness and cheesiness of the story – it's a B-movie, after all – the actors are so spot on, full of heart and conviction that you just have to buy all this what’s happening on screen.

This is probably thanks to Devlin’s brilliance at putting together this kind of big cheesy thing. It was about time he started directing too!

Leading star Gerard Butler, in some movies just a poor man’s Aaron Eckhart, is in especially good form, a shining example of how to breathe life into otherwise generic material, and grab us along with the ride.

If you think that spouting all these silly lines and making it feel believable must be easy, as it seems for him, then you should try acting for youself.

In a way, his charismatic work here feels as much an achievement as Matthew McConaughey’s in „Interstellar“ which is actually not the weirdest association if one was to compare the central themes of the two movies. But if this comparision seems too out-there, there are also parallels with many apocalyptic blockbusters from „Armageddon“ to „The Day After Tomorrow“.

So… I liked it. „Geostorm“ is certainly cheesy, but it does what it does really well. Go catch this!"

I prefer seeing a bad person doing good to restore my faith in humans. Either way, it’s always intersting to see how to change actions that affect people badly. Our reason to see this movie, despite the critics, was for the imaginative scientific premise. We got what we paid for.

Yes it has some dumb moments and scenes, but overall it isn't too cringy or anything. But maybe that's just me as I really like Aubrey Plaza and that's why I liked the movie :D"
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GentM2015,"May 23, 2016",8,"Dirty Grandpa is a comedy film directed by Dan Mazer and written by John Philips. The film stars Robert De Niro, Zac Efron, Zoey Deutch and Aubrey Plaza.
After Jason's grandmother dies and just before his marriage, his grandfather asks him to go on a road trip to Daytona Beach, Fla., and there's where Jason learns a couple of lessons from his ""dirty grandpa"".
I found this movie really funny most of the time and I couldn't stop laughing at a lot of the jokes. I suppose that a lot of these negative reviews for this movie are from people who think that this movie is against their ""morals"". But it doesn't really matter, cause Dirty Grandpa has been a box office success and a lot of people liked it, including me.
Zac Efron is really funny, he has shown that he's got comedic guts over and over again. I am becoming a fan of as I keep on seeing him in these kind of movies .
Robert De Niro is also awesome on the role all throughout. I also really liked the supporting characters, especially Jason Mantzoukas as a drug dealer who had me laughing every time he was on screen.
Sure this movie isn't nowhere near a comedic masterpiece and nor is it trying to be. It is a fun ride from beginning to end, and despite all the cliches, the jokes are what make this ride worth it."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Tss5078,"Feb 18, 2016",8,"Upon reading other reviews for this film, I've seen people say things like, ""has Robert De Niro lost his mind?"" and ""you know you're pretty desperate for work when you start ripping off Johnny Knoxville."" It is for this reason, that people are staying away from this film, and they are making a big mistake, here's why. At 73, with over one hundred films under his belt, is it really that surprising that Robert De Niro is bored and looking to try something new? In reviewing his credits, he's never been in what one would call a raunchy comedy, and for it what it's worth, he was outstanding. De Niro plays a man who has just lost his wife of fifty year, and is looking to reconnect with his Grandson, and of course get laid. After tricking his Grandson into taking him to Florida, the two wind up at Spring Break in South Beach, where the hilarity begins. De Niro's grandson is played by Zac Efron, who took a while to lose the teen idol label and find his niche as the awkward, but lovable guy in these extreme comedies. Their two characters are so different, that just bringing the personalities together is enough to make things funny, but when you throw them into ridiculous situations together the laughter is off the charts. Personally, I am someone who has found some of the most classic comedies of all time to be a waste of time. Humor is something I enjoy, but not something that I understand easily, and I found Dirty Grandpa to be one of the funniest films, I've ever seen. You will not believe just how raunchy it gets or the lengths De Niro is prepared to go to in order to get some good laughs at his age. I too was thinking this film would be ""okay"" at best, but I was wrong, and so are my fellow critics. Dirty Grandpa is hysterical and those who are avoiding it due to bad reviews and similarities to other films, are really missing out."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,NightReviews,"Feb 3, 2016",7,"Okay, I know what you all may be thinking, Dirty Grandpa, the newest comedy featuring Robert “Refusing To Take A Pay-Cut” De Niro is just another sad excuse of a comedy featuring a world-class veteran actor whose acting days are numbered and career is slowly fading? Actually, the fact of the matter is, Dirty Grandpa is a very funny, very over-the-top, very rambunctious comedy with nothing but entertainment value, laughs and some good old-fashioned Hollywood fun at the movies, poking redeem fun at itself following the heavy and highly melodramatic Oscar burdened December month.

I can think of so many other disappointing January films that I’ve seen in the past, that quickly make way onto my list of Worst Films of the year. Luckily for **** Kelly (De Niro) and his lawyer loving grandson Jason Kelly (Zac Efron), the two won’t be making their way to that list. Filled with deadpan dirty talk, highly sexualize jokes, crude, rude and obnoxious taboo social references, Dirty Grandpa becomes one wild and dirty-minded fun filled trip to start off 2016.

Not that the film should be a reflection of the film caliber of 2016, but Dirty Grandpa never becomes a film that falls and cannot get back up. Instead, the first comedy of 2016 tells the similar story to Pixar’s Up; but instead of the adorable Carl Fredricksen taking a wild trip on his hot-air balloon, **** Kelly decides that, after a fifteen years abstinence, and with the loving approval of his dying wife, the secret ex-Military man decides to trick his favourite grandson along for a ride to Daytona Beach to find some horny and foul-mouth twenty somethings in a pink Mini Cooper. Kind of the same thing, right?

What begins as a simple guys trip with golfing, dining and some male bonding, quickly turns into a wild weekend looking for answers for both men; sensory for ****, and emotionally for Jason, who is unsure about his marriage to the all too perfect and tremendously overbearing Meredith Goldstein (Julianne Hough), who ultimately becomes the sexiest Bridezilla we have seen on film in a while.

Luckily for our unlikely duo, answers quickly come, in the form of Lenore (Aubrey Plaza); a wild mouth lascivious college girl looking to bone a senior for the sake of completing a life long list of hers; and Shadia (Zoey Deutch), a free-spirited, organic loving, tree-hugging hipster who is the complete opposite of Jason’s Meredith. With the girls off to Daytona Beach, **** begs his grandson Jason to pursue them, knowing that **** is surely going to be able fulfill his dreams of sleeping with a college student. Luckily for the audience, the wildly uncalled for sexual banter between the doe-eyed Plaza and De Niro is what we look forward to the most, making their dialogue the highlight of the film overall. I mean, how funny is it hearing De Niro shout out things like, “Party ’till your pregnant!”, or “I got news for you. That’s the only thing that's going to be pulling out tonight.”(speaking about a pull-out couch).

While the trip to Daytona Beach is anything but smooth, the duo encounter a slew of college obstacles that get in the way of their overall goals of bedding the girls of their dreams; from wild crack smoking Macarena drug-induced trips, to chugging contests, to “Flex-Offs” against dim-witted college jocks Cody and Brah (Jake Picking and Michael Hudson), acting as the duo’s main nemesis throughout the film, Dirty Grandpa is one downright messy, and we love it.

Director Dan Mazer, the man behind writing comedy classic Borat and of course the highly bloated sequel-ish Brüno shortly after, does a decent job of delivering the laughs with a cast that could carry any movie and its comedic material any day of the week. Luckily for Mazer, Dirty Grandpa won’t be a critical hit by any means, but commercially, with a mere $11.5 million dollar budget, the film will likely make a decent marginal profit for the director.

Its rude, its offensive and most of all, the social satire here is totally tasteless, although it is really funny seeing an elderly De Niro asking a group of black street thugs permission of using the derogatory ‘N’ word while singing Ice Cube’s “It Was A Good Day” in a Karaoke bar with his newly made ‘homies’.  Plus, when is a raunchy comedy not offensive? Obviously, if the film and its main **** disturbing protagonist isn’t raising a few eyebrows, something is wrong.

De Niro is Hollywood royalty and can basically do whatever he wants with little to almost no repercussions at this point in his career. So if Robert De Niro, a man who notorious for his contributions to film, The Tribeca Film Festival, New York City culture (including trendy NYC restaurants and hot-spots) wants to do a film where he wears and shows off his prosthetic **** on-screen, hey, Mark Wahlberg did it, why not De Niro?"
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,bttrmovies,"Feb 2, 2016",7,"""Right before his wedding, uptight lawyer Jason (Zac Efron) is tricked into driving his grandfather **** (Robert De Niro), a perverted former Army general, to Florida for spring break."" A movie with the title ""Dirty Grandpa"" can only be a certain type of movie, so you need to keep that in mind going into this. That being said, I can confidently say it's probably dirtier and raunchier than you would expect. I watched the red-band trailer before viewing it, and I was still surprised. I'll say right off the bat, I seem to have the unpopular opinion on this movie right now: I actually enjoyed it.

Let me start with what I liked about the film. With maybe one or two exceptions, I thought the acting in this was fairly good. De Niro really embraces the title role, dropping f-bombs at a rate he hasn't reached since his last Scorsese movie. He's also been an actor that has been known to phone it in from time to time in recent years, and Dirty Grandpa seemed to be a project where he seemed to be having fun playing this over-the-top filthy character. Zac Efron essentially plays the straight man to De Niro, and he does it well. There's one scene where he gets to let loose and it's refreshing to see that he hasn't lost his comedic chops since Neighbors (which he was remarkable in and gets to revisit this year in the upcoming sequel). The standouts, however, are two characters played by Jason Mantzoukas (The League) and Adam Pally (Happy Endings), who are two fairly big names in the alternative comedy scene. I happen to be a big fan of both, and it's nice to see them pop up in more movies that the general public sees. Mantzoukas plays Pam, a drug dealer who owns a merch shop on Daytona Beach, and he's basically a less-gross version of Rafi from The League. Pam is in more of the movie than I expected, which would be annoying had I not liked the character so much. Adam Pally plays Nick, Jason's crazy stoner cousin, who steals every scene he's in. The first few big laughs of the movie come from Nick, and unfortunately he doesn't really pop back up until the third act (save for one small scene over Skype midway through). The writing had some laugh-out-loud jokes that hit really well (at one point, Jason is referred to as a ""Mitt Romney Terminator"" based on his actions). I won't give away too many of the jokes, because some of them come out of left field and are funnier when unexpected.

However, the script is also where I start to get into what I didn't like. If you've seen pretty much any romantic comedy ever made, you know the storyline of this movie. As mentioned in the synopsis, Jason is about to get married to a very high-strung woman (played a bit flamboyantly by Julianne Hough). Very early on during their journey, Jason and **** stop at a diner where a group of twentysomethings are sitting nearby. One of the group members is a girl that had a photography class with Jason in high school (you can probably already tell where it'll go from here). And what you think will happen indeed does happen, which is one of the movie's faults: it's very predictable. As soon as I saw the aforementioned diner scene unfold, I knew the roadmap for the rest of the movie. Also worth noting is that while most of the jokes worked for me some fell flat. Very flat. A few even teeter on being pretty offensive. And that's something you need to know going into this: if you are someone who is easily offended, dear god do NOT see this movie. It pulls no punches, and I can't help but feel it might have been better off it did pull a few.

Dirty Grandpa was one of the lowest-brow, hardest-R comedies I've seen in a long time, and you know what? I laughed my ass off. This is a dumb comedy that knows exactly what it is and who its fans are. Now granted, this certainly isn't for everyone, nor is it even close to a perfect movie. However, I ended up having a fun time with this film and ultimately, isn't that the point of a comedy?"

The cast is superb - Rafi from The League is superb, Plaza is over-the-top raunchy in a great way, and even DeNiro does an outstanding job with his part.

Life as the ultimate narrator and all of us as parts of an amazing story that is told through years, generations, through pain and love. First thing I did when I left the theater was to call my mom and tell her how much I love her and how much I appreciate the fact that I have her in my life.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/life-itself-2018/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Trineo99,"Nov 9, 2018",7,"Now the acting in this film was marvelous. Oscar Isaac was the main stand out to me. He could easily switch from a romantic scene to a comedic scene to  finally a depressing scene so well and you really feel for his character. And despite Antonio Banderas’ old age, no offense,  he also did a stellar performance. When I first found out that he was going to be in this film I thought, ‘Oh god no,’ but after  seeing him in the film I now take that back. His character was one that I would love to have as a parent. The final person that I want to give a  shout out to is Olivia Cooke. Her character was one that a lot of teenagers can probably relate to, or at least the ones who  went through  similar/the same experiences/situations like what she did. The humour in this film was definitely directed at  younger people because my friend and I  were laughing a lot when nobody else was, which  can be both a good thing and a bad thing. In addition,  the cinematography was stunning in this film, and each shot had great lighting . The final good thing I want to mention is how well the serious scenes were taken. Some films can’t do serious scenes without making a joke out of it or it being out of place but this film did them so well. This might have come from how the director and writer, Dan Fogelman, also created “This is Us,” so he knows how to do drama. Now for some of the bad things. The pacing in this seemed off, just by a bit. It felt like they would drag on too much of one person's story and then cut it short at some of the others. Now I understand that they probably wanted to keep it short, but maybe a longer movie would have helped it out a bit more. The movie was predictable as well. Sometimes, being predictable is fine but not when you’re trying to make your audience cry. In the end, “Life Itself” really depends on what you look for in a movie. If you like romcoms  then you’ll like this movie, but if you don’t, you’ll probably won’t ."

This story would have been better served by spanning it over several seasons of episodes; there is way way way too much going on.  I'm a staunch sci-fi fan, yet ALL the scifi things just happened/progressed/clicked so quickly; the brilliance of scifi is how people respond and cope and grow (or not) in the face of crisis and change and opportunity and realization.  Because so much was happening and the transitions so blisteringly fast, the human component was likewise skimmed.  I'd watch the same type of film again, though couldn't commend it, and will remain sad that better justice wasn't done to the story, actors, and concepts by giving them a proper format rather than an ultra-abridged movie version."

Colourisation, wardrobe, and background music were all artfully done. Duncan is a great main character and I love that he’s unashamedly morally grey but has depth in his characterisation. I know some people seem to dislike the amount of blood and sex but hey, I think they’re just wimps. The sex? Couldn’t care less for BUT at least it was Mads and seemed to serve the greater purpose of murder! I mean sure Duncan survives way more than he should but so what, it’s an action flick who cares. Only drawback was ultimately the lack of story between Duncan and the girl, they could have explored that more and her backstory wasn’t as well done."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/polar/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Razzz,"Sep 17, 2019",7,"Polar is a fun movie, and it seems to embrace that. I feel the reviewers to the left have never experienced a campy shindig before. Polar follows a style of being campy and fun, for the sake of being campy and fun. This even is used to make a couple of hard-hitting emotional moments in the latter half more impactful. It's fun to watch, even if you have a want for deep themes and artsy moments. It feels semi Noir as we follow Mads Mikkelsen in his quest to try and enjoy retirement but there are people who don't want him to. The sexual scenes really shouldn't put you off unless you're over the age of 60, granted I do agree they were probably didn't need to be there, especially the third one. It makes sense but isnt needed.

But the movie is just fun to watch, it's presented in a very self-aware style, it acknowledges the craziness of its characters and doesn't even try to justify that, it just goes with it. As the film lets you have fun with over the top action sequences, fun and relatable personalities. Great locations and set pieces, great visual effects and editing. The film is bloody and it isn't shy about showing that. Our hero Duncan is a 50-year old hitman, the best of the best and to prove that he has to kill a lot of people but it stays fresh with those fun action sequences. With those comedic moments, with that fun style of writing, not deep edgy lines about how hurt and tragic Duncan is, but rather having Duncan being an unwilling badass for the first part of the movie, but then he's forced to defend his life and the life of others and that's when you really start to connect with Duncan, he was cool and fun to watch at first then he became badass, emotional and relatable. It takes the Logan route (Great Film btw) **** old veteran trying to escape his old life but Polar is fun, exciting and hard-hitting towards the end while Logan is heartwrenching and an amazing story to watch.

Polar won't win awards for it's deep themes or characters with tons of depth, but if you're looking for a fun action film? A film that can laugh with you. A film that will impress you in every way possible? Polar is a great choice, it's nothing to rave over, no reason to rave down to the film store and spend 10$ on but if you're on Netflix definitely atleast try this film. It's 20x better than what it seems, it isn't the pure edgy thriller that it seems. It's fun and makes you emotional towards the end. Even if it's held back slightly by a predictable plot and character moments, it's mindless fun and is at least worth a glance"

If you want to desensitize your kid or a friend to human violence, then this ranks in the top 3. The plot is unremarkable, you've seen it dozens of times before, but the violent antics of Duncan (Mads M) and the Suicide Squad-like kill team are just shocking. Vanessa Hudgens attempts to ditch her cute-ness with a gritty drama role but it works about as well as dressing a kitten in a cowboy hat, still cute, sorry, so that's a casting miss and if you dwell on it too much can ruin the otherwise dark, violent vibe throughout. Kadee Strickland or Dawn Olivieri would've been a FAR better choice. Camille (Vanessa) doesn't have the commitment in the end to do what should be done, so we have the germ of the sequel which would include even more of Vanessa, so no thanks."

I watched a lot of movies in my life but I never watched one as great as this one and it makes me so sad that the critics did not get it, because it is truly well made. The world needs to see this and the movie needs to reach a much greater audience. I just happened to see the trailer on Youtube and I am so glad that I did. Those that didn't like it I believe were either shocked and negatively affected by the story and reacted negatively because of it or just didn't pay attention to the story.

Because some times you have to do that. And discover that a ""horrible"" movie is not so terrible after all. Sandler bent over backward to create this rather off-the-wall comedy piece, he knew would probably receive slapback. Obviously many critic haters forgot how to laugh. This movie is hysterical, particularly because Sandler cast the right actors in the right roles again, and the script was great. The man still has it, at his age, and he delivered. And I was never much a fan of David Spade, Rob Schneider, or Steve Zahn, but they are awesome players here. As for the ""stereotyping"", are people truly kidding? Look at all the classic Eastwood westerns and some of the Mel Brooks classics like Blazing Saddles, that rocked box offices in the day. Some of them were considered somewhat racial, ethic, or gender stereotype controversial, in spite being popular films. Particularly Brooks with Blazing Saddles, though the movie was a comedy, but quite hilarious.

I laughed on more than a few occasions (the baseball scene and the bank-robbing montage in particular) and I really don't see why everybody thinks it's so racist. Sure, there were a few scenes that might seem kind of offensive, but overall, there wasn't anything as racist as Rob Schneider pretending to be a Native American in ""Bedtime Stories"".

Sure the jokes are lowbrow and crude, but the point is what else is doing this type of humor now? Sometimes you just want to chuckle along with the good natured idiots in the film and go along for the ride. By the end you realize that the writing is not half bad and the plot ties itself up nice and tidy. That's more than can be said for some major blockbuster films out there!

Good job Sandler and crew for pulling off what I predict will be a cult classic in several years. It's good to see some of the old faces. Plus there's surprise cameos. Vanilla Ice is actually pretty funny. Just grab a beer, fire up a joint, put grin on your face, expect crude jokes and have fun!

I've seen a few reviews about it being a movie  revolving around 6 half brothers, and some WTF moments, and the reviews are not positive. There is little suspense, a shallow plot line and some very questionable acting in places. This is most certainly not Nolan's Dark Knight, nor is it Inception, or Shutter Island.

I am not a fan of Twlight, and to see ""Jacob"" on the screen was not something I looked forward to. In actual fact, I should not have judged so quickly! The Ridiculous 6 played their individual roles well, fulfilling every comedy stereotype to facilitate my roaring laughter!

This, in true Happy Madison this is a feature length film of satire, humor and the story of 6 main characters in a ridiculous situation. We thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and would happily watch it again! Well played Netflix, well played Sandler.

For those who disapprove of the plotline following a group of 6 people in a ridiculous situation, perhaps next time Happy Madison and Netflix could warn you, by titling the movie appropriately. Like calling it the Extraordinary Half Dozen, or the Outrageous Sextuplets, or perhaps the Ridiculous 6?

As one might expect from a Happy Madison production, not all of the jokes hit their targets, but that doesn't mean there aren't some memorable sequences. It was great seeing Harvey Keitel onscreen again. Terry Crews pulls off every reaction shot perfectly, proving his comedy chops, and Taylor Lautner goes all out in portraying the dumb brother with a heart of gold. Rob Schneider has some fun moments, too, though Luke Wilson and Jorge Garcia are somewhat under-utilized. John Turturro's sequence as Abner Doubleday is a standout that points out how the rules of baseball seem totally arbitrary. But it's Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain that steals the show IMO. I would normally give this film a 7 but I'm giving it an 8 to counter-balance all the negative reviews. Seriously, did the people who hated this really find nothing enjoyable at all? The gorgeous cinematography and decent soundtrack? The respectful treatment of the Apache? I'm not a fan of most of Sandler's filmography, but this was not a bad or unwatchable movie by any metrics. In fact I'd say it's something of a return to form for him."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-ridiculous-6/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,justplainlucas,"Dec 12, 2015",7,"I feel compelled to write a review about Ridiculous 6 just to counter all the negative ones that people are writing lately.  Adam Sandler has been getting routinely lambasted by people who just don't seem to understand that he's not going to change. His form of comedy is still aligned to his fans.  In short, Adam Sandler will be Adam Sandler.

In a social climate where writers are too cautioned to tell any kind of stereotypical joke, Sandler comes in swinging with South Park tenacity.  He may not be as witty as the Stone and Parker combination, but it hardly comes across as racist.  It's too easy to call things racist today, and that word is being flung around too much lately that it's lost all meaning.  The characters are diverse, and everyone gets it, including white people. You won't find many critics ever bringing that part up, either.  The narrative is that this movie is ""racist"" towards Native Americans.

Now, this is far from the best Adam Sandler movie he's made, but it's also far, far from the worst he or his studio has made (Strange Wilderness receives that accolade from me).  It's framed as a Western parody, but it flows like your average Sandler film. A huge cast peppered with Sandler regulars such as David Spade and Rob Schneider deliver silly jokes and slapstick bits. The humor tends to go a little past my threshold for crude humor at times (a donkey with explosive diarrhea for example) but also has some outrageously hilarious moments like a botched hanging of Taylor Lautner.

Speaking of Lautner, he honestly has stolen the spotlight of this film.  He plays a slow-minded but innocent-spirited half brother (of which all six of the Ridiculous 6 are of relation) to Sandler and this is just a career defining moment for him. It's a goofball role that ranks right up there with other actors who've cut loose like Duane Johnson, Justin Timberlake and Brad Pitt.  Honestly, the aforementioned botched hanging was one of the funniest scenes for me.

To be honest, though, there are two points constantly brought up in the negative reviews that I agree with. First point is that Sandler's acting is simply limp.  The character he is trying to for perform just isn't very enthusiastic,  It's not that it's designed to be that way; you can just tell he isn't putting any energy into it.  It's not that bothersome to me, though, because the movie is put on the shoulders of its supporting cast., which again, is quite large.  The second point is that it's about 30 minutes too long.  There are many skits, including a scene with John Turturro and the origin of baseball, that don't really serve the story's progression.  As a result, some scenes lose a bit of comedic impact because they feel like filler.

If you don't like Adam Sandler, you're obviously not going to enjoy this movie.  Good, because it's not made for you.  Instead, this is a pure Sandler film through and through and if you've been a long time Sandler fan, there's little chance you're going to be disappointed by it.  If you're one of those Sandler fans that loved his older work and wished he could return to that era, your only option is to give it a try.  Good news if you're already a Netflix subscriber: it won't cost you a cent more to watch it.  Give it a shot."

This was mostly due to the sparse dialog, lack of drama, and poor character development outside of the character's sexuality (I mean it's great he was gay, but who IS he as a person).There were many distractions (cinematography and plot jumps/ holes) and unneeded tensions that I felt detracted from the movie.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/moonlight-2016/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Screamager,"Feb 13, 2018",6,"I wanted to like Moonlight. Really, I did. But I can't. I don't know what it is about the film but it just frustrates me.

I screened this film as part of my research into the representation of sexuality and gender in film, believing that this was a significant work. And it is: the Academy Award for Best Picture winner and one of the most highly rated films on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. Naturally, with all the praise the film was lavished with, I was excited.

When the movie ended I was in a state of confusion. Confusion because when the credits started rolling my first thought was ""Is that it?"". I often like films that are subtle in the way they work and Moonlight is an extremely subtle movie yet at the same time it bears the subtlety of a brick to the face; Moonlight is the equivalent of someone tapping you on the shoulder, punching you and then running away before you have a chance to realise what's happening. The film is too conventional and tries too hard to be experimental with it's simplicity: our protagonist Chiron is met with a number of issues throughout his life which are generic, cliched and frankly uninteresting - people claim that this movie is ""all too real"" but for me it seemed like a shopping list of typical film issues that had all been neatly shoehorned to create the perfect tragic character. The problem I have with this is that a lot of the issues are unresolved by the time the film ends, but perhaps that was the entire point, but then again I stopped caring in the last 10 minutes. You see if you're going to go for a film with deep meaning you have to make one that's actively engaging. (Not that I would consider the film deep, it's more a shallow grave of ideas.)

What bothers me most about the film isn't even regarding the film itself but the reviews. It honestly feels as though this film has been lauded by the masses out of fear that to hold a contrarian view would mark you as either a racist or homophobic. You might read this and think I sound ridiculous but there are existing reviews that criticise this film based purely on its artistic merits, and the people writing those have been attacked for those exact reasons. Heck, I read an article suggesting that Moonlight itself is racist and I'll admit that they brought up some valid arguments.

I've glossed over much of the other elements that went into the making of this film and although you may think I'll criticise them, because I do not like the film, you are wrong. The performances are for the most part fantastic, Mahershala Ali in particular was deserving of his Oscar, the film is well-directed and has some great cinematography, the only problem I have is the screenplay and how forced some of the dialogue is.

So Moonlight was a great disappointment for me. A film I was excited for but one which ultimately failed to meet my expectations. While there are many brilliant things about this film there is simply one thing that is too significant to prevent the film from being anywhere near a masterpiece.

Honestly? They should have let La La Land keep the award."

The film itself had some big flaws, at least for my taste. The 1st & 2nd acts felt so organic, it presents situations that people may feel related to, because it was very well made and close to real life situations. Once the 3rd act starts, there is a little ""situation"" involving the encounter of two characters. That ""situation"" felt too unreal, & cheap. It's something that just doesn't happen in real life, and felt forced so that these two characters meet each other. That organic feeling from the first two acts just felt destroyed by that 3rd act and made me feel disconnected & angry by a long time. Therefore, I just felt very underwhelmed by that and it destroyed my experience watching the film. Honestly not worthy of the Oscars best film, but still worth to watch & judge by yourself."

It tells the story of two families whose fates and directions intersect and become interwined in a series of plot twists and turns that sometimes boggle the ability of the viewer to enjoy the film.

Also confusing and somewhat annoying are the English titles that seem to clash against and appear inconsistent with the words being spoken by the actors. At a minimum this recurring inconsistency between the titles and the spoken words became for this writer, at least,  a major distraction.

Rarely have I seen a film receive such unwarranted and undeserving praise and accolade by the critics who I can’t believe saw the same movie I did.

Fuera de eso, la base del film es una historia más de criadas como hemos visto miles en todos los países de Latinoamérica. Con una materia prima tan gastada cuesta hacer algo mejor, aunque esto es una película muy íntima de Cuarón y a esa realidad que vimos era a lo que él aspiraba llegar con Roma."

Critics love it because it doesn’t go for the happy ending.  Casey Affleck will likely win an Oscar for Best Actor.   Affleck plays an average lower-middle working-class guy living in a small coastal fishing town.  Michelle Williams (who is probably too pretty to be believable for the part) plays his wife, and they have three young kids.  Affleck is a happy guy with zero aspirations in life and spends his free time boating, drinking with his buddies and dabbling in recreational drugs.  The movie would have you believe that many people live this kind of life, and that most can get away with living a sloppy and ambitionless life without consequences but, in the dice game of life, Affleck takes a stupid gamble and rolls snake eyes.  He becomes a haunted and angry individual who moves to Boston and ekes out a living as a janitor.  Several years later, his older brother dies and names Affleck the guardian of his high-school age son.  This could have been a movie about redemption.  (It’s the obvious ending choice, and you will find yourself hoping for it, rooting for it.)  Instead, you get a cautionary tale about broken people. Those who like this movie use a lot of adjectives to describe it like: ""heartbreaking, genuine and powerful.""  It is all those things but, it’s also a movie without hope. The ending is sudden and abrupt like a cold slap in the face, a lump of coal in your Christmas stocking, or discovering the Grinch in your living room instead of Santa Claus. If you're looking for holiday cheer, you might want to go see something else."

Michelle Williams sticks out as the real star although Casey Affleck seems to be getting all the hype. Affleck is a great fit for the role. However, he plays the exact same role he plays in all of his movies which makes me wonder about his actual acting capabilities. It's perfect for this movie though. I am concerned that Casey Affleck is like Klaus Kinski or Woody Allen who only can play themselves.
The movie is well shot and has a profound story that's well written. The movie would have been better if it had taken itself a little bit less serious and been sped up a little bit at times, especially in the first half."

I loved the cinematography - the acting was extraordinary but I found the storyline over the top and kind of overblown melodrama. what brought him to get so drunk? how did he survive the unsurvivable? I felt like they just kept adding reasons to not like Lee (Casey Affleck) while feeling sympathetic to the two ex-wives. I feel like they just wanted to create a Job-like character when in fact he is more of a self-destructive character. What brought him to drink and do drugs? Also - although I love the music overall - the placement of the sound on one speaker over whelmed the dialog and the emotions of the scenes. Anyway - great job by the actors - not so thrilled with the director or the writer's job. Sorry - I left the theater feeling as if I was taken advantaged of.

Since the main character and the teenaged nephew who has the main secondary role are not immediately sympathetic characters, the film needs to keep the filmgoers interested with the plot and the personal growth of the characters.  Unfortunately, Casey Affleck never really experiences any personal growth, and ends the film the same as he started.  Matthew Broderick is totally wasted in a cameo role.  The scenery is beautiful, but the film is way too slow moving."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/manchester-by-the-sea/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Dec 2, 2016",4,"""Manchester by the Sea"" asks how do you survive an unimaginable tragedy?? People handle it in different ways and Lee (Casey Affleck) becomes a totally cold, uncaring person who cuts himself off from all those he loves, leaves his hometown, gets a job as a janitor in Boston, drinks a lot of beer and has fights in bars.

The first hour of the film deals with Lee before and after the tragedy, how he was a happy man, father, husband, brother and friend before he became the loner he is now. After his brother, Joe, (Kyle Chandler) dies, he comes home to find out that Joe has appointed Lee the guardian of his 16 year old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges) who in many ways is a typical teenager but is acting out upon the death of his father. At this point the director/screenwriter, Kenneth Lonergan, tells us what the tragedy was and it is almost to painful for the audience to hear and watch. For the next hour and 17 minutes we see how uncle and nephew interact and deal with life, Patrick with humor and sarcasm, Lee without emotions and staying as uninvolved as he can stay. We meet Patrick's mother Elise (Gretchen Mol) who has been out of his life for years, her new husband Jefferey (Matthew Broderick) Lee's ex-business partner and friend George (C. J. Wilson) but most important of all Lee's ex-wife, Randi (Michelle Williams).

While Affleck is getting all the attention in the reviews I was more impressed with 20 year old Lucas Hedges as the 16 year old who can break your heart and a second later having you laugh. Affleck does a strong job especially since most of his scenes have to be done in a monotone, showing no emotion and fighting the pull his nephew on has him as a human being.

Michelle Williams has a very emotional scene, lasting about 5 minutes, with Casey Affleck but as easily as I am moved in a movie's emotionally scenes, this didn't move me.

Gretchen Mol is wasted and Matthew Broderick has a very thankless part. The rest of the supporting players including  Patrick's main girlfriend played by Anna Baryshnikov are all above par.

I love heavy, family, movie dramas but the bottom line is that ""Manchester by the Sea"" is way too long by 15-20 minutes which doesn't make for very much tension and though the scenery of Manchester by the Sea is excellent in all the seasons and there is no fault with the acting I don't recommend it.

Oh, yes, a very distracting soundtrack that more than once takes you out of the story."

Some very beautiful shots & imagery in this movie. I loved the opening on the boat, gave a sense of raw realism. There were some moments I enjoyed for sure... but they were too far and few between.

This revelation, which was brought to light by a team of reporters from a daily sports journal of all things, led to the dissolution of the government and a probing look into the nation's hospital network, exposing system-wide corruption that had been in place long before the catalytic event that spurred this inquiry. ""Collective"" relates the unfolding of these events through unprecedented access to the journalists and reformers who sought to expose a system where patient care was secondary to the self-serving interests of politically connected administrators and their crooked affiliates. However, while director Alexander Nanau's impressive and authentic documentary is indeed a remarkable piece of investigative journalism, its raw footage approach to the presentation of its material is often dry and talky, failing to stoke the kind of outraged emotional response that a work like this should handily accomplish. It thus plays more like a radio report on film than an engaging cinematic presentation, diluting much of the impact that its findings should generate. Sadly, the victims of this tragedy truly deserve more, not only from the government that let them down, but also from the vehicle through which their story was told."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/carol/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,rmurray847,"Aug 10, 2023",5,"I'm a big fan of Cate Blanchett, and have loved her in almost everything she does. Her ability to make a low-key character as credible as a high-energy character. Or to make a working class woman as believable as a wealthy and powerful women. She's great in pretty much anything, and I've bought movies knowing nothing about them except that they starred Cate Blanchett.

I don't care for her too much in CAROL, and in fact, I don't care much for the film. I can accept a film that is quiet, where passions are banked and never allowed to burst into full flame (or at least, not often). But I don't actually want to be lulled to sleep by the film. But there are long stretches that are infuriating because they are a) slow paced & b) there doesn't really seem to be anything happening in the inner-lives of the characters either. CAROL takes the concept of meaningful glances or the exchange of smoldering looks to a degree where sometimes it feels that this is all the film is really about.

Blanchett plays a bored wife (Carol) of a well-to-do man (Kyle Chandler) who is under something resembling occasional house-arrest for a ""romance"" she had with an old female friend (Sarah Paulsen). Essentially, she had an affair, one exacerbated by the fact that it took place with a woman (oh, did I mention, this is the early '50s). On one of her rare trips ""into the city"", Carol shops in the toy department of a big department store, and exchanges glances with the shopgirl (Rooney Mara) who helps her decide on a gift for her daughter. The scene clearly must mean something, because it goes on for a long time. Yet I never felt any passion stirring or smoldering or any HEAT. But Mara is clearly stricken by Blanchett, and when she realizes the lady has left a personal item behind on accident, she sends it back to Carol, and this small kindness leads to Mara spending more and more time with Carol. Apparently, they have the hots for each other, but we sure don't see it for the LOOONGEST time!

I get **** the '50s, feelings of desire for the same-sex were, shall we say, frowned upon and needed to be kept carefully hidden. But CAROL fumbles because it takes so much time avoiding anything coming to the surface even when the two women are alone together. Mara's character is conceived as a bit of a simpleton (in my mind). I suppose she's supposed to be naive and that these feelings are new to her (except they aren't, as we find out in scenes with her friendly but oblivious boyfriend). She seems somewhat out of touch with her own feelings. And occasionally she sounds like she's **** speech slurs and her articulated thoughts meander.

But Blanchett is the biggest miss here. I would have expected those relentlessly silent scenes, or the ones where characters talk about one thing when clearly they're thinking of something else, to have had more impact thanks to her ability to convey her inner life so well. She's done it before (NOTES ON A SCANDAL jumps to mind). But here she seems nearly vacuous. She seems to be striving towards a sensuousness that she's having to keep **** she certainly keeps it hidden (I feel bad bashing her so much, but in my opinion, she is just simply not that good here.)

The movie essentially follows the development of their relationship and also shows its impact on the lives of the men who love them. The ending is actually interesting and in some ways a bit surprising and unexpected. It might even have been stirring if only we cared one bit about these two characters.

So why do I even give the film as many as 3 stars. Well, first of all, the production & costume design is impeccable. The toy department in which Mara works is a nostalgic delight (I wasn't alive then, but it just felt so completely RIGHT). Mara, despite my overall dislike of her character, has moments that are quite nice. The final 20 minutes or so of the film finally kick into a bit of a higher gear (thank goodness) and rescue it from complete forgetability.

I know that this film just racked up some Oscar nominations, including for Blanchett. So clearly I am not in the majority regarding this film. But when a film is about PASSION, whether on open display or carefully hidden, I still need to feel that passion, either because it's openly represented, or clearly building beneath the surface. Instead, I'm left to infer what these characters are feeling, and if I don't care about them much, I'm not willing to make that kind of effort or investment. When the film was over, my wife and I discussed the film for **** were both in agreement that it was not great, and so our discussion was about why the film was held in such high acclaim. We never settled on a definitive answer, because this is so subjective to start with. But in the end, I have to stick with my gut feelings...CAROL just doesn't work."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/carol/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,kino_avantgarde,"Dec 8, 2022",5,"It is a film that is neither deep enough to be praised nor shallow enough to deserve unfair knocking. While the presence of Cate Blanchett adds value to the film, she shows a bit too much in the foreground, which reduces the depth I believe.

It has been stated that smoking is used as an element of nonverbal communication rather than a masculine symbol. Carol smokes when she is self-confident or she wants to impress someone else. Likewise when she is very tense and distressed. Yet not when she is very happy, calm and content; eg in the car, restaurant, motel / hotel. It is observed that she did not smokes for a long time until she had to return home.

Maybe the book is more impressive, so the movie may have fallen short of expectations. However, for a movie that made such a big impact (77 wins & 255 nomination), it could have been so much better in my opinion."

I wish Anthony Minghella or Sydney Pollack were alive to direct this. The movie had very good art direction and little else going for it. There was little to no chemistry between leads. Sarah Paulson and Ellen Page should've been in the leads as they really are lesbian. And like others have said, there was little to know about Rooney's character so how would Carol even love her so immediately, let alone love her over Paulson's more interesting character? The movie was TOO slow. The music was a little too intrusive at times, though mostly beautiful. And the script needed a lot more subtext; especially for that era.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/carol/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Jan 9, 2016",5,"""""Carol"" is an excellent movie with one major negative aspect and two minor quibbles but more about those later. There is no finding fault with the cast as Cate Blanchett a wealthy married woman seeking a divorce from her husband Kyle Chandler. Blanchett  has previously had an affair with Sarah Paulson, a school friend, and is now embarking on an affair with young, not rich, department store clerk, Rooney Mara. The latter is going with a dapper, rich, sort of snobbish boy played by Jake Lacey, though it is Blanchette who buys her the expensive camera she needs to further her pursuit of a career as a photographer. There is also John Magaro a poor, nice guy who works at the New York Times who might be able to help Mara get a job there but he also has feelings for her. Along with the minor figures in ""Carol"" each and every performer gives their best and in the case of Blanchett, Mara and Chandler that is high praise indeed.

The director Todd Haynes, the screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, the perfect production design by Judy Becker, the camera work by Ed Lachman along with the costumes by Sandy Powell and the period music by Carter Burwell bring us a perfect picture of the early 1950s. Not only do we see the right cars like Blanchette's Packard and her full length creamy mink coat but the streets of New York, the Oak Room of the Plaza hotel but even more important the morality of that time regarding homosexuality and the blackmail that can ensue even from people who love you. Though wealth and class levels are brought forward they are done in subtle ways still getting the message across.

There is nothing salacious or predatory about the older woman/younger woman really drifting into an affair with the older woman being who she is and the younger woman finding out who she is. Blanchett and Mara are completely believable in this journey they are taking together.

Now we come to the negative aspect and the quibbles mentioning the latter first. It is very perplexing considering her love for her child that Blanchett would allow her child to be driven by Chandler who is drunk. Another 'driving' incident is that though we know they are wealth there is never any hint, suggestion, showing that they have a chauffeur though we do see the other household staff and yet in another scene we see Chandler stepping into the rear of a car and being driven away. Petty? Quibbling? Possibly but this is part of the negative aspect that found my very disappointing in ""Carol"". I am a **** for a love story, whether it be between opposite or same sex couples, and yet, in spite of their top rate performances, and even their non-threatening sex scene, I felt nothing for this couple. I didn't, couldn't, find myself rooting for them.

It is because of this feeling, this lack of being emotionally involved with what was going on in the film I find myself in a very small minority and would only recommend ""Carol"" if you have a 'thing' for the early 1950s!"

I saw an unequal relationship of convenience; the older woman in transition and looking/susceptible to a diversion and the younger ingenue exploring an expanding world. There was a considerable power imbalance right to the end and I didn't see any blossoming or character growth/development associated with the ""power of love"" in either. I couldn't see a successful future going forward nor a terrible shame if it didn't work out. Actually, I'm assuming that it didn't work out, that each got bored or restricted by the obvious mis-match, turning the story into a pretty pedestrian life event.

Great acting, great filming. Minor characters were merely one-dimensional devices.

Disappointed that it wasn't a bit more socially poignant, as I felt that the societal context was underdone.

I'm guessing that the story is getting more credit than it deserves (for PC reasons) due to it's ""controversial"" subject.

This film is very good creating an atmosphere of New York in the fifties. Great cinematography, excellent sound track. Kate Blanchett is a talented actress.

Blanchett ( a smoldering Rita Hayworth) and Mara (an innocent Audrey Hepburn) enter into a forbidden love that leaves their significant others whirling in an unaccepting world. Yet the lingering pace, the spit focus and a simple narrative kept me interested but never riveted. Good is not great - but gushing critics only help foster the mediocre product we have gotten from Hollywood over the past year. Mr. Haynes - please , sir, I want some more."

It's really beautifully made and on the whole is well performed, but there is a fundamental flaw…there is no chemistry between the two leads. I didn't buy into the relationship at all, it felt unrealistic and the film failed to fully show any real spark of romance.

I applaud the idea to feature a lesbian romantic story and the most interest for me lay in the forbidden nature of that kind of relationship in that period. Its period detail did seem to drip off the screen and it has some really well crafted scenes, I especially liked the last scene.

But, for me, because the relationship lacked chemistry I found myself left cold, even bored at times hence why I started noticing the period detail rather than being lost in the romantic story. I wasn't the only one to think this, my girlfriend felt the same as did some others who were in the cinema I overheard as we left. I think Rooney Mara wasn't the best cast here and I think if I had to blame anyone I'd blame her, she just failed to sparkle."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dunkirk/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Mahmus,"Sep 25, 2020",6,"In my opinion, one of Christopher Nolan's biggest weakneses has always been his characters.
Dunkirk ""fixes"" this problem by almost completely eliminating the concept of characters, but it does come with big downsides.

On the one hand, it lets Nolan focus on what he's best at: the technicals.

The cinematography is stunning, the editing and direction are pretty good (althought the constantly changing aspect ratio is very distracting).
And the music is, once again, Hans Zimmer pressing his whole arm on the keyboard.

On the other hand, not having any real character makes many scenes feel like they drag for way too long and makes for a very dull experience.

If we knew something about any of these people maybe it would have been different.

Overall, it's not a terrible movie, but a very unmemorable one.
Like most Nolan movies, it's technically impressive.

The lack of characterization makes it more bearable for me than something like Interstellar,
but it does negatively impact what could have been a very compelling drama, instead of just a series of well shot battle sequences."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dunkirk/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,zNeverSleeping,"Sep 17, 2020",6,"Tecnicamente impecável, mas o que é além disso?

Essa obra me causou uma pequena confusão mental. Por um lado, eu estava impressionado. A fotografia do filme é um tão impactante quanto um diamante refletido. A técnica de alternar as proporções funciona muito bem aqui, mesmo que seja mais aparente na Smart TV. A trilha sonora se encontra muito presente, o que pra mim é um ponto positivo. O cenário é absolutamente lindo, seja em alto mar, na terra ou no ar. O elenco tá bem definido, mesmo que o mesmo não tenha um peso muito grande aqui. Enfim, assistir essa obra em 4k HDR é uma experiencia unica.

O roteiro do filme está em outro nível. A compreensão de Nolan quanto a técnica narrativa vai além do esperado, e aqui, mais uma vez, ele prova isso e brinca com a linha do tempo para nos entregar uma experiencia mais impactante. O clímax, onde as três storylines se encontram é muito bem feita e conduzida. Porém, nem tudo são flores.

Apesar da minha agradável concepção aos aspectos técnicos, o filme não parece ter uma alma. Meu envolvimento emocional foi zero. O desenvolvimento dos personagens acontece, mas simplesmente não é o suficiente para criar uma ligação entre os mesmos e o publico. A trilha sonora passa a sensação de que mil e uma coisas estão acontecendo, ou que há algo grandioso para acontecer,  o problema é que essa tensão soa forçada, pois nada a altura da OST acontece, e você fica se perguntando ""porque???""

O cenário, apesar de lindo, não aparenta ser de um filme de guerra. Os soldados não parecem cansados, e toda aquela situação não aprece tão ruim quanto o filme tenta nos enfiar ""goela abaixo"". Para uma total imersão, decidi rever o filme no fone de ouvido, sem legendas e com o áudio original. Porem eu não contava com uma trilha sonora tão alta. Na maioria das vezes, principalmente se tratando de compositores talentosos como Hans Zimmer, isso não me chateia, mas aqui todos os personagens fazem um esforço ENORME pra... sussurrar. Não sou fluente na língua inglesa, porém a dificuldade que tive pra entender as falas foi fora do normal. O filme já conta com poucas linhas de dialogo, e quando há, eu não as entendo.

No final das contas, assisti o filme mais uma vez, priorizando o máximo a imersão e qualidade  do mesmo, mas ainda assim não fui capaz de dizer o que essa historia veio para contar.

Edit: Depois de me esforçar muito, consegui entender o porque muitas pessoas amaram o filme. A atmosfera criada pelo Nolan é, talvez, inovadora. O vazio, a falta proposital de emoção, expressividade ou até personalidade provam o ponto niilista do filme. Eu fiquei um pouco confuso, pois a OST tecla muito no drama, que ao meu ver, não existe sem pre-requisitos. Porém, eu consigo sim compreender o porque esse filme é autentico em alguns aspectos, e isso merece sim seu reconhecimento - mesmo eu não tendo entrado no filme.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dunkirk/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Broyax,"Aug 11, 2018",4,"Le meilleur film de Christopher Nolan, techniquement parlant : il tient bien ses caméras, ne les secoue pas et le montage n'est pas saucissonné ; les plans sont en outre judicieusement choisis... Cerise sur le gâteau, le film n'est pas long comme un jour sans pain -contrairement aux Batmous par exemple- et va droit à l'essentiel : bref, on ne s'ennuie pas !

Le spectacle est là et indéniablement impressionnant, sur terre, sur mer et dans les airs... les images de synthèse sont assez belles mais loin d'être irréprochables, les zingues notamment ont l'air de jouets en plastique. On s'étonne par ailleurs de voir -de façon fugace certes- un front de mer très contemporain... de notre temps : les ordis étaient-ils en panne ?

Le fait de découper le récit sur 3 axes -terre, air, mer- est une bonne idée pour le rythme mais se fait au détriment de l'humain, surtout lorsqu'on a en tête l'excellent Week-end à Zuydcoote d'Henri Verneuil mais bien sûr l'approche n'est pas du tout la même, ni les intentions... On a ici à peine le temps de reconnaître les quelques gugusses, trimbalés comme des fétus de paille qui ne se parlent pas ou si peu. Faut dire qu'on a pas le temps de faire la causette, c'est la déroute... mais tout de même.

Et puis, il y a pas mal de détails qui fâchent et font tache ; le petit con qui se cogne la tête et qui clamse, c'est n'importe quoi ; la RAF qui dégomme la Luftwaffe comme à la foire... en fait, trois **** Spitfire qui font le ménage à eux tout seuls ! dont l'un arrive à voler sans essence pendant 10 minutes... sans compter l'autre qui amerrit tranquillou ! et la marmotte, Môssieur Nolan, elle emballe le chocolat dans le papier alu ?

Et puis, on peut déplorer la musique agitée de Hans Zimmer, pas au mieux de sa forme : les trois quarts du temps discordante, cacophonique puis qui singe Vangelis à la fin. Et un petit côté gloriole pas très marqué mais bien présent comme si Dunkerque n'était pas la pire défaite de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale au cours de laquelle une armée s'est fait massacrer tandis que l'autre se carapatait à toute blinde dans la panique et la confusion.

Donc, Dunkerque -ou plutôt Dunkirk pour messieurs les Anglais- ce n'est pas mauvais pour autant mais ça reste étonnamment médiocre et superficiel. Pour une idée de la débâcle, allez passer un Week-end à Zuydcoote, car malgré tout son argent, ce Triple A fanfaron est à mille lieues de la puissance du film français."

It actually felt a bit strange that she didn't bring it up with her, and the missed opportunity seemed like a case of underwriting.

Also, the choice of a song to open & close the film: Who on earth would choose ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" at their wedding, or anniversary celebration? Do you listen to the lyrics? Again, it was implausible and/or lazy, in my opinion: It fits at the end, but come on!"

It's a very well-acted picture, but with the skillful acting in the service of a slim story premised on the idea that a woman (Charlotte Rampling) could be married to a man (Tom Courtney) for 45 years without ever sensing that he had had a previous love. This seems naive. Furthermore, although the embers are obviously dimmed in old age, you don't get the sense that this relationship was ever so romantic that it would have blinded the woman to the husband's secret for very long. Theirs has been a marriage of companionship and mutual comfort, not passion; without passion, there is no plausibility for her failure of perception. It was only when Rampling surreptitiously viewed some decades-old slides of the young woman taken before her tragic death that I personally felt any sense of dramatic involvement with the movie. The earthy, sensual face that stares out at us in those photographs, Rampling's diametrical opposite in every way, was very well-chosen; and in those moments you do get the sense that she would have been a much better match for Courtney….. But in general I found thin reasons here to justify the near-cosmic rating."

This discovery brings memories of twenty-something passion and optimism into a house imbued with sixty-something acceptance, and the resulting trainwreck grows more interesting and affecting the farther it grinds along the rails.  Takes a while to get there, though, or seems to, despite the film’s 95-minute length.  Rampling is outstanding, and nowhere more than in the film’s masterful last scene. P.S.

The movie is basically about the couple's reaction to this news.  Both Courtenay and Rampling give naturalistic perrmances, but the film is very slow moving.  Charlotte Rampling never really discusses her discoveries or her feelings with her husband, so the audience does get the anticipated payoff.

We watch them mundanely go about their daily interactions with a deliberate pace. Nothing about the film is especially affected or emotional.

DeNiro and Pacino are miscast. Frank Sheehan and Jimmy Hoffa were of Irish heritage. The likes of Liam Neeson would have been more appropriate as Sheehan. The middle section is repetitive and concentrating on Hoffa so much throws the movie off balance. Pacino in a bad hairpiece chewing the scenery doesn’t help.

In fact, it feels nearly as if I'm watching all his films in one. Sadly, the story follows a path that many have seen before. The visuals also contain a lack of ambition, showing a style that has since gone stale. It could be fun for a newbie, but not for a Scorsese fan."

The thing I kept thinking most while watching Scorsese's new 10 lbs slowburner in a 5 lb wet bag, was 'how can the critics be giving this perfect scores. Did someone pay them off?'  We've seen much better in the same style coming from Marty. And as shoulderoforion mentioned, the CGI young faces just aren't working for the film.  Especially with De Niro.  Al Pacino really shines in this.  Giving a performance that I feel the rest of the cast just couldn't muster up. It's disjointed and longwinded and these are not adjectives I'd normally use for a Scorsese picture. This isn't going to be a popular sentence, but I really feel like this was a bit of a cheap shot. You don't really have any reason to care for most of the characters but Pesci & Pacino.  Even Ray Romano gave a more ""there"" performance than Bobby.  I would say watch it, and will even give it a 6 just for the big save by Pacino (but that's only a fraction of the film), and Joe Pesci's about-face to stoic, rather than his usual Goodfellas/Casino loud mouthing lovable weasel.  The Irishman works on an odd recipe that is missing so much proverbial seasoning that you get from Goodfellas, Casino, the Departed and even Mean Streets despite it's coldness and preliminary nature in the grander picture of Marty films.  Watch The Irishman.  Definitely. Contort your, face puzzled at the blatant CGI. Take breaks out of boredom.... it's all worth it to see Pacino bring real sentiment to the table, and sell the role so well. That's the best thing I can say about Irishman. Pacino rocked the role of Hoffa. And the rest is all quite forgettable and at times cringeworthy with the de-aging CGI. 6 out of 10."

My only problem with the movie is that the middle drags on with very little happening apart from creating scene after scene of cliched mob dialogue, someone said something about you, oh did he well you tell him I said blah blah atc, and to be honest if it was split up and you put those scenes into other mob movies they would be great, but it's just a tab monotonous and loses its impact when you get the feeling that the mob is a little bit like mean girls.

My initial viewing impressed me, earning the film four and a half stars out of five. However, this second viewing was a different experience, prompting me to revise my rating downward.

On re-watching, the jeopardy and stakes in the film felt significantly more contrived. The tension and plot twists that initially thoroughly engaged me now seemed forced and predictable. Additionally, the characters, both human and emotional, were much less likeable this time around. Some, like Joy and Sadness, which I once found endearing, came across as annoying.

Overall, while Inside Out remains a beautifully animated film with a creative concept, its charm diminished significantly on a second viewing. My excitement for the sequel is now more tempered, hoping it can recapture the magic that seems to have faded from the original."

""Inside Out"" was decent, but nothing spectacular. It was somewhat overwritten and somewhat over-produced. Plus, it was too talky and a little too sophisticated for young kids. Pixar has had a few nice features. Their animation is outstanding, But for the most part they are a little overrated. Their story lines are just so-so. Brave, Up, Cars, Cars 2, Monsters University, Ratatouille, were all too slow for kids (and for a lot of adults). Heck, to be honest, I've NEVER been blown away by any of Pixar's features. However, their movies are just good enough to make me want to see the next one."

Overall it is a decent movie but incredibly slow paced. Pixar definitely makes better movies then Disney... there is always more meaning and depth. However something was missing.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/inside-out-2015/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Spazzh20,"Aug 11, 2015",5,"Here we go again, another Pixar movie that relies on over the top archetypes instead of characters and has no originality whatsoever. This should be fun.

You know I grew up with Pixar back in the late 1990’s and let me tell you the kid in me wants to like them but the objective critic in me can’t stand them. The last film they made that I thoroughly enjoyed was Up and that came out back in 2009. They’re like Activision and Call of Duty now, it’s the same thing every time.

Also If you check their wikipedia page then You will see that they haven’t got anything new planned for the next 3 years. Finding Dory, Toy Story 4, Cars 3. (Wasn't the second one bad enough.)

Why not give their franchises to another animation studio to make an animated series based on these movies like Buzz lightyear of star command instead of constantly going back to the the things that we’ve all seen before. Don’t get me wrong as long as the movie is good that’s all that matters in the end. Even though Call Of Duty is the same game every year at least it’s fun. (Though Ghosts was a big disappointment)

But it seems like Pixar is trying too hard to attract a crowd of new kids without even thinking about the kids that loved them back in the 90’s. I mean Toy Story 3 was essentially Toy Story 2 again just in a different coat.

Open up the movie with a large scale action sequence that is later revealed to be a figment of someone’s imagination, introduce the idea that toys don’t last forever, There is a misunderstanding in which the toy(s) are mistakenly put in a position where the unwanted toys are supposed to be, The toys get placed in new environments meeting new characters, one of them being a jolly plump toy who wields a cane. this toy is later revealed to be an antagonist fueled by the traumatization of being abandoned by their former owner taking his anger out on others, The seemingly good hearted toy convinces the other toys to stay with promises of being loved for generations, A delusional factory setting Buzz lightyear locks up the Protagonist(s) , the protagonists enter a large scale industrial contraption where the antagonists is disposed of and left in the care of another person. That is the plot for both Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3.

And now as if that wasn’t bad enough since Toy Story is so popular Pixar seems to think that all of their franchises should be like Toy Story. Lets take their new movie Inside Out for example. If I were to tell you that there was a Pixar character who all the other characters only exist to look out for their well being but at the same time they’re not aware of their sentience, the entire plot is affected by them moving to a different city, they also have to deal with growing up and leaving their childhood in the past, who am I talking about? I’m talking about Andy from Toy Story right? I’m also talking about Riley from Inside Out, because when you think about it they’re the exact same person.

Now if it were just the unoriginal characters I could over look this film. Unfortunately there are a lot of other things wrong with this movie. The main human character  Riley doesn’t get anywhere near enough screen time. The whole movie revolves around what a person would be like if they were limited to the amount of emotions they had, but other than not getting along well with her parents we don’t get to see much of her personality. We don’t even get to know much about the people in her environment. There was one point in the film where she starts crying in class and is embarrassed that the cool kids saw her cry. I was thinking that this would make for some great social interaction but we never see them again. The movie isn’t a complete dud though, it shows that even negative emotions have their place and reason for being. It kind of reminded me about a game called Sonic Shuffle. At first everyone is angry at the antagonist Void for making people dream negative thoughts but at the end it is revealed that negative emotions give people strength and that people need to feel all sorts of  emotions in order to truly experience all that life has to offer.

When all's said and done I can recommend this movie as a time waster, something for you to take your kids to. But If you are looking for something deep and meaningful then go watch something else. Overall Score 5/10"

Beautifully shot, evocative of a lazy, lovestruck summer month in the gorgeous Italian countryside, it's a thoughtful, peaceful slice of bittersweet romance if not a terribly active one.

Strangely edited, we'll cut away in the middle of a conversation but linger for long stretches of scenery and minor character actions. That does effectively convey the boy's listlessness, his adolescent ennui within a magnificent family estate, but it also leads to major pacing problems. Though it runs just over two hours, I caught myself glancing at the clock after one. Our two leads, Elio (the boy) and Oliver (the intern), share the flicker of chemistry, but initially flirt with so much nuance and subtext that I thought I'd missed something when it came time for their inevitable heart-to-heart.

The climax is excellent, with a charged, open-hearted monologue from Elio's father and an unforgettable close-up during the credits, but by that point I was more than ready to check out. Long, tedious, occasionally rewarding and very, very art house."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/call-me-by-your-name/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,BluesHawk,"Jan 28, 2018",4,"""Call Me By Your Name"" is an awards-worthy masterpiece directed by Luca Gaudagnino. So beautifully crafted in every way that it survives its near-fatal flaw. When Stanley Kubrick's Nabokov-based ""Lolita"" came out in 1962, it was advertised as the erotic adventure of a ""seductive"" teen who you too (men) would not be able to resist. Now in 2018, just as we're buttressing our  protections for children as well as adults from sexual exploitation, comes this romantic, exquisitely nuanced art, ""Call Me By Your Name"", that happens to repeat the horrible example of ""Lolita"". Seventeen year old Elio and his father's colleague, Oliver, fall in love. When Oliver leaves, both are heart-broken. Nearly every review I've read mentions ""coltish"" Elio's  intellectual maturity and emotional vulnerability. Remarkably, his cosmopolitan parents and social network are a model of insight, empathy, discretion, and support. They will help Elio turn his horrible loss into new strengths. The directing, cinematography, and acting that beautifully bring these nuances together is so effective that many viewers will suspend their boundary on man-boy sex.  In spite of our better judgement, some critics and many viewers become willing to believe a youth can seduce an adult; that the adult is not a culpable perpetrator.

Technicalities of statutory **** aside, it's the developmental difference between a young Central Nervous System and a mature CNS that makes Oliver's relationship with Elio such a high risk for harm. We viewers and reviewers have a responsibility to remind the artists we rightly respect that romanticizing, even brilliantly, man-boy love contributes to sexual exploitation of anyone.  ""Lolita"" at its ending exposes the sexual exploitation of the teen as horrifically destructive. Frances McDormand says to her Priest in ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"", ""...you join the club, Father, you share responsibility"". As art is how the culture talks about itself, I believe she was talking to us about ""Call Me By Your Name"".

Call Me By Your Name

Closing the half-open fridge door after someone left it or snatching water bottle out of someone's hands or a locket are some of the finest detailed props used to convey a message which of course ups the ante of the film within it first few minutes. Call Me By Your Name is soothing, light and hopeful film about a relationship within a brief period of time and it is shot within it stretching it over for more than 2 hours, seems a bit much even from an adopted novel. Timothy is brilliant in it and his breakdowns (surprisingly there are few of them) are amazing and his love track is portrayed with such an innocence that it might remind you of Jake and Heath from the Brokeback Mountain. Call Me By Your Name is a movie that feeds more of the character to the audience and sometimes stretches the sequences leading into exhaustion and if it was edited a bit more; it might have been perfect."

And it goes without saying that this is not a love story, let's be honest what the two characters shared was nothing but passion, especially if you take into consideration the age of Timothée Chalamet's character, who evidently had his hormones at full throttle.

A stilted, trite screenplay full of unconvincing and un-naturalistic dialogue might be compelling if it were the voice of the 17-year-old central character.  But as written by James Ivory, Elio is a passive observer.  The unlikeable, closeted characters exploit the women in their lives.  The abrasive music clashes with the stunning camerawork and handsome locations.  This would be better as a silent film.  Read the novel."

First record: it has more nominations than any other I am aware of.
Second record: I do not recall a movie that I would be so bored watching.

Placed into a beautiful Italian scenery, this film is a love story between  a 17-year-old young man Elio who is still trying to find himself sexually and otherwise and an older young man Oliver who is a graduate student of Elio's father and comes to visit them in Italy.

The end of the movie was powerful but by that time I was waiting for it to end already.

Music sounded intrusive and somehow did not fit with either the mood of a situation or scenery.

Not without great moments, the film is just way too slow and too long. Performance-wise, Timothee' Chalamet who plays Elio did a good job for the most part.

Overall, the movie left me cold, I did not feel any empathy. There are many ""gay love"" movies that I liked much more, so the subject is not an issue for me but it is not an advantage either (like for sooo many critics).

How else can I describe it? Too sweet yet it's not sugar but artificial sweetener."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-la-land/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,kino_avantgarde,"Nov 18, 2022",4,"La La Land is a movie that owes its relative success not to the technical quality of the film; editing, script, director, etc.; but instead people's longing for nostalgia, manipulating the audience emotionally, keeping a 'light of hope' alive until the last minute, and of course the leading actors who are loved by both opposite genders.

The fact that it left tears and smiles on the audience's face at the end explains why he is so identified with the audience.

However, if there is one thing to remember, it is the difference between successful and quality film. In addition, success is subjective, quality (technical) objective data; It would be more rational to compare from this point of view.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-la-land/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,ClariseSamuels,"Sep 18, 2018",6,"Film musicals have a long and venerable history in Hollywood, although we see less of them now in this age of skepticism when viewers are slightly less inclined to be seduced by the magic and the illusion of the big screen. Films based on Marvel Comics, which now rule the industry, have succeeded in resurrecting some of that old wizardry that makes the audience forget themselves as they plunge into a make-believe world. Trying to make a magical musical in the twenty-first century that references the classics of the 40’s and 50’s is a risky business, but La-La Land has succeeded in charming its audiences with its song, dance and simple love story of two young people with a dream. Nevertheless, translating what is basically a stagecraft into a musical film is difficult. The forced artificiality of breaking out into song and dance (the phenomenon known as “I feel a song coming on”) is born of the architecture and design of stage and theatre, which is artificial in and of itself. Suspension of disbelief is required for performances limited by the spatial dimensions of the stage, but with live theatre, we are prepared for this practiced tradition of Western civilization going back to ancient Greece (although props and scenery were not invented until after 1600, and the position of scenic designer did not evolve until the 1920’s).


The risk of too much theatrical artificiality is a lurking threat behind this film, but it is to some extent salvaged by the performances of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Their singing voices are so-so but they dazzle when they dance, and Gosling cuts an eloquent profile at any piano. He is the perfect picture of the artist as a young man—romantic, angry, frustrated, a loner who is misunderstood even by the one woman who loves him. From the moment the characters of Mia and Sebastian meet, setbacks,  misunderstandings and financial concerns delay and frustrate their relationship until finally it fails. At the end of the film, a fantasy sequence replaying their entire romantic history in an idyllic version of how things might have been is a poetic testament to the harsh realities of life and how it interferes with the hopes and dreams of the individual. For the most part, the two lovers both achieve what they wished for, but the personal price was high. The poignant, old-fashioned nostalgia of the film is enhanced by the musical score, most especially the haunting refrains of the song “City of Stars,” sung by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-la-land/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,manusbyrne,"Apr 7, 2018",4,"La La land is a musical that does not have good songs or a good story. The story follows a women who dream to be an actress but just can't get a movie role and a man who want to open a bar that plays jazz music. the story is not creative or interesting it is just so cliched.
the film doesn't know what tone it wants to go for. From the advertising and the trailers, you would think that this was going to be a happy musical but no it's a drama and not a good one. Despite of it being a drama most of the song in the movie is a very happy tone and once the songs are over the movie instantly goes back into a drama. Because of this the songs of the movie feel out of place. Not to say that the song is not good. They are actually very good, City of stars is the best song in the hole film it's well written and it's the only song in the hole film that fits in with the tone of the film.
So what about the drama if that is the main focus of the film. well, it's not only bad but it's stooped. The characters are always going back and forward of happy song and serious drama which just ruins the drama.
This film would just be alright if the ending was not terrible. does not make sense for the characters to do what they did at the end and nothing else makes sense about it.

And frankly, I just don't get what the hype was all about.

The story is a somewhat muddled tale of a struggling actress and a jazz musician who fall in love, though they struggle to keep things together as they chase their dreams. Now, a plain story like this can usually be dressed up in a musical with flashy singing and dancing - neither of which are present here. The songs are repetitive, as it turns out that listening to the exact same chord progression repeated for two hours can become a bit tedious; and Stone and Gosling's ""singing-in-the-shower"" warbles certainly didn't dazzle this viewer. In fact, their restrained musical performances are an embarassment to the resplendant costumes and sets that surround them.

What's worst, however, is that its potential did shine through. There are two or three dramatic scenes between Stone and Gosling that are so well written and brilliantly acted, they genuinely show up the mediocrity of the rest. It's not a bad film, by any standards, just very painfully and shamefully average.

Finally, I watch enough Strictly Come Dancing to be irked by the poor shaping of Emma Stone's hands during her final musical number with Ryan Gosling. But that's being quite picky, isn't it?"

For a film so focused on music and theater, it can't manage to pull together any creative effort that breaks the mold. The great musical films have you walking out of the theater with a song in your head that you just can not get out of your mind: Singin' in the Rain, White Christmas, Moulin Rouge's Come What May. None of the songs in La La Land leave any kind of lasting impression. And though Stone and Gosling have good screen presence, it's hard to imagine that there weren't better dancers/singers on offer in LA's sprawling theater scene. Several of the dance scenes and songs seem limited by their talents, and the movie's core message about ambition and creativity would have been much more powerful if the film featured true no-names rather than a highly successful actor and actress."

After suffering thru the beginning, I was a little enthused by the 'pool party' scene, which was finally light, both visually and in mood. But then, it retreated into its marginally directed dirge-y-ness. The wildly over-worked planetarium romance scene looked hokey in this age of great effects... and we are led to believe that two gorgeous adults living in LA are ruminating about a kiss in a way some grade-schoolers might?

It seems like narcissist--and even more narcissist when all the middle-class white film critic favored this movie. What is that? A tribute to your high school memory? People acclaim this film for being real, but I just did not know how is that real. Only real for a middle-class white girl. Oh she comes from California, she dreams about NYC, she looks pretty, she has the most adorable extracurricular activity, she **** with the most popular boy in her school, so what? All I see is privilege, not universal reality. I highly doubt if any film critic in favor of this has saw A Raisin in the Sun. Beneatha is a self-centered college girl, which is super like Lady Bird. But Beneatha is not the protagonist of A Raisin in the Sun, which reflects the hopeless living condition of African American community in 60s. Moreover, in A Raisin in the Sun, the Youngers have more difficulties, and they can barely find a solution. I think that's what makes a great work of literature--you survive and find faith in a hopeless place. To be honest, what difficulty does Lady Bird have? Has she grown?

I would say that all of the actors and actresses do a really nice job playing the roles they have been given. The hard part is that some of the characters are quite unlikeable. Lady Bird is just all over the place. She is self entitled, selfish, and just straight up weird. Saoirse Ronan is a great actress, but I often was taken out of scenes because she is clearly so much older than the role she is playing. I know 20 year olds routinely play high school kids, but something about her appearance makes her look even older. The movie also doesn't really have a plot. It is a good snapshot of what it is like to be Lady Bird. The movie just doesn't deserve the 9 and 10's critics have been giving it. I chalk that up to a couple factors. One is that Lady Bird is obsessed with New York and moving to where there is more ""culture."" This feeds into the elitist mindset of many critics. The other is that the main character and the director are women. Again, most reviewers have a liberal bias and this will buy the movie a couple extra good will points."

Lady Bird is a well made coming-of-age story, but it doesn't bring much new to the table. Set in 2002, it feels like a nostalgic teenage movie, as though it's 15 years to late for the Gen Xers, and it doesn't adapt the genre to deal with more modern teenage issues. There are no glaring weaknesses, except perhaps the father character who is played completely one-note throughout the film. It was never boring, but I don't expect Lady Bird will stick in my mind like other similar films."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lady-bird/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,JLuis_001,"Dec 28, 2017",6,"One more case in which I must row against the current and discover something that a person who had already seen this movie told me, apparently you cannot give a negative opinion about this film and considering what I have seen now that I have finished it, I will undoubtedly be crucified by many, but being quite honest for everything they mentioned about it and the huge avalanche of positive reviews it received, in my personal opinion, Lady Bird is one of the biggest disappointments of the year and yes, is perhaps the most overrated movie of the year along with Get Out.

Lady Bird tells the story of Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, a young woman who lives in Sacramento in 2002, regardless of certain narrative resources that the movie does not need to use, like social networks and smartphones, the time frame in which the film takes place it couldn't have been more irrelevant.
My biggest problem has to do with the main character and when something like that happens, you know it's serious, personally my adolescence flew away many years ago, but for me now as then it would be quite clear to expose Christine as a spoiled, selfish and narcissist brat that at all times and in all situations, she only thinks about herself. Everyone is wrong except her. She also lives complaining about the life she has while doing nothing to change her environment beyond the fact the she's trying to enter an out of state college just to leave the place where she feels locked up, not caring at all that her parents are facing financial problems and have made it clear that supporting her financially is not an option, but she doesn't care because like in many other coming of age films, the ''teenagers'' believe they are being repressed in their place of origin and so their talents are not properly exploited. Cliché and repetitive.

The true strength of the film and the story in general lies in everything that surrounds her, that's the best reason to see Lady Bird because most of those characters have more serious problems and forge what she does regardless of whether she believes that's not the case, starting with her mother and her father, it's true that her mother presses too much, but come on, you have to be honest, it's not like Lady Bird leaves her with so many options with her childish tantrums.
Her father is unemployed and struggling with depression trying to provide for her family and yet Lady Bird's concerns lie in what she will do, avoiding helping in any way.
Her boyfriend, her best friend, the guy with whom she loses her virginity, her momentary and popular friend, her adopted brother and her girlfriend, all form a protective halo in a narrative mode because it's the conflicts of those characters what sustain this movie, otherwise Lady Bird wouldn't have been more than just a movie of another teenager incapable of deciding what she hopes to do with her life and that situation has is been seen already too many times in both cinema and real life

The film gets recomposed in its final section where the character absorbs a bit of maturity and enters a new stage of her life, the ending makes it clear but until that point we can only infer what will be of her in the future and perhaps she will become a better person and certainly then she could have been a better character, but it wasn't the case and for me that diminished my enjoyment and enthusiasm for the film in a big way.

I admit that Saoirse Ronan does a good job, but on front of such script, unfortunately the character doesn't stop being annoying. She manages to give it a little more strength for being a great actress, otherwise I think that the character would have been lost miserably.

Greta Gerwing delivers a film that looks good, that has an uneven but sustained rhythm. She manages to take her first film to a safe harbor but if she really wants to continue making films as a filmmaker, she needs stronger scripts."

All the good bits are in the trailer. Best thing about this was the brilliant Laurie Metcalf. You've got the usual teenage fare: concerns about college applications, sex, and friends but nothing wholly original. I know I am bucking the trend by saying these things, but I just don't get what all the critics are excited about. I am shocked that Rotten Tomatoes gave it 100%. Did Birdman get 100%? What is up with that? If you really want to see a brilliant movie, go see The Florida Project. That lives up to the hype. This movie was tepid, lackluster and forgettable."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shoplifters/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Broyax,"Apr 27, 2020",5,"Un film très social et un peu dramatique (à moins que ce ne soit l'inverse) et peut-être bien une sorte de ""Misérables"" à la japonaise... je dis ""peut-être bien"", car si on reconnaît ici un agenda de justice sociale assez similaire aux préoccupations de notre Victor Hugo, on reste néanmoins fort loin du chef-d'oeuvre français ici...

Et pourtant, pas mal de choses sonnent juste, comme par exemple cette idée que l'amour filial n'est certainement pas inné et que par ailleurs, des parents totalement irresponsables ont des enfants qu'ils sont incapables d'aimer et d'élever alors que d'autres -qui n'en ont pas-  sont des irresponsables qui savent prodiguer tout l'amour et l'éducation (à leur façon...) dont les mômes peuvent avoir besoin...

Bref, en ce bas monde, tout ne tombe pas à pic comme il faudrait, l'instinct maternel (ou paternel) n'étant pas distribué de façon... idéale ! alors évidemment, le petit bout de chou qui fait ici en quelque sorte la Cosette de service est une gamine touchante et cette ""famille"" de bric et de broc est tout-à-fait attachante ! pendant une bonne heure à peu près...

Mais la légèreté de cette première heure est sans doute précisément... trop légère et superficielle, comme détachée du réel, puis la réalité **** nos irresponsables non pas ""affreux, sales et méchants"" (non, rien à voir ici avec l'ironie viscérale et cruellement drôle du film italien !) mais jolis, propres et gentils !

Ce retour aux contingences du monde réel (et ""normal"" en somme) dans cette seconde partie du film s'avère peu crédible et -lui aussi- déconnecté de la réalité ou alors présenté de telle façon qu'on y croit pas une seule seconde... Finalement, on se demande si on se fout de nous, s'il s'agit d'une simple comédie sociale faite à la va-vite, d'un drame pleurnichard qui ne savait pas où il allait ou le résultat d'une incompétence généralisée...

D'autant que les deux heures sont clairement de trop, alourdissant énormément le propos et le drame familial par sa lenteur abrutissante... Cela étant, j'ignore si c'est volontaire ou non, mais les moments quasi-drolatiques sont assez nombreux, ma foi, notamment grâce aux comédiens très attachants eux aussi..."

Hirokazu could create a better story with same cast than this tricky one. I didn't like the ending, it doesn't make you satisfied, also the secrets that reveal at the end, it doesn't make surprised, it's better to keep the story clear from beginning, I think it will be more sentimental.

El propósito de Shoplifters es importante, complejo y con un valor reflexivo enorme, sin embargo, su valor final está en el dilema moral (que solo propone) y no en la experiencia narrativa y cultural que trata de integrar a ese dilema.
Esta es una familia que puede ayudar y adoptar a una niña con quien solo ganan dilemas morales y económicos.
Con 2 horas de duración, Shoplifters le dedica 3/4 del tiempo a explorar esos dilemas y exponer una gran gama de emociones personales. Al principio es fácil dejare llevar por esa observación y admirar los detalles de un espacio oprimido en una cultura específica, pero la falta de tensión y la gran carga de sensibilidad provoca que la #película se vuelva pesada y menos conmovedora, aun cuando visualmente intriga el hecho de que puede agregar textura, temperatura y tamaño a la historia. Es hasta el último tercio cuando se presentan una serie de enigmas que no se introducen previamente de forma adecuada. A partir de ahí, la actuación se eleva minimamente para cooperar con un suspenso con poco sustento, pero que tiene éxito en plantear un dilema moral que, mientras más inocente sea el espectador del propósito, menos atención ganará.

The porpoise of ""Shoplifters"" it's important, complex and with a big reflective value, however, its final value is in its moral dilemma (which only proposes) and not in the narrative and cultural experience that tries to incorporate in that dilemma.
This is a family that can help and adopt a little girl who only brings economic and moral dilemmas.
With 2 hours of duration, Shoplifters dedicates 3/4 of its time to explore those dilemmas and expose a wide range of personal emotions. At the beginning its easy to let go by that observation and admire the details of a repress space in a specific culture, but the lack of tension and the big deal of sensibility provokes that the #movie becomes heavy and each time less moving, even when visually intrigues the fact that it can add texture, temperature, and size to the story. It's until the last third when a series of enigmas are presented without being introduced properly. From there, the acting elevates minimally to cooperate with a suspense with little sustain, but it achieves to stipulate a moral dilemma that, while more innocent the spectator is of the porpoise, less attention it will have."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shoplifters/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,OlivierPiel,"Feb 18, 2019",4,"I like my Japanese films as much as the next Western snob but I really had to give up 25 min in. I read critics comparing this to Ozu, Mike Leigh, the Italian neo-realists or even Bresson. However Ozu and Bresson use a much more focused and minimalist cinematography that convey a far superior poetry and art. Some of the scenes feel as gratuitous and mostly used for shock-value for the Japanese middle-class audience (the introduction to the family home with the granny cutting toenails at the table is so ham-fisted than it becomes too farcical). Other critics say that you have to wait for the second part to see resolution. If that is a case, then the director commits the number crime in art: boredom! As for the other comments on ""humanism"" (heart-wrenching etc...) and ""naturalism"" or ""realism"", these actually confirm the lack of intrinsic artistic value of this film since ""mirroring the reality of those less fortunate"" reeks of the most hypocritical impulse of the middle-class, pity and commiseration."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shoplifters/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,BHBarry,"Dec 6, 2018",6,"""Shoplifters"" is a Japanese language film written and directed by Hirokazu Koreeda. This is a difficult film to watch for a number of reasons, the most prominent being that the script and the story it tells is confusing and almost impossible to follow. The last third of the film tries to explain who the characters really are and the motivations each has in relation to the other but this places too much of a burden on the audience who, for 2/3 of the film had to sit adrift and at sea in trying to find out exactly what is going on. Much like the critics of the artsy Ingmar Bergman movies, so many of the critics who loved this film saw more in it than I believe the writer/director ever intended. The editing room needed someone in it in addition to Mr. Koreeda in order to give objective cuts, segues and scene placement changes so that the story sought to be told would be more easily understood. In its present form, however, and bearing in mind the kindness of the season, I it a 6.0  with the responsibility for this low rating falling squarely on the shoulders (and probably the ego) of Mr. Koreeda."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,TVJerry,"Jan 20, 2022",6,"A German music teacher (Peter Simonischek) has a strained relationship with his adult daughter (Sandra Hüller), so he decides to surprise her at work in Bucharest. Unfortunately, his appearance interferes with her all-consuming job. After being rejected, he creates an alter ego and insinuates himself into her career. His slightly absurd presence seems implausible and her reaction is surprisingly muted, however it's pretty obvious where this is headed. Simonischek's performance is eccentric, while Hüller eventually lets us see the cracks in her resolve. Even though the premise could be considered amusing, the execution was more European in its subdued approach. The historical literary definition of a comedy is a story that ends happily, but the modern audience likes to laugh. I didn't find one funny moment in the whole film and 2:45 is a long time to keep hoping for fun. (In German with subtitles)"
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Spangle,"May 5, 2017",4,"Toni Erdmann is not a funny movie at all. It is cringe comedy for two hours and forty two minutes. This film is a major misfire that really flew right past me and made me wonder if everybody else was watching the same film I was. Immediately, I knew that this was a film that would likely not be my style once the character of Winfried Conradi / Toni Erdmann (Peter Simonischek) was introduced. With childish jokes left and right that are incomprehensible as jokes in the human realm, the film continuously shows his prank-influenced style of jokes in a nearly three hour long compilation of YouTube pranks. Going to Romania to try and make sure his daughter Ines (Sandra Huller) is enjoying life in the country, the film shows him try to get her cheer up and become less serious. While their relationship is nice, the film itself is really anything but for most of the runtime.

The jokes vary from being completely undetectable to being cringe-inducing when he ruins her business dealings in Romania to being just flat-out childish. Examples of each are when he tells the guy there is a bomb in a package, him creating the alter ego of Toni Erdmann who holds various titles and is all an inside joke where he pretends to be somebody else to creep on his daughter, or when he sits on a whoopy cushion. In essence, whoever conceived of the comedy in the film likely just finished watching an Adam Sandler movie and Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot. Considering I did not like the latter and Sandler movies are universally trash, there is no way Toni Erdmann was going to be a film I was going to enjoy with this style of comedy and awkward humor at its core. There was honestly not really a moment where I chuckled or came near smiling, except in sarcasm when I got progressively more-and-more aggravated that I was wasting nearly three hours of my life watching this schlock.

However, fortunately, its drama is very good at times. I still hate the father character who is one-note and has no idea how to relate to his daughter beyond making childish daughters. Meanwhile, his daughter is a serious businesswoman. Sure, I do not understand having that much passion for your career, but she does. Why is she the bad guy who just will not let her grating father into her life? He ****. I would cut him off too. What is worse is when his influence begins to rub off on her with the cringe-inducing naked party to build team chemistry. A last second decision to cover up her own error, the party is a failure and an intensely awkward at that. However, Toni Erdmann really saves itself in the final act with a raw and emotion-filled scene between Winfried and Ines where they discuss happiness and life. The two have finally come together again and no longer have that great distance between them, which is a nice thing to see. I just wish that Winfried was not eye gougingly annoying, which is he is not in his best moments such as at the egg painting party. Raw and open about who he is and how he wishes his daughter could lighten up, the audience can really root for the guy in this moment. Unfortunately, it is immediately followed up with him showing up to the naked party in a huge mascot outfit, which is a major turn off and plays too heavily on absurdist and awkward humor, considering his daughter is naked right in front of him.

However, the strong dramatic leanings of the film are undone with a gratuitous runtime that never really justifies itself. The film floats by for nearly three hours and I could never really figure out why it had done so. This is a film where I wish some American studio got their hands on it and cut it down from 162 minutes to 90 minutes. It never needed to be that long and needed to go under the knife for some serious liposuction. As it stands, it is a tall task to watch with practically no enjoyment in store whatsoever. It is not funny. Its drama borders on annoying until the final act. Its characters are all one-dimensional with Winfried being nothing but a goof ball who loved his dog and daughter, while Ines is just a stuck up **** of a businesswoman (a character trait that is becoming far too common nowadays, as if there is no middle ground between a woman who is passionate about her career and one who is just a callous **** who cuts jobs without blinking). Thus, even its character study inclinations fall flat and really reveal very little about the nature of the characters as individuals, only in the context of how they behave with one another.

Fortunately, it is this father-daughter relationship and both of their attempts to try and mend that broken link. However, the film is so unrelentingly unfunny, crude, and poorly written, its emotional core is nearly entirely blotted out. Had this film been a tight 90 minutes or a little more, it would have been far more enjoyable, as a lot of the fluff and annoying bits would have been cut out. Unfortunately, it is 162 minutes long and never seems likely to end."

Between Two Ferns: The Movie

I don't want to be that guy that thinks that one should stick to what they do. There is nothing wrong with trying something new. Whether it be physically, changing locations or genres or changing formats. On that note, the co-writer and director Scott Aukerman's film is a fresh peak behind the camera of a lovable show. This might be the pitch at the Netflix office. It should be it. What's best and the worst thing about the film, is the admiration they have for the lead character, the interviewer, Zach. They don't take him for granted. They don't want to lose him. And in order to do so, they are returning back to those old sitcom sugar coated schemes that gathered crowd like controversy does to media.

But it doesn't work. Not the fact that the interviewer Zach and the character Zach are completely different personalities. If anything that should have made it more grounding and fun to watch him play. Watch him juggle the on and off screen face twitch beautifully in the middle of this race against time chaos. And instead what has happened is that the crux, the thrill of those interviews have been snatched away from us.

Now, despite the insults are audaciously wrong and cuts deep to sensitive parts of the lives of these celebrities, the intention, the motif paints itself like a commercial strategy. A strategy that Will Ferrell explains and has based his empire on. The click bait theory is glorified by them inadvertently. And something that is actually menacingly taking over the authenticity over the data, the enormous amount of data flooded out in the world. Between Two Ferns: The Movie should have been a good weekend night out, instead we're stuck on Wednesday, a week day, working laboriously to finish what we have started.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/between-two-ferns-the-movie/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,theredsky,"Sep 21, 2019",4,"Between Two Ferns: The Movie is unfortunately, a forgettable comedy film. Here are the positives. The best part about this movie is that most of the celebrity interviews are pretty funny. The segments with Matthew McConaughey, John Legend, Paul Rudd, and Peter Dinklage are pretty funny while the other celebrity interviews are entertaining at best. There are some outtakes during the end credits that are funnier than most of the film. That’s kind of disappointing that your outtakes are funnier than most of your film. I think Zach Galifianakis does a good job with what he is given and helps keep this film afloat. The film has this mockumentary feel for it and the camera work compliments that. It’s shot in a way a mockumentary would be and it’s refreshing. The film can be self aware at some points and doesn’t try to make itself bigger than what it is supposed to be. The film does what it needs to do and then it is over. Here are the negatives. The story is kind of lame. It’s another one of those “redemption stories because a character did something embarrassing” that has been done to death. The film doesn’t do anything to establish itself as something different.  Everything other than the celebrity interviews is incredibly boring and starts to drag heavily. Fortunately, as it starts to drag even heavily, it switches to another celebrity interview. This also leads to a weird structure issue though. It does start to feel out of place when it changes so suddenly but it does lead to better scenes. About 75% of the jokes aren’t that funny which is unfortunate since it is a comedy film. Like I said earlier, I got a bunch of laughs out of the outtakes than I did most of the film. The editing for this film feels very amateurish. It has a bunch of quick cuts that are distracting and obnoxious. This also leads to a pacing issue. It’s weirdly paced due to the quick cuts and awkward structure. It’s these issues that really drag the film down. Overall, Between Two Ferns: The Movie has some funny sequences but is held back by a cookie cutter story, lots of boring moments, and awkward pacing. I give Between Two Ferns: The Movie a 4/10."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-is-true/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,DawdlingPoet,"Nov 27, 2021",6,"I thought this was a reasonably good film - there's a good cast and Judi Dench gives a particularly decent performance but I did find Branagh's prosthetics quite distracting - it didn't quite look right, it was a bit overly embellished or some such. Ian McKellen looked more the part as the earl of Southampton, I thought.
There are definitely some poignant moments but there are relatively dull moments too. Of course the story of Shakespeare's young son dying and him not being there to witness it, is a sad one - its nothing to trivialise at all, certainly. I believe this film was written by Ben Elton and I could see that it perhaps inspired him to go on to write the BBC TV sitcom 'Upstart Crow' - indeed, Shakespeare is called precisely that during the film. There is some nice scenery, so that's a plus as well but I did think the script could perhaps have been improved, as on ocassion it felt a little slow and without a real structure. I reckon it's worth sticking with, as it becomes most poignant right towards the end but if your not keen on period dramas, or interested in Shakespeare, then its not really worth seeing. Also, I should point out that it is a fictionalised account of what happened during the final years of Shakespeare's life, after the famous Globe theatre was burnt to the ground. The irony of the film being called 'All Is True' has not passed me by(!). It does provide food for thought but I wouldn't say its one of my favourite films of this sort (costume/period dramas), no. If your a fan of Judi Dench, however, I would recommend it and if your interested in a pre-Upstart Crow Shakespeare film written by Ben Elton."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-is-true/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Bertaut1,"Feb 21, 2019",6,"A strangely formless and insubstantial love-letter to Shakespeare

Directed, produced by, and starring Kenneth Branagh, All Is True is a pleasant enough film obviously born from great reverence, but is also clumsily episodic in structure, and relatively free of conflict, focusing instead on non-incident. By the very nature of the years during which it takes place (1613-1616), Ben Elton's screenplay is full of interpolations and suppositions, some of which are interesting, but many of which don't work. There's a much better film hidden in the contours of All Is True, a darker story examining Shakespeare's (Branagh) psychology; his inability to process the death of his son Hamnet (Sam Ellis), his guilt over the fact that he put his career ahead of his family, his possible misogyny, his obsession with his legacy. These issues are in the background, but they are not the focus, and whilst All Is True is perfectly fine, it's also perfectly forgettable.

Possibly a palette-cleanser for Branagh, allowing him to return to the familiarity of Shakespeare, after several years working on relatively impersonal projects, and with two blockbusters on the way, All Is True begins on June 29, 1613, as Shakespeare watches the Globe Theatre burn to the ground, after a canon misfired during a performance of All Is True. Devastated, he retires and returns home to Stratford. Coldly received by his wife Anne (Judi Dench) and youngest daughter, Judith (Kathryn Wilder), he gets a slightly better welcome from his eldest, Susanna (Lydia Wilson). Still mourning the death of Judith's twin, his only son, who died from plague aged 11 in 1596, Shakespeare decides to grow a garden to honour his memory. However, he must also try to deal with Judith's hatred for him, stemming from her conviction that he believes the wrong twin died.

Easily the best in the film, involves Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton (Ian McKellen) visiting Stratford. Discussing his identity as the ""fair youth"" to whom Shakespeare addresses the first 126 sonnets, Shakespeare quotes in its entirety Sonnet 29, with Branagh reading it as an agonised ode to an impossible love. Southampton then also recites the poem, with McKellen's intonation changing it into a celebration of the power of art to transcend such foolish distractions as love. It's a beautifully shot, incredibly well acted, and nuanced scene that, if it accomplishes nothing else, serves to remind us just what talented actors can do when reciting the exact same text.

One of the film's main themes is, of course, family, with Elton's script focusing on how resentful Anne and Judith have become of Shakespeare. We don't know a great deal about the real Judith, so much of Elton's characterisation is speculative. The film's Judith is a protofeminist, a brilliant woman railing against the narrow-minded patriarchy her father endorses. The likelihood of this being the case is slim at best, but Wilder is excellent in the part and makes Judith much more believable than the character has any right to be. The film acknowledges that Shakespeare was a neglectful father and husband, and never fully gets behind him as he defends himself by citing the cultivation of his genius. However, by the end, even he doesn't believe this himself, coming to understand the price his family paid for his greatness.

However, there are some considerable problems. First and foremost is the script, which employs an extremely episodic organisational principal, with scene after scene addressing one and only one issue at a time, ensuring each issue is cleared before moving onto the next. Scenes often involve the characters saying only what is necessary to get to the next scene, with little room to breathe, almost as if we're watching a ""previously on"" montage of a TV show.

The casting is also problematic. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Dench and McKellen as much as the next man, but that doesn't change the fact that they are both badly miscast. Both play their characters as elderly, but in 1613-1616, Anne (played by the 84-year-old Dench) was 57-60, and Southampton (played by the 79-year-old McKellen) was only 40-43. Additionally, Anne was six years older than Shakespeare, but Dench is 26 years older than Branagh, and it shows, serving only to distract from the content.

As a Kenneth Branagh fan (and a fan of Ben Elton's Upstart Crow (2016)), I was disappointed with All Is True. The film tries to strike a balance between a laid-back and **** story about a retired writer, and a study of filial grief. Some elements unquestionably work; the Southampton scene, Shakespeare's struggle to reconcile his genius with the personal cost of that genius, Judith's resentment of Hamnet. But a lot doesn't work. It's an inoffensive and perfectly fine film, but given the director and the subject, it could, and should, have been so much better."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/doctor-sleep/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,BryanAndrew,"Apr 9, 2020",6,"'Doctor Sleep' is personally a disappointing sequel to the iconic cult classic 'The Shining', that sways toward being an superhero-eque action thriller rather than a psychological horror, and yet drags on way more than it should have, filled with unfulfilled build-up and directionless dialogue that poorly attempts to convey a deeper meaning. The plot of the film, although comparatively broader than that of 'The Shining', opts for a more shallow and straight-forward storytelling style. The acting was also rather dull and fails to evoke any sense of fear or desperation in the otherwise horrendous situations that the characters find themselves in. The set and costume/makeup design of the film's rendition of the Overlook Hotel and its ghostly residents is certainly nostalgic but fails to bring anything new to the table despite being almost 40 years apart from the original film; the same goes for the movie's run-of-the-mill cinematography and bland sound design. The visual effects of the 'astral projection' scenes toward the early middle of the film were promising and actually entertaining to behold but the film detracts from that later on in the film and we are left with sloppy CGI scenes later on. All-in-all, the film is still an interesting watch for those who enjoy thrillers and those who are fond of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, but don't expect anything that would evoke anywhere close to the same level of disturbance or terror as the classic film did back in 1980. 'Doctor Sleep' scores a 6.25/10."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/doctor-sleep/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,netlord80,"Feb 27, 2020",6,"This is a review of the theatrical release.

This film is a worthy followup to The Shining.  The story is very compelling right from the start.  There were some elements of the film that do tend to take you out of the film though.  These issues were almost unavoidable due to how iconic the performances were in the original film.  I will go into more detail a bit further in, but I would still strongly recommend this film.

The recast characters from the original were pretty mixed in my view.  Alex Essoe and Roger Dale Floyd were absolutely phenomenal playing Wendy and Danny from the 1980's.  Alex Essoe in particular did such a good job that I was stunned by how she was able to perfectly capture the performance of Shelley Duvall.  Halloran and Jack are a different story all together.  Those performances really dragged the film down a bit in my view.  I can't blame the actors or filmmakers for that.  Having originally been played by Scatman Crothers and Jack Nicholson, there simply wasn't much they could do.  Both the actors and the roles were simply too iconic.  The best they could have done were impressions, and that would have been far worse. It took a lot of courage for the actors to take on those roles in the first place, so credit is due in that respect.

A major positive is that the film has you invested from the very beginning.  Kyliegh Curran was outstanding in this film.  There are several scenes that would have been very challenging and she absolutely nailed it.  There is one scene in particular were the subtlety of her performance was simply outstanding. I would rate the bad guys as good, not great.  They simply weren't given much to work with.  Who and what they are is only hinted at, which is a very good thing.  This is based on a Stephen King novel, so that was likely never explained there either.  This is a good thing and I am glad they held true to that aspect of King's writing.  Not everything needs an explanation.  In fact, the more frightening things in horror are always mysterious, the unknown.

All of this being said, the tension in the film feels a bit muted.  I never had a serious feeling of dread at any point in the film.  The power dynamic was set up in a way, that the villains never felt like a serious threat in the film.  There are some tense scenes, but I never felt like the protagonists were at serious risk of losing at any point.

The ending of the film was serviceable, but not really great.  There was one moment that was clear fan service that was really pointless.  Aside from that, it was another good, not great part of the film.  The biggest issue I had with the ending was that I saw it coming a mile away.  Overall it was very predictable, but still enjoyable to watch.

This film is certainly worth a watch, but it does have a number of issues.  If you can look past those, you will have a good time with this film."

Too many movies in one and too inhomogeneous. The part I most appreciated is about the management of the shining, an ambivalent paranormal power that risked being still treated as a metaphor for adolescent issues (Stan Lee, Marvel, cinecomics). Instead, small debutante Kyliegh Curran and Ewan McGregor wander around in adult and less unresolved territories than ""Red Lights"" (Cortés 2012), favored by the stage presence of Cliff Curtis, Bruce Greenwood, Zahn McClarnon (here a native North American Colin Farrell) and above all of an unforgettable Rebecca Ferguson. The part on immortality (the True Knot vampire villains) and afterlife (the Doctor Sleep's dialogues with the dying) is frivolous, and the one on the Overlook Hotel simply bogus. Taking note that no image of Flanagan possesses a single shred of Kubrick's iconicity, I would have chosen to avoid confrontation at any cost."

I found it difficult to watch as the characters nor the world ever appeared organic or mysterious, rather than caricatures of human beings, spilling exposition and making forced decisions. You can tell all the ideas in the movie are genious when flying off the page of Stephen King, but the film language doesnt really do justice to his sense of darkness and evil. The same goes to its relationship with Kubrick's The Shining with which shares the same amount of similarities as fine wine does to kool-aid. Finally, if the movie wasn't insufrible enough, they couldnt let go of the opportunity of trying to establish a franchise with the last scene."

How do you unite both of them? And how do you attract the audiences? Surprisingly, Mike Flanagan succeeded, although relying significantly on Kubrick's film. That's not a bad thing because in one way or another how could you announce it as a sequel to The Shining in the cinema without recognizing Kubrick's film?

The changes themselves are not so annoying, they're understandable and after all as I have said repeatedly, a book and a film are very different narrative media.

The film itself is pretty entertaining although its duration is excessive. Especially considering how scattered and muddled its beginning feels, but it manages to catch pace and although it has its problems, this is due more to the unfortunate need to overexplain what is happening on the screen instead of giving more agility to the narrative.
Ewan McGregor doesn't do a bad job but I didn't feel his work so solid, the truth is that I felt him somewhat disconnected. Rebecca Ferguson on the other hand feels more involved but the story fails to give her a memorable moment, which is a shame.

And even though it can be considered that this film is one of King's best adaptations, it should also be clarified that this is due to its final act because after all and even if it may not seem true to some, the biggest impression the film will leave you comes from the scenes at the Overlook Hotel, but I repeat that's not a bad thing.

Doctor Sleep is not a bad film at all as I said it is one of King's best adaptations and it's known that getting that is very difficult but Mike Flanagan did it.
He continues to consolidate, he did it with Gerald's Game and especially with The Haunting of Hill House and here he offers another good addition to his filmography. I recommend it, with certain reservations but I think it's worth it. It is a worthy sequel. Maybe not from the massive legacy of Kubrick's masterpiece but justifies its existence."

Based around something as universally understood as music, Sing seems to be an appropriate first-time directing effort by the duo Christopher Lourdelet and Garth Jennings (who directed live action before). The result of their hard work brings a passable accomplishment by the studio’s sixth ever full-length feature, even if no studio gamechanger nonetheless.

The feature takes place in an unnamed San Fran-Los Angeles-esque city painted by Miami, home to many anthropomorphic mammals, reptiles, birds, primates, household pets, cephalopods, arachnids, and whales. We focus on six mammals: one a producer, five the lucky choices for his theater-saving singing competition. Plenty celebrity voices deliver occasionally terrific singing, although the minor roles’ unfitting voices draw back the overall quality. Surprisingly however, the anthropomorphic individuals’ subplots are all masterfully balanced in their yearnings on the road to fame and fortune:

Buster Moon the koala (Matthew McConaughey) wants to keep the theater financially stable after his father passed down the torch. Despite being the lead, he is the least interesting cast member, more existing to vocalize the cliché morals. Though he still plays great off the more colorful characters, including his dimwitted senior secretary, Miss Crawly the iguana.

Rosita the pig (Reese Witherspoon) wants to follow her passion away from her uncaring husband and twenty-five children. She soon meets unexpected challenges when the competition pairs her with an overly optimistic pig named Gunter. This widely marketed chunk of ham shockingly gets little stage time; and I should also mention how he flaunts an indistinguishable European accent exaggerated to the point of annoyance. The immature will worship him like Moccus, leaving adults to gag a bit while watching an overweight swine in a unitard stereotyping western culture.

Johnny the gorilla (Taron Egerton) wants to escape his father’s criminal lifestyle, and follow his heart for the microphone. Boys across all ages will relate to this highly soulful musician, despite a phoned in resolution to his subplot.

Ash the porcupine (Scarlett Johansson) seeks public appreciation alongside her boyfriend/musical partner. While her story feels relatively unengaging compared to the others, she still brings a nice voice, especially when her guitar strums electrify her quills to the point of showering out.

Mike the mouse (Seth MacFarlane) needs the prize money to pay back a bear gang who see him as a tasty meal. His ratty account maybe could have benefited from higher stakes against the law; but it does not matter anyway, for this crude comedian providing the voice amazingly makes a tiny crooner so ruggedly lovable with some spice thrown in.

Meena the elephant (Tori Kelly) cannot pursue her love for singing, as her glossophobia gets in the way, with no thanks to her arrogant grandfather. She has the most poorly balanced yet easily relatable experience for all the boys and girls facing a similar fear.

Together, doubt gets conquered in a unified walk to fame and fortune. So who ends up winning the competition?

It doesn’t matter! They are all too introspective to notice one another, as these well-rounded individual stories have zero interweaving amongst one another. In the end, Sing cares less about teamwork, and more about getting children to worship the most popular hits by Lady GaGa, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Carly Rae Jepsen, and everyone else out there (just stay through the credits, the list of songs used lasts over a minute). It doesn’t matter if the human artist singles are sung by cute little animals; accompanied by predictable fart jokes, evidence proves why this movie aims squarely toward kids with an affinity of music over rules, offering the parents nothing more than a few scattered chuckles to at least manage without booing the artist offstage."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sing/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,LeopoldTheBrave,"Apr 2, 2017",6,"I like this movie A LOT for some reason. I know it's only mediocre at best. But there's something that keeps making me come back to it. There's LOTS of positives, but a negative for each one.

For example, all the characters are very likable, but because there are so many, we barely get to spend a lot of time with them.

The movie is paced very well at the start, letting us get to know all the characters we'll be seeing throughout the movie. But it falls a bit at the end when it focuses a bit too much on Meena, the most generic of the lovable cast as she just plays the role of ""The shy girl.""

The animation is fantastic. There's a wide variety in character design, and the environment looks great. You can really see yourself in the city or town where the movie takes place. But that's also a problem. While it's pretty, it has no creativity. You could replace all the animals with humans, and they could live in this world perfectly fine. While I do prefer this movie over Zootopia's overly forced message, predictability, and mediocre characters, they at least got the creativity in the animation correct.

Overall, I find Sing to be a very enjoyable movie, but I am aware of its flaws. I'd definitely recommend it over Secret Life of Pets, Zootopia, or any other talking animal movie that came out in 2016. (Except Kung fu Panda 3. Nothing beats that. Ever.) Without borrowing the plot of Toy Story like Secret Life of Pets, or a forced message that reminds you how **** the world is for 100 minutes and makes you feel all melancholy like Zootopia, Sing is able to pull you into its happy world and distract you for a good bit. Not the kind of distraction that you'd sit your kids in front of to quiet them down for a while, but a good distraction that you'd enjoy watching with your kids to pass some time on a rainy day."

The story is simple, but not altogether predictable.  Not sure what the moral of the movie is, but I guess it would be to follow your dream no matter what.  If you're going to have a really simple story, then you should make the movie as funny as possible.  That's where the film fails for me.  I didn't laugh all that much.  It tries hard to be funny, and may succeed with small children, but not so much for adults.  The strangest part of the film is the Mom pig who creates an automated system for taking care of her large family while she is at rehearsals.  In a single night she creates a majorly complex auto feed, auto laundry system that would make NASA proud.  She needs to be an inventor, not a singer.

What's it like?: It is like a combination of the backstage stories to reality TV singing competition shows such as American Idol and the written stories of TV series such as Glee, but with animals… much fewer animals than what was advertised in the trailer. It’s not original. Children and teenagers could be fooled into liking it due to its  numerous pop songs, but there is insufficient story and there are not enough good laughs. As a results, adults would find it middling.
>
Cons: >
1. For much of the film, it seemed like there was nothing special going on and that the film was merely propped up by the numerous recognisable pop songs. The last 20 minutes was much better, but even then there were only covers of pop songs apart from one new original song. Even so, that original song was not memorable.
>
2. One would think that the film would cover the long story behind each season of a reality TV singing competition show, but the potential number of ‘contestants’ were chopped down drastically at the first cut, to just seven acts! That seemed too few and too lacking in variety and talents. It was as if there was insufficient budget to get enough famous voice actors to voice for the animals! >
Pros: Cons #2 ends up being a master stroke. There could have been too many acts if the format of American Idol was followed. More is not always better. More could end up stalling the film by having one pop song come after another. With fewer ‘contestants’, the end of the film felt sharper and sooner, which is good. >
How would the different age groups rate it?
Children: Excellent.
Teens: Good.
Young adults: Average
Medium age adults: Average
Old adults: Average.

My rating: 3/5 (no half scores). Save you money and watch it on TV."

There's little genuine humor, but there is a touch of heart. On the other hand, there are LOTS of songs, some with spirited arrangements and good performances.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lizzie/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Bertaut1,"Jan 1, 2019",6,"Could do with a bit more vitality, but the acting is superb

Written by Bryce Kass, and directed by Craig William Macneill, Lizzie is based on the case of Lizzie Borden, who was accused and subsequently acquitted of the axe murders of her father and stepmother in Massachusetts in 1892. A revisionist take on the material, the film presents Borden as a protofeminist lashing out against patriarchal oppression, homophobia, and sexual assault. And although the languid pace will alienate many, whilst the liberties it takes with historical facts will irk others, there is much to praise here.

One of most interesting aspects of Lizzie is its narrative structure. Beginning on August 4 just as the (unseen) bodies are discovered, it then flashes back six months to the arrival of housemaid Bridget Sullivan (Kristen Stewart), building up to August 4 again. This time we see the bodies, but not the murders. It then jumps forward to the trial, before once again flashing back to August 4, this time showing us the actual killing. This structure allows the film to briefly cover the trial, whilst still employing the murders as the dénouement. It also allows the narrative to build tension around an event which the audience already knows is coming.

Aesthetically, Noah Greenberg's cinematography is particularly laudable. The film rarely ventures outside the Borden house, with the photography giving rise to a restrictive and claustrophobic mise en scène. Often framing Borden in windows, doorways, and behind railings, whilst using shallow focus to flatten backgrounds, the sense is that this is a woman living a confined life with little room to move. When she first kisses the maid, Bridget Sullivan (Kristen Stewart), the camera pulls back to reveal that Lizzie's father Andrew (Jamey Sheridan) is watching them - even in this moment of release, they are still trapped in his domain.

Assisting Greenberg's photography is Ruy García's sound design. Of particular note are the floorboards, which creak with the slightest touch, making any kind of clandestine interaction between Borden and Sullivan virtually impossible, and thus contributing to the sense of the household as a prison. Enhancing this even further, is the lack of aural warmth, with footsteps and voices echoing and bouncing off the walls due to the lack of soft surfaces.

As a narrative of female empowerment (albeit of the homicidal variety), most of the film's main themes relate to combating the patriarchal strictures of the Gilded Age, represented primarily by Andrew, his brother-in-law John (Denis O'Hare), and his wife Abby (Fiona Shaw), who reinforces patriarchal hypocrisy by unquestioningly submitting to it. Presenting Borden as a woman driven to her wit's end, with few practical options in a society that looks down on her because she is unwed and in her 30s, the film depicts a free-spirit living in a cage, yearning for agency, a protofeminist actively rebelling against the dominion of men. Presenting her and Sullivan's relationship as an illicit romance which they had to hide because of the moral bigotry of the age, the film adopts a #MeToo sensibility, as they fight back against self-righteous judgement, unchecked abuse, and socially sanctioned oppression.

There are, however, some sizeable problems. For one, the film lacks energy, and the slow pacing will leave some viewers bored to tears. Additionally, apart from Sevigny and Stewart, the rest of the cast is wasted. Perhaps the most egregious problem, however, is that the film seems as war with itself. On the one hand, it wants to be an elegant, period-appropriate tale of women attempting to take their destinies into their own hands, but on the other, it wants to present a modern story of murder and homosexual women. At times, such as the superb depiction of the murders themselves, you can feel the modern sensibilities rise to the surface, but for the most part, they're stifled by the hushed austerity of a more muted milieu. Additionally, Kass's script tips the scale in Borden's favour too much (Andrew is not just an authoritarian homophobe, but a rapist; there's also John's creepy intimations, Abby's refusal to stand up for her step-daughters, and Borden's protofeminist humanitarianism). Weighing the scales so decisively drains the film of ambiguity and much of its vitality, presenting a binary story of righteous good slaying hypocritical evil, rather than a murder with many facets. Lizzie tells the story of an initially powerless victim who lashes out and, quite literally, slays patriarchal authority. A Gothic tale told from a #MeToo perspective, it tries to be many things at once - a revisionist history, a feminist tract, a championing of homosexuality, a murder mystery, a period drama - but ends up kind of falling into a no man's land between genres. Still though, there are aspects that are enjoyable, if you can look past the enervating pace."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lizzie/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,TVJerry,"Sep 25, 2018",6,"Lizzie the lezzie! That's the angle of this latest take on notorious axe murderer Lizzie Borden. Chloë Sevigny plays the frustrated daughter with her typically flat delivery. The combination of her amorous relationship with the house maid (Kristen Stewart) and the increasingly cruel actions of her father drive her to the legendary hacking. There's a lovely period ambience that's echoed by the subdued period pacing. While danger bubbles under the surface, it never builds to any sort of boiling point. Somber and subdued makes for an interesting story, but not much of an emotionally compelling one."

I can say for a Netflix movie it isn't terrible. I know that is glowing praise, but if I were to pay to see this in theaters I would be less then generous to it. The Lovebirds is a romantic comedy where if you watch the trailer you have seen all the jokes basically. That is a huge problem that trailer had me thinking that this film was going to be a side splitting good time. Instead I got a passable comedy. I do mean it is passable due to the fact you will laugh at some of the jokes... but not many. The plot focuses on a couple who end up being accessories to a murder from a guy claiming to be a cop, and the comedy ensues. Some may find Kumail Nanjiani annoying due to how he is complaining the entire film. It didn't bother me, but be warned he is the exact character he was in Stuber. Issa Rae playing (his girlfriend) actually has the best jokes in the movie. These two are likable just the movie isn't that funny.

This was a little hard to rate as the film equally has stuff I liked and disliked.

Jokes are hit-and-miss. The funniest parts are derived from investigating the mystery (we know who did it but not why.) Things can get dark, and it is at the sure unexpectedness of this darkness that the movie works best.

The jokes that don't work are often at the points that the focus is more on the personal lives of the characters, which isn't as strong. There is a conflict set up between the couple that never feels real enough. It doesn't help that the jokes are often stretched. So if you don't like one, expect it to go on for a while. There is a little too much observational humor and the characters overreacting to things.

Though they can't make the weak bit work, Rae and Nanjiani are good in this and have chemistry together.

I was on the fence about how I felt about this. I actually recommend you watch this because I feel that there'd be a good amount of people who'd prefer this more than me. Even if you don't like it, I think it's more likely to be a miss with you rather than something you outright dislike."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lovebirds/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Stream2BigScree,"May 23, 2020",6,"There is a typical comedy that seems to come out every summer that involves a couple in a rut, a strange turn of events, and its all resolved over the course of a crazy night out. Steve Carrell and Tina Fey romped through it as a boring married couple in Date Night. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams joked about in it as a buttoned-up couple in Game Night. Now, we have Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani in the Netflix premiere of The Lovebirds trading barbs as a couple at the end of their rope on this fateful night. If you have seen one of these movies, then you have seen them all; in these action/crime/romance comedies the entertainment value, chemistry of the leads and the humor determine whether they are worth the time. Let’s see how The Lovebirds fares.

For The Lovebirds, the premise is pretty basic and set forth in the trailer. Rae and Nanjiani play a bickering couple who have run out of patience for each other and have lost the excitement in their relationship. On one evening out in New Orleans, a policeman commandeers their vehicle and proceeds to murder a cyclist. Was that a real policeman? Is this couple now accomplices in this crime? Are they in danger and how do they prove they aren’t the criminals? Hijinks ensue.

The Lovebirds is directed by comedy vet, Michael Showalter, who previously directed Nanjiani in The Big Sick, which is a more thoughtful comedy available on Amazon Prime. It is a face paced movie. The catalyst event happens in the first 10 minutes, but from there, it does get a bit episodic but it moves at a good clip. As the couple follows the clues to the next set piece, the comedy doesn’t really ratchet up anything. We meet new characters and there a few surprises near the end, but those characters aren’t very memorable as they are just breadcrumbs along the way. The movie needs more tension or a heightening of reality because otherwise it doesn’t set itself apart for any others in this genre.

The chemistry between Rae and Nanjiani is good though. Each plays a modern archetype. Rae is the image obsessed woman who works at a marketing firm and her boyfriend isn’t exciting enough for her. Nanjiani is the straight-laced, documentary filmmaker who’s jealousy bubbles just beneath the surface. There is a meet-cute between Rae and Nanjiani early on that doesn’t really show why they are in this relationship, but the back-and-forth between the two works and is funny throughout the film. Without these two, this film would have been boring noise just to play in the background. I can’t say that the film itself is funny, but the leads do their best to make the most of it.

Ultimately, if this movie were in the theaters, I would say wait until it is on some streaming service. In our current climate, since The Lovebirds has premiered on Netflix, it is a decent film to watch on a casual night at home. Grab a bowl of popcorn. Curl up with your boo and see if you would make it through this hellacious night unscathed. Besides it is less than 90 minutes, you have that time – I know you do."

And although many times it's said that the journey is better than the destination, in this case it's not so because the journey despite being built with respectable quality, never rises above the average."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/on-the-basis-of-sex/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,MarkHReviews,"Jan 12, 2019",6,"One would think “On the Basis of Sex” would have the inside track for offering the definitive take on Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  After all, the screenplay was written by Ginsburg’s nephew, Daniel Stiepelman, whose script was discussed, reviewed and edited by Ginsburg and her daughter, Jane.  Despite this inside information and the artistic license granted this fictionalized version of Ginsburg’s life, the resulting movie does not compare favorably to last year’s more comprehensive, more powerful documentary “R.B.G.”

It’s curious that the film focuses so narrowly – a few scenes of Ginsburg at Harvard Law, her early days in NYC beginning in 1959 and an emphasis on her first major gender equality case, Moritz v. IRS, which was argued before the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in 1972.  Between 1973 and 1976, Ginsburg argued six gender discrimination cases before the US Supreme Court, five of them successfully.  One wonders why the film focuses solely on the beginning of her work on gender equality, while giving no real attention to the legal precedents she helped create for women over succeeding years.  For many, it is Ginsburg’s relentless pursuit of gender equality, accomplished case by case, brick by brick, that has made her so admired.  However, this narrow focus does allow the film to paint a painfully vivid picture of the barriers she had to overcome.  According to this film, women didn’t just cope with glass ceilings, in many cases they lived in glass cages.

In general, the cast is first-rate.  As Marty Ginsburg, the ever-supportive spouse, Armie Hammer taps into the same thoughtful, soulful character for which he received a Golden Globe nomination last year for “Call Me By Your Name.”  At key points, Cailee Spaeny, as Ginsburg’s daughter Jane, offers a refreshingly in-your-face activism and assertiveness.  Jane’s personal power shows clearly that the gift of independent thought and capacity to question everything – which RBG received from her mother – was passed on to the next generation.  Unfortunately, Felicity Jones in the lead role just seems out of place.  Jones was wonderful as Stephen Hawking’s wife in “The Theory of Everything” (2014).  Here, she seems to be laboring to tone down her irrepressible perkiness.  Or, perhaps, it’s just that RBG, in this rendering, is just so humorless.

The film is particularly incapable of treating the traditionalists who oppose feminism as anything other than bad caricatures.  In one early scene, Law School Dean Erwin Griswold (Sam Waterston) invites the nine female member of the incoming class to dinner at his home.  Once seated, he asks each to introduce herself and explain why she is taking the place of a deserving man.  It all comes across with the subtle nuance of Gallagher hitting a watermelon with a sledgehammer.

Many years ago, I recall my father, a thoughtful, decent man, saying that he would be willing to help fund higher educator for his granddaughters “should they prove educable.”  From today’s perspective, it’s jarring to think about that stereotype permeating the thinking of reasonable people.  As much as any other individual today, Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been responsible for changing that point of view.  Unfortunately, “On the Basis of Sex,” fails to do her justice."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/on-the-basis-of-sex/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Jan 7, 2019",6,"On the evening news they announced, that for the first time in her 25 years as a Supreme Court Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg would miss hearing oral arguments but would read all the notes taken and vote as was expected of her. After two operations for cancer and bouts of chemo she still shows the fortitude that saw her through a life of having to prove herself.

""On The Basis of Sex"" opens with Ginsberg attending a class of Harvard Law School, only one of nine women in a class of more than 500 men. We see the happy and equal, possibly more equal for her, marriage with her loving, smart husband who knows his wife can do anything she wants and he is there to back her up. For the first hour of the film we see had badly women were treated in the work force, along in many other aspects of everyday life, the comfortable marriage of the Ginsbergs, their children of which the oldest is a daughter who seems to motivate her mother to go a step further than she might be ready to go and how it lead to the Supreme Court.

It is in the last 45 minutes that we see Ginsburg in 1975 arguing her first case regarding gender equality but it is for a man, not a woman, who as a caretaker for his mother has been denied $296 as a tax deduction.

""On The Basis of Sex"" is written by Ruth Bader Ginsberg's nephew, Daniel Stiepleman, but as much research as I did I wasn't able to find out who his parents were but he obviously admired, if not worshiped, Martin and Ruth Ginsburg so both are presented as perfect people.

Felicity Jones as Ruth Bader Ginsburg really has a one note role but adds what she can to it. Anyone who saw last years documentary ""RBG"" or has seen her interviewed knows the lady is certainly not a one note person. Armie Hammer, as Martin, is excellent as the man who believes in his wife while Cailee Spaeny does a standout job as their teenage daughter Jane.

Though it is hard, at first, to accept Sam Waterston as the hard, condescending Dean of Harvard Erwin Griswold, he is just one of the men who thought as he did, including the 3 judges who hear Ginsburg's gender discrimination case.

Along with Hammer, Justin Theroux, as a ACLU lawyer, and Christian Mulkey, as the defendant in the  case, are effective in playing the 'good guys'.

Kathy Bates in the role of Dorothy Kenyon, an early civil liberties fighter, lawyer and judge, shines in her two scenes.

The director, Mimi Leder, does a by the numbers job and somewhere along the line the production staff saw a 'blue' New York. Clothes, signs, lights, door fronts, let alone Ginsburg's major outfit, is blue!

""On The Basis of Sex"" is an enjoyable love story, an interesting gender civil rights lesson, but most of all it shows how a person, a woman, lead a successful life in spite of all that was thrown in her way and gave us a woman who today is admired by many, including her enemies who want to get her off the Court which is a compliment.

I recommend a double bill movie night of ""On The Basis of Sex"" for a Hollywood version of Ruth Baded Ginsburg and ""RBG"" to discover who the woman was yesterday and is today."

Or à la suite d'un concours de circonstances impromptu, voilà-t-y pas qu'il flingue le fiston très con de son parrain... pour protéger son fiston à lui qu'il ne voit plus depuis des années !

Alors, pensez donc, le parrain a beau être un pote de 30 ans de notre pauvre Liam, il n'en est pas moins super vénère : il réclame sa tête mais aussi celle de son fils (le fils de l'alcoolo irlandais -pléonasme-, j'espère que vous suivez quand même) parce qu'il est du genre ""dent pour dent"" et qu'en plus il a la dent dure, le vieux mafieux.

Et putain, il est vieux le parrain incarné avec aplomb par Ed Harris, dans les 80 piges au compteur environ mais on ne compte plus à cet âge-là. D'ailleurs, notre grand Liam ne se fait plus tout jeune lui non plus et le retraité enchaîne les bastons et les fusillades comme un jeune chien fou dans un jeu de quilles. Papy, tu vois, il envoit du bois.

Un flicard a aussi la dent dure à son égard, joué par Vincent D'Onofrio, préretraité ou presque, vétéran de ""New York section criminelle"", mais également le marquant ""Engagé Baleine"" de... Full Metal Jacket ! oué ça remonte à... pffiou !

Attendez, ce n'est pas terminé, un autre Papy fait une apparition, quasi-fantomatique : on dirait Dieu le père en personne, environ 90 balais... ouais, c'est bien Nick Nolte, vous ne rêvez pas ! il m'a fait peur.

Alors le film qui se déroule surtout la nuit se veut un modèle de rédemption des truands à qui on apprend plus à faire la grimace... et bien sûr la rivalité de deux fortes personnalités qui se respectent mais s'affrontent à cause des circonstances. Certes, ce n'est pas Heat mais on sent une inspiration assez nette à cet égard.

Si l'histoire tient ma foi tout-à-fait debout, elle titube sensiblement dans la psychologie de ses personnages trop exagérée, trop forcée et le scénario qui aligne poursuites et bastons sans crier gare est du même acabit : on se sent un peu trop souvent dans une stathamerie ou autre production Luc Besson, ce qui n'est pas un compliment, non, non...

Pour autant, on ne s'ennuie jamais là-dedans et nos vieux donnent le meilleur d'eux-mêmes, Liam et Ed en premier : leur expérience crève l'écran. On passerait même l'éponge sur le caractère outrancier du film si sa réalisation était au moins à la hauteur, ce qu'elle n'est pas avec son montage cut et zoomé, rendant l'action confuse et désordonnée.

Il reste un film pas désagréable avec quelques moments touchants mais globalement dépassé par son ambition : la rédemption du truand est en effet un sujet difficile et délicat qui ne souffre pas la médiocrité... Trop emporté, Night Run n'a pas acquis la sagesse nécessaire."

Though my standards are now set low for most of Neeson's silly action flicks, I am always pleasantly surprised when they turn out to be not dreadful.

The story is typically inane and pointless, but Run All Night balances that with its furious pace and tension, well shot and decently choreographed fight scenes, and its above average performances from the cast, if not from Neeson himself, whose acting skills continue to fail in convincing me that he ever cares about anyone he's trying to save."

Overall, I liked this movie, and I think it represents a decent ending to the Bridget Jones trilogy. It's not a very good movie, but it's warm, it has a funny story and gives us back most of the characters we like. Personally, I like this movie more than its predecessor, which seemed more worn and soulless. In this movie, the unthinkable happens and Bridget got pregnant… but she doesn't know who the father is! On the one hand, it could be Mark Darcy, her eternal love, but it could also be Jack, a one-night stand she had at a festival.

The movie is predictably the last in which we'll see Bridget Jones and her adventures. Not only is the formula already quite worn out, but the actors have also aged and are now on another level of their lives. The biggest problem with this film, in fact, is the predictability of its script, where we can foresee with some certainty what will happen. Even who is the child's father! The jokes are nothing new, but sometimes they work, and the film is not happy about making us laugh, but it also doesn't upset us either. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the same chemistry among the trio of main actors that was observed in the past. The film has a series of uninteresting sub-plots, placed to fill time and space, because nothing relevant comes from any of them.

Again, Renee Zellwegger returns to one of the characters that brought her notoriety and fortune, but the actress already accuses her age, with visible wrinkles and a lack of joviality that the character also gradually assumes. She is a good actress, however, and gives us another very competent job, closing in the best way her work. At his side, a mature but elegant Colin Firth remains fresh and impeccable in the role of Darcy. Cast in this film, Patrick Dempsey did a satisfying job, but somewhat lukewarm, as was his character, an algorithmic intellectual who made his fortune with a social networking site. Emma Thompson is a good comedian, but the character is too serious for her to really put to use the comedic skills we recognize in her. Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent are safe bets, but they are rarely really taken advantage of. Sarah Solemani is also a nice addition, but also adds little to the film.

Once again, the film takes on its British credits with a discreet but effective and functional cinematography, making the best use of the good scenery and also the excellent filming locations selected for the film. We have a good balance of light and shadow, good colors and excellent editing, with the film not wasting time or dragging. The costumes are also very good, and the soundtrack does its job well, without standing out or disappointing."

Helen Fielding’s down-to-earth 20/30/40-something creation is back, still struggling with life, and about to embark on her most extravagant adventure yet – a baby, whose paternal genes she’s not quite sure.

What did I think?

Let me start with a disclaimer – I hate Renee Zellweger in this role. I loved the books, and always thought the casting was deeply offensive to legions of great British actresses – her ridiculously twitching terribly-accented Bridget did nothing for me. Surprising, then, that I found this sequel to be rather good. Zellweger’s now utterly-toxin-ravaged face is difficult to watch, and she still overplays Jones obscenely, but there are some seriously funny – proper “pah!” LOL moments – and some brilliant turns from Colin Firth, Patrick Dempsey and, particularly, Emma Thompson as the obstetrician who, God bless her, is aging beautifully (i.e. naturally).

It drags a bit – two hours?? – but it’s got just enough of the good stuff to keep you going, thanks in no small part to Fielding’s work on the screenplay and Shazzer picking up the director’s reins once again. I’m shocking myself by saying this, but it’s worth a watch!"

She is thinner than before, has a good job as a TV producer and without any prospects in the romance department. One of her past suitors, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) has died and she broke up with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) who got married.

As only as movies can do it Mark reappears in her life just as a new man Jack Qwant (Patrick Dempsey) appears, she goes to bed with both (NO! Not at the same time!) and guess what happens! (Read the title of the film folks!) We, she and they spend the next hour and a half (out of 2 hours) trying to figure which one is the father. Yes there is an easy way to find out who the father is but then there would be no movie.

Should you not be able to figure out who the father is by the scene in the Italian restaurant you haven’t seen a lot of movies.

Zellweger’s British accent gets a little too heavy at times, Dempsey seems to never have shaved during the movie constantly having that ugly 5 o’clock shadow and Firth’s saving grace is that he holds back with the smiles so when he shows one he lights up the film.

The supporting cast does their job and the film provides a few, very few, laughs, some slapstick and almost no feelings.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/elvis-nixon/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,ScarlettMi,"Nov 23, 2016",6,"This movie is saved by the strength of Michael Shannon's performance. Kevin Spacey is good as well, but if it weren't for the deep sense of melancholy that surrounds Shannon's Elvis, I don't think the film would have had any weight to it at all.

There are a couple of chuckles to be had here and there based around the absurdity of the life that Elvis leads and the juxtaposition of him and Nixon. Certainly that has to be part of the reason why the picture of the two of them that inspired this movie proves so popular. The way Elvis disarms and interacts with Nixon made for an entertaining exchange. Neither man comes across as very relatable but we can understand why they might relate to one another.

The movie never really takes off, but in the end it does work to paint a sad and affecting portrait of Elvis. I haven't checked, but it felt as though it was adapted from a stage play. Whenever Michael Shannon was given the opportunity to just talk for a bit, the movie was at its strongest. I also thought the relationship with Jerry was well done in showing what it would be like to live alongside someone who constantly **** up all the oxygen in whatever room he's in but still makes you feel special for having been there.

It's a solid character study of Elvis but whenever the story veers away from Shannon, the film gets weaker."

Much more in-line with the original film, to the point that nothing is mentioned of the wacky sequel, Cars 3 is a natural, role-reversing progression of the themes presented during the franchise's first lap. It can be blunt and obvious, but at heart this is a kid's movie and I appreciate the effort to mix a little extra meaning into the destruction derbies and Hot Wheel paint jobs.

The whole package looks great, as one might expect from a major Pixar effort. There's a ton of variety in the scenery, which is just stunning (the cars themselves occasionally seem glaringly flat by contrast), and the race scenes (particularly McQueen's big crash at the end of the first act) are vivid enough that you'd be forgiven for overlooking the giant eyeballs behind each windscreen.

I wouldn't place it in the pantheon of studio greats, but it's at least a deserving successor to Cars 1, if not an essential conclusion to that story. They could've just doubled down on Tow Mater and his international slapstick hijinx, raked in the bucks and called it a day, but instead we received something a little more contemplative and deserving of a feature-length.

The racing sequences are particularly well-executed, capturing the speed and intensity of the track. However, it's not a groundbreaking leap forward from the first film, feeling more like a pit stop for the animation studio rather than a triumphant return to form.

Soundtrack:
Now, the soundtrack. Much like the first film, ""Cars 3"" sticks with a country-tinged sound, bringing back the familiar tones of Americana. While it may not reach the heights of Pixar's best musical offerings, it complements the film's racing theme and provides a steady backdrop without becoming a distracting pit crew member.

Story and Characters
Let's talk about the narrative. ""Cars 3"" brings Lightning McQueen back into the driver's seat, but this time he's facing the inevitable: aging and newer, sleeker models. The film attempts to explore themes of mentorship, legacy, and the passage of time, injecting some much-needed depth into the series. However, the narrative feels somewhat formulaic, hitting familiar beats that we've seen in countless sports movies. It's like they took a page from the underdog playbook and followed it to the letter.

Themes
Now, the themes. Cars 3 tries to deliver a message about the importance of passing the torch, but it occasionally veers into overly sentimental territory. 

The film's attempt to balance nostalgia with a fresh perspective is commendable, but it doesn't quite achieve the emotional resonance of Pixar's more impactful **** the grand Pixar spectrum, ""Cars 3"" is a respectable comeback after the wrong turn of ""Cars 2."" It steers the franchise back towards the emotional resonance that Pixar is known for, even if it doesn't break any new ground. 

It's a solid conclusion to the trilogy, giving Lightning McQueen a fitting farewell lap. It's a competent sequel that puts the series back on track, but it lacks the innovative spark of Pixar's best work."

It's pretty clear that Cars is the weakest Pixar movie franchise in terms of storytelling, character development and overall quality: The first Cars was not Pixar's worst but far from the best, Cars 2 was god-awful and Cars 3 is surprisingly a BIG improvement over the last film, it manages to be a good movie.

Cars 3 has amazing animation (as expected from Pixar), a generic but decent plot with actual conflict this time, having Lightning McQueen now struggle to stay relevant against a new generation of hi-tech racers. It has decent writing and it feels like this was an ""apology letter""  to Pixar fans, this is noticeable with the fact that Mater now has like a couple of minutes of screen time. The worst character of the last film, barely appears in this movie, thank God. I have some problems with the story and characters, like the way this ends, the ending was extremely predictable and hilariously ridiculous. Some characters from the previous movies (besides Mater) barely have any screentime, serve no purpose to the plot and feel like shoehorned in and the new characters lack development or charisma, they are pretty forgettable.

This is obviously not a great movie, it's actually decent and has a purpose in the story of the franchise. I enjoyed the movie and it isn't anything too memorable or something I would rewatch."

I have never seen the original television series, but I came across and found it interesting to try, only to realise in my watch that it was not what I thought of it. Yeah, definitely my disadvantage was that I didn't know the characters, the universe and all the basics. Those who loved the show might enjoy it better, since they know what to expect from it. I was like looking for a proper intro. The introduction of everything, as I'm not familiar with anything out of it. But it did not come, the story just went on and on from the opening itself. I was confused what's going on, who is who and et al.

It took almost half of the film to be comfortable with the scenario of the tale. Once I was there, I thought it was funny in places, yet I did not feel like to have a laugh. Again, I blame myself for missing out the fun for not knowing them very well. It never occurred to me before. I have seen many films that proceeded by its television series which I haven't seen. It looked short and the pace was excellent, so I did not get bored, except not getting the overall film properly. Otherwise, I would have rated it better. I think the people like me should be careful while picking it. Other than that it is an okay film, not a bad film.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/absolutely-fabulous-the-movie/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,madmovieman,"Nov 29, 2016",5,"It’s very rare for a sitcom to really translate well onto the big screen, and this is unfortunately yet another example. Whilst I think the original Ab Fab series is great fun, this feature-length edition a good decade and and a half later on from the original run’s end is far from any of the laughs that made the show so fun. With a dull screenplay and poor comedy (not to mention the cardinal sin of celebrity cameos), Absolutely Fabulous The Movie is anything but.

Now, the biggest issue with the film is that it’s just not that funny. I’ll admit there are a couple of laughs here and there, but nothing hugely memorable or good enough to get you in the mood for a great comedy. In the show, so much of the humour came from Patsy and Eddie’s excessively narcissistic personalities, as well as their unorthodox relationship with Saffy, Eddie’s daughter.

However, rather than being able to laugh at all of that, this film makes all of the show’s best qualities simply irritating. Similarly to a couple of revival episodes over the past few years, the film is a consistently underwhelming and irritating watch, because it rehashes old jokes again and again, and also indulges itself in the modern era in a way that doesn’t suit its characters or situation at all. It’s a format that seemed to work back in the 90s, but doesn’t translate well into the present.

Whilst Joanna Lumley, Jennifer Saunders and Julia Sawalha all put in the same shifts as they did in the original show, the script here just means they’re not as entertaining. The predictability of so many of the jokes right from the start makes everything feel so lacklustre, and it’s very difficult to keep interested or hopeful over the course of 90 minutes, instead of 30.

This film is in general a big mess. The script’s comedy is very poor, and the story isn’t much better, featuring a billion conveniences just to get the characters into ‘hilarious’ situations. It used to feel so organic and simple, but the plot here feels incredibly manufactured and predictable, another hugely disappointing element.

And then, there’s the nail in the coffin: the celebrity cameos. Of all the worst things a film can do, this always shows a script that’s got no ideas, and is simply relying on an equivalent of fan service to get laughs out of you. In a horribly similar way to this year’s other celebrity overdose, Zoolander 2, Ab Fab The Movie keeps throwing hordes of celebrities at you in an attempt to mask the script’s complete lack of comedic class, but it never works, and makes for an even more dull and underwhelming watch.

Overall, I thought that this was a really disappointing film. With so much talent coming from the original series, this film is perfect evidence of how a sitcom doesn’t work stretched to 90 minutes, thanks to its dull, unoriginal screenplay, poor comedy, and excess of celebrity cameos."

If you're a fan of the movie you'll appreciate that most things are exactly the same: the family is back, their habits haven't changed and the humor ranges from clever to broad to absurd. There are dozens of cameos, but if you're not up on English pop culture many may go unappreciated. The costumes are wonderfully over the top. Other than a parade of celebs, nothing about the big screen version is stepped up…just more semi-outrageous antics from the women who made it fun to be degenerate."

Being a B movie, it is not that bad. It is eligible for some minor exceptions and if you consider that while watching it, then it does not disappoint much. Yes, there are many similar films like this, but what makes it somewhat special is that it is quite freely explored its contents without stressing out on detailing everything. I meant it was a simple road adventure film and you would feel it very familiar yet you will realise that it is not worth criticing it.

The actors were decent, but expected much better. Directed by a newcomer who had written many screenplays similar this theme. Like I said it was quite predictable, at a time decently enjoyable with a few laughs now and then, especially that Mexican police station scene was hilarious. You might get a million reasons to dislike it, but you achieve nothing from it. According to me it was surely a decent watch, hence not a must see, but if you do, then don't take it seriously, try to have fun within its limits.

I am not saying the film was terrible, but the timing was bad. There are loads of great sci-fi films were made recently and still coming out. So to compete with them, they have to go through alteration, even if they loose the origins of their film's theme concept. This story is same as many similar themed flicks. For me, it looked like a mini Superman film, but made for kids.

The best thing about it was, keeping everything simple. And then the pace, which actually somewhat saved the film. I hooked to it from the beginning till the conclusion, but familiarity is what killed my interest and entertainment. The characters were okay, not developed well enough. But keeping young audience in mind, it does good. Because going deep is unnecessary stretch.

The story of a high school boy who transferred back to a small town where has born. As he begins to hear a lot about his father from the local people, he becomes motivated to know more about him. But one day when something goes wrong, the next day he wakes up with great power. Not knowing how to handle it, he befriends with an unusual creature and together they fight those who are after them.

Initially I thought it was related to 'Real Steel', but realised only while watching it it is completely different. From the director of 'Sorority Row', I think he did nothing wrong. Those who watch less films would enjoy it better. Visually okay, with all those graphics. Since it is PG13, I would say the target audience is the little ones. So from their perspective, it is acceptable. But I warn the grownups, stay away, or be like them while watching it, in order to get entertained.

Looks like inspired by 'Serial Mom'. When a little, strange but a happy family who are living by the storybook of their own was threatened by the dark side of the life, they are ready to jump into the hell to save it. They have ignited it, but the only concern is how to end it all for good.

Other than IMDb where it stands average, the movie was slammed very badly by the critics and moviegoers. I have seen even worse than this one. So to me it is an average except the end, otherwise below average. Yes, the conclusion was terrible, seems like they don't want a continuation. I mean they wanted to end it all here itself. It is a watchable, but simply not the best one.

The big reveal was what brought the movie down for me personally, but I thought that it fit well with the narrative that they had designed for the back story. I will say though that they also borrowed heavily from the TV series ""Lost."" Right down to the casting of someone who I thought for a second was a digitally de-aged Matthew Fox at the first shot he was in. All in all if you like lite-horror and can handle a slight grade above a B movie then this should be an okay watch. Fun even with the scenes with Dax and Jimmy.

This weekend we were able to view Fantasy Island, as well. Fantasy Island is a horror adaptation/perversion of the old TV show from the 70's. The movie stars a cast of characters headlined by Lucy Hale, Michael Pena and Maggie Q. But should people go to the theater to view this movie?

Let's start with the easiest way to describe this movie, which is if Shutter Island had a baby with Inception and one of the grandparents was Fantasy Island the TV show. If you've seen those two movies before, WHICH I STRONGLY RECOMMEND DOING IF YOU HAVEN'T, then you know just how deceptive, convoluted, and involved this movie is trying to be. Now, that description could be a compliment but in this situation, it is not. Fantasy Island does not measure up to either movie yet it essentially steals elements of both. Even though it is billed as a horror film, the viewer is deceived because Fantasy Island falls more into the Shutter Island psychological thriller realm than pure horror. The other elements of the movie fall more into the Inception Sci-Fi/Thriller realm. Either way, Fantasy Island fails to have a distinct intent and it's supposed genre was never fully embraced.

Furthermore, the movie is so twisted that it straightens itself out before the two final twist reveals. Just listen to how confusing that statement was. Fantasy Island tried so hard to keep viewers on their toes that they ruin their own anti-climatic twists. I will give credit to the producers that the twists were still executed well but they lacked umph. The viewer is left unafraid due to the overly complicated storytelling and plot developments. It would have served the movie well to just be classified more like the previous movies mentioned, rather than not delivering on the horror genre.

Even with those issues, the cast was sub-par. Individually, the actors were average, but collectively, the actors were still just average. Lucy Hale was by far the best performance at times but still was annoying. I feel Michael Pena was underutilized and or the writing and directing just squandered the possibility of the character. In fact, all of the ensemble cast had issues of being extremely annoying. Now, that I think about it, the writing in this movie was just poor overall. AH HA, found the issue.

With that said, de plane de plane… *clears throat* excuse me. Fantasy Island is a letdown for a horror movie but in a way could have succeeded as a Sci-Fi, psychological thriller. The storyline is not original, which is why they tried to make it so confusing. Or should I say a fantasy within a fantasy within a fantasy. Did they just successfully create an inception?! Either way, you can see this at a matinee time but you’re best served waiting for this to come on HBO Go or a streaming service."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-family-man/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,KaptenVideo,"Aug 1, 2017",6,"Ah, the new movie starring Gerard Butler, the poor man’s Clive Owen, always up for some good all-American entertainment that makes you think but also makes you smile.
This one’s about a headhunter whose life revolves around closing deals in survival-of-the-fittest boiler room. He battles his top rival for control of the company, but then his oldest child falls seriously ill.
Also starring, Gretchen Mol as the loving but ever-suffering wife, Willem Dafoe as the ruthless boss, Alison Brie as the rival and Alfred Molina as the token solid supporting male character.
First and foremost, „A Family Man“ is a genre movie, which means it’s produced and put together of cliches in hope of finding a suitable mainstream audience.
The approach is pretty solid one, using several drama subgenres in order to appeal to wider circle of cinema-goers, including sick child story, a middle class American success story, finding yourself again story and some „Wall Street“ type high-octane competence porn.
The execution is actually pretty solid too. The able cast are doing their darndest best to act through all the material, and there’s a lot of it.
108 minute movie may feel quite a bit longer, at least for those who have seen way too many movies to take all these cliches and workmanlike storytelling seriously.
On the other hand, those who still watch movies as just a nice way of passing time, or aren’t tired of bland dramas made of middle-class dreams and aspirations, can definitely find some entertainment here.
They don’t even have to think how to feel because the movie manipulates you in all the right directions at the right time.
I am taking a wild guess that ""A Family Man"" is most suitable for girlish audience, but it will also surely feel in the right place when it’s 2 am and you’re desperately trying to find something new to watch with Butler starring in it.
He’s a doing a fine job too, the whole result relies on his manly charm and grunting.
All in all, there’s nothing wrong with „A Family Man“. It’s just there’s nothing terribly exciting either, with the creative bar set relatively low and all.
I hope I didn’t sound too ironic here or something, I quite liked the movie for what it is."

Honestly don't know how Gerard Butler got to such a low profile movie, but despite his (or his agent's) choice he does a great job at delivering his character, I think that it fit him perfectly. The directors style in cinematography was just the usual stuff, nothing new. Despite the two protagonists the rest of the characters writing was painfully average, and the script was cliche. The visual looked very weird in some instances when it was CGI, because of the poor way it was generated. The pacing issue is present here as well, although it can keep the audience engaged the whole way through the movie. The plot is simple, and the base of it was recycled so many times that is painful in movie since we learned about global warming. This is the message as well of the movie, but there are just so many that deliver the message in a better fashion. The movie although it was entertaining for most of the part, it wasn't as much fun to watch it.
Overall it's a slightly below average, because of the fact that this is nothing new and does every single mistake an average movie does, plus some other elements lack as well."

The movie is filled with profanity-laced sex puns, shock humor, and gross out gags. It's shear devotion to raunch and vulgarity does lead to some amusing moments and laugh-out-loud funny one-liners, but the movie is still hindered by the fact that it's just not very clever. Not even having legendary actor Robert De Niro and Zac Efron, who is ever-growing in popularity in this kind of scene, as the leads can save ""Dirty Grandpa"" from feeling rather thrown together. The movie tries for some of that feel good, family sticking together magic with a side of ""just live"" message. None of that ever really works out. The movie is about the crudity, everything else second. While this does lead to a rather cheap feeling experience, it's something that probably works in Dirty Grandpa's favor. It's evident that the people behind this aren't exactly the deepest of people. **** jokes are right up their alley, and hey, they're good at making them. Mostly. While it's not always the funniest or even the most original film out there in the ever-widening sea of R-rated comedies, there are some laughs to be had. Plus, all of the actors were totally on board with the project. There are some surprisingly good performances here. The supporting cast is also pretty great. Particularly Jason Mantzoukas, who regularly brings some of the biggest laughs. Everyone onscreen is so good you almost want to see them in something with more brains behind it. For a movie this vulgar, raunchy, immature, inappropriate, and sex-obsessed, I can't think of a score any more fitting of it than a 6.9/10."

And what little gain it is. So much of this feels so clearly ad-libbed that it's basically a parody of an Apatow movie - call it Raunch Movie.

Robert De-Niro makes another career-ruining decision, but Zac Efron is really good at these R-rated comedies (even if there crappy like Awkward Moment and this one), but it's outrageously funny with DeNiro's insolent one-liners, Efron attempts the straight man in a comedy,  we have ourselves a strange outrageously funny comedy. Zac Efron plays Jason, he's a lawyer who ditched his dreams of photography, to take a job at his father's (Dermot Mulroney) law firm, who's about to marry his **** shrew fiance (Julianne  Hough). Robert DeNiro plays Grandpa ****, after his wife's funeral Jason agrees to take **** to his home in Florida. They pare up in Daytona Beach, all Grandpa **** wants to do is have sex with women, because his dying wife's wish was he can get back out there again. Jason bumps into Shadia (Zoey Deutch) who's a photographer who used to be Jason's former photography class partner, **** meets Lenore (played by Audrey Plaza) who's a college student also slut who is obsessed with having sex with ol' grandpa.  And their gay best friend Bradley (Jeffery Bower-Chapman) whom **** seems to make fun of him because of his sexuality, are all heading to Daytona Beach, Florida, for spring break. DeNiro and Efron have good chemistry also DeNiro and Plaza have some funny decent chemistry as well, despite a crappy script by John M. Phillips also a crazy direction by director Dan Mazer, I laughed. 3 out of 5 stars"
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,YorkMan,"Feb 3, 2016",6,"There's a lot of negativity surrounding this film and, while some is well deserved, quite a lot isn't. It's an 'exactly what it says on the tin' movie, so if you've seen the trailer and want to watch, you won't find anything beyond your own expectations.

De Niro plays 'dirty' grandpa next to Efron's preppy lawyer, soon to be married, thumb up his own arse, grandson. At the after funeral party of his wife, De Niro insists that Efron drive him down to Florida for what would be his Grandpa's annual trip there.
Cue sex gags, lots of women in bikinis, drug taking, beer chugging and more uses of the 'F' word by De Niro since Goodfellas (and probably a whole lot more actually).

The storyline itself isn't the main draw, it's the undeniable on-screen chemistry between De Niro and Efron, they look like they're both having fun playing against type, and it's De Niro's best comedy performance since Midnight Run.
Action/comedy are the watchwords, but there are some genuinely amusing 'out of the blue' moments that I wasn't expecting.
However, the rest of the film isn't brilliant. There are various stereotypical lesser characters: Efron's uptight, bossy fiance... The weird older brother... Indian(?) shop owner who sells narcotics... Bumbling muscly dudes from the Lacrosse team... Hot college girl who wants the 'sex trifecta' and actively goes after DeNiro....
Even the romance between Efron and his high school sweetheart is overly forced, as we all know exactly how it will end, even if the ride getting there is a fairly fun one....

Overall, it's not the abject disaster which everyone claims it to be. It's no 'Midnight Run' in terms of a De Niro comedy, but it's no 'Meet the ****' either (I so hate that film!!!)... It nicely sits in the middle, offering a decent slice of laughter, served with a sizeable portion of unoriginality."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,TVJerry,"Jan 29, 2016",4,"Robert De Niro has slummed before, but this is the nadir of his career. He takes his rigid grandson (Zac Efron) on a trip full of substance abuse, sexual encounters and other hopefully-shocking stuff. The script tries desperately to be raunchy and outrageous, but most of it’s not funny. De Niro cusses shamelessly and acts offensively, while Efron lacks any comic fun in his straight-laced reactions (although he flashes his buffness several times). The plot (learning to relax and follow his true self) follows the most trite path ever. To its credit, some of the supporting characters are fun and the pace never lags, but the movie’s effort to be excessive is just embarrassing. If you must see an octogenarian out of control, see Johnny Knoxville as BAD GRANDPA. It’s genuinely hilarious and even a little sweet."

The film is raunchy as it gets. Robert De Niro is so funny as the most wild grandpa that anyone could ever have and he has surprisingly great chemistry with Zac Efron. Robert De Niro has been known to dip into comedy here and there but this is certainly as ""dirty"" as he has gotten and I would say that it is the funniest film I have seen him in a long time. Efron is also really good in this movie. I think that he's one of the more underrated actors in Hollywood right now. Sadly outside of the humor that I thought was fairly plentiful this movie does not have a whole lot more to offer. There are a few members of the supporting cast that are fairly good Aubrey Plaza could be as funny as I've ever seen her which is saying something. Zoey Deutch was great and I'm sure that her ""girl next door"" personality will get her roles in some more films soon. Dirty Grandpa is pretty predictable in the third act which brags it down and there are a few characters that take up a little too much of the screen time rather than focus on the character that we like.

I think the greatest part of this movie was it's entire carpe diem motive, the fact that our protagonist has been conditioned for stationary demeaning work renders him as a blunt pencil, De Niro breathes some wanted life into him, and in himself (and possibly into Aubrey Plaza, but not in the metaphorical sense). However, a long string of jokes that deliver some truly funny hits, doesn't make up for the rushed exposition, probably one of the most rushed expositions I've ever seen from the movie. And when the jokes don't land, it's embarrassing for everyone, a ripple of awkwardness just hit's your soul, it's very unpleasant. Combine that with some unmoving and cliché story progressives and Dirty Grandpa is quite a disappointment.

The actors's performances, despite being all very renown actors was not as great as expected, in fact the emotions and jokes where pretty dull as well.

I would say a lousy writing and script is what leads to these great actors not performing  well. The was there but sadly it was a disaster as it was to serious in that aspect and sarcastic and hard to get sometimes. The sounds where great but the complete lack of music in certain scenes did not help the movie overall.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/just-getting-started/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,TheQuietGamer,"Jun 1, 2018",5,"A Christmas comedy for those of retirement age. As odd as it's holiday setting is, it does a decent job of showing those who are entering the final chapter of their lives having some fun. The plot centers around the rivalry between Morgan Freeman and Tommy Lee Jones and the former's mysterious past that eventually leads to them becoming friends. The humor is rather uneven and the pacing is quite slow. The whole thing is really just a series of competitions between the two leads broken up by awkward bits of unsuccessful flirting with Rene Russo's character before the more action-oriented (and absurd) final act.


The duo's battle for popularity and female attention is largely carried by Freeman. It's nice to see the actor being able to cut loose like this. Even in other movies like Last Vegas where the main idea is to watch everyone cut up, Freeman has always played one of the more restrained and mature characters onscreen. Here he's just a total playboy. Jones is decent as the straight man. His over-serious nature and constant grim stare make his one-liners more amusing than they otherwise would have been. A shame these two great and respectable leads weren't given better material.


For those just entering or already partaking in their later years, Just Getting Started will likely prove to be a good time. It's a middle-of-the-road comedy that wants to show that getting old doesn't necessarily mean that the good times are at an end. As the movie says, ""Happiness is not a condition. It's a choice."" Still, the choice might be somewhat out of people's hands when it comes to watching this one. Particularly in the case of more youthful viewers. The material is quite weak and no amount of pandering to a specific audience can cover it up. Plus there's how it comes off as more of a TV movie than something that made it's way into theaters. Overall, there is an audience for this film. Unfortunately I can't count myself among them, but maybe those who have gotten on up in the years can."

First, the various stories seem unrelated with only minor interactions. The transitions are abrupt, ending one story and then moving onto the next. While the plot ties them all together in the end, waiting for it takes some effort.

Second, all of the stories are centered around tragedy and I just stopped caring at some point.

Third, with the amount of time spent on the ""unreliable narrator"" device in the beginning, I expected (or even hoped for) it to play a significant role in the movie, but it doesn't. Sure, there is a little twist in the end that ties it all together, but it is ineffective and unimportant.

I think the film gets better with time. The film seems to be saying without love, there is nothing, though if one persists in their life, they will find everlasting love; Life Itself makes love the ever connecting fabric between the dead and the living.

I always like to remember as a part of the audience I am agreeing to view the content as-is in comparison to its full potential (which helps fulfill my critiquing) and if I want to view different forms of content then I should create or seek them. The film as-is is decent though leaves me as an audience member with the assignment of listening to Bob Dylan's return project to potentially fully grasp the essence of the film (if Bob Dylan really contributes to it as much as the film makes it seem). Life Itself is not meant to be a serious film (you have to experience the narrating for yourself) though deals with serious situations. 

The film shows that dialogue really affects actors and must be written well for effective scenes in film.

Cinematically, the plot was cliched and offensive and the production aspects were boring, but the film had an excuse. This film was technically directed by David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle) in 2008, but he dropped his involvement in the film and much of it was reshot without him. This film made me laugh in many parts, however, and that is what this film is meant to be, a comedy. So do not watch this if you are looking for high-quality work like Russell's other films, but this is a lot of fun to watch."

I'm really sad watching it. Two of my favorite actors, Bruce Willis and Frank Grillo, are ruining their careers in both movies they played together. It's hard to understand why this duo has dropped to TV movie quality.

A bank is robbed. Bank manager Grillo. His neighbor is retired cop Willis. He is trying to find the man in these. That's the point. It's just comedy that American cops always stay on target and fall like a pear. No one can catch the man in the heart of the city.

There is no sex in the movie."

It was in the pre-production for over a decade, before reshuffle and recasting happened with the existing one. It was supposed to be an Indo-Aussie joint production, but later the Belgium production company joined the project. After the several hurdles it managed to get completed. It was an Anglo-Indian historical romance-drama, during the British raj in India about betrayal, coup, revenge and a journey movie. Also simultaneously set in the modern world focusing an archaeological couple who discovers a lost ancient Indian jewel in a shipwreck. From there the story gets a perfect beginning, later moves back to India.

I don't understand what's with the Chinese music where the actual story take place in the 18th century India. It was so good and blends well, but that does define India or Indian culture while narrating its story. If you are not familiar with both Chinese and Indian musics, then it's not an issue at all. But that does not it, the names are Hindu and Indian soldiers with the Persian costumes, swords and other gadgets.

How the name 'Dragon's Throat' came to Indian geographical area and surname for the Indian characters in a wrong princely state. Like that, many stuffs make no sense, especially if you are from that part of the Earth. I think the research was very poor for making this movie. They should have hired an Indian musician and costume designer with an historian.

""Love has many faces,
and one of them is jealousy.""

The quality was top notch, the cast and their performances were excellent. But I could not stand for Bipasha Basu's facial expressions. She was always been in a sad face look, so depressing. That is the way her character was developed, so nothing wrong in her display. It was her international debut flick as well, and the launch was so disappointing. Because the story was very weak, maybe very silly. I have never seen the narration set in the ancient India other than in the Indian films. Quite amazing locations, and convinced with the visuals that how the 1700s' subcontinent would have looked like.

The major problem with this flick is that people can't get ending. How the time barrier was broken to pass through another timeline was never explained. The Hindu priest/saint/sadhu who blabbers about the space and time was a ridiculous than intellectual briefing. So this film owes lots of explanation to the viewers than entertaining them. I want to favour it, but I also want to be honest. The film was not like I was hoping for, very excited for the merge of historical subject with sci-fi, but did not stand tall. Thankfully, either it was not a bad movie of the year, I've seen even worse that I felt not to review. I won't recommend it, but there's a slim chance that you might like it, so choose it carefully.

This is why you're seeing reviews run hot and cold. The basic premise is a good, scifi-mind-transference one, but a short 100-min film demands unacceptable compromises. This needs A LOT of run room to properly play out, so it needed to be an 8 to 13 episode streaming series. Shoehorning this story into 100-mins results in ridiculous timelines and implausibilities. And Keanu's infamous wooden acting doesn't help to sell this either. Thank god for Middleditch's character that attempted to call into question so much of the ridiculosity going on. (Can't wait for the next season of him in Silicon Valley.) So look, you can be forgiven for hating this film, I struggled to get through it, but I wanted to understand the underlying story despite its hurried execution."

The original idea of the story might hold some interesting possibilities but with the glaring holes, it's just not there yet. Semi-watchable, never at any point really good or believable. Exciting for a while. A 3 is too harsh, semi-watchable after all but the holes in the story really stop this from being any good."

And I gotta say, while it wasn't terrible like I feared it would be, it's definitely the half-baked and uninspired sci-fi romp that the critics told us it was. With iffy effects, mediocre acting from all involved (including Keanu Reeves unfortunately), unintentionally humorous scenes, and countless sci-fi tropes and cliches thrown into one jumbled mess of a film, it's definitely easily forgettable and disposable. Overall, there are only a small handful of interesting moments, but obviously nowhere near enough to make up for the rest of the film."

Almost everything takes shortcuts. The science, the absence of 4 persons for 17 days, the police, the bad guys. The acting is pretty ordinary. The best performances comes from the youngest actors. The plot's big revelation comes totally flat. I give it 48%. The kind of film you will forget tomorrow. That's why I am writing this review...before I forget about it."

I really wonder how this was made for a whopping 30m budget and turned out so laughably mediocre especially with Keanu Reeves involved. It truly plays out like a VOD type 3m budget film with some awful acting, messy plotting, dull dialogue, and worst of all abhorrent mid 90s like CGI. While the intro abruptly intrigues somewhat with an ambitious enough sequence of events, it unravels into ridiculous yet watchable territory quickly. Most of the film drags on until an insane conclusion which at least swings for the fence with some exciting moments albeit nonsensical. Overall it's a very forgettable film that doesn't deliver much ultimately, that happens to have Keanu in it. If you're a fan of Keanu, it's worth watching but don't expect much."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/replicas-2018/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Davrosdaleks1,"Jan 12, 2019",5,"In Replicas, Keanu Reeves is a scientist working for a company in a South American country focusing on cloning and trying to preserve the human mind on a computer. This turns out to be super convenient as the scientist loses his wife and kids in a car crash. Grief-stricken, he clones their bodies and transfers their consciousnesses (as one does). What results is a surprisingly amateurish effort considering the lead.

The dialogue is pretty weak. People do things that don't feel natural. Weirdly enough, the movie explains certain things pretty thoroughly and interestingly, such as the whole lazarus/rebirth process, while other plot points are just revealed abruptly and sloppily.

The acting doesn't help things either. Keanu is on autopilot here. The guy who plays his boss is hit-and-miss. But it's Alice Eve (She's Out of my League; Star Trek into Darkness) who has the worst performance. She acts like an animatronic. (And yes this is even before the cloning. It isn't a something-went-wrong-type situation.) She has two facial expressions: slightly happy and slightly worried. On the plus side, Silicon Valley's Ben Middleditch is the only one who manages to make all the dialogue work. My hat off to him.

It's sad that this movie was botched so badly because the actual general story could have worked. The concepts they explore here are fun and fascinating. A lot of thought did go into how they brought the family back.

To it's credit, the film does look really good. It has excellent color use and picturesque filming locations.

Overall, this is a bad film, but I wouldn't say it was downright painful. I didn't leave regretting having watched it. If you like making fun of bad movies, then you might want to check this out. Otherwise, I can't recommend this."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/polar/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,calderra,"Aug 4, 2020",6,"From the very first scene, it's clear the script writer doesn't speak native English. The low-rent camerawork and costuming don't help. A lot of scenes looks like a bunch of Eurotrash rejects from The Matrix stepped into a student film. At one point the evil villain goes over his master plan. He literally just explains how retirement plans work, and then the Matrix rejects say ""please explain"". I think most 18-year-olds with a decent job can already follow the plot kid, but the director really thinks he sounds like a genius. It's like in a low-rent horror movie when a ""scientist"" tries to sound smart by reading a page from a gradeschool science book.

Director Jonas Akerlund is famous for his music videos which I've personally never thought were very well-made. They're usually just very weird, which works for music. But they weren't very technically well-shot. In a film, all his flaws are amplified.

It's sad because Mads Mikkelsen is amazing. Fans of his later performance in Hannibal already know how amazing Mads is as the sort of quiet intimidation that makes for a perfect assassin. He really acts the pants off his role, even while the Eurotrash around him stumble over lines and bad makeup and worse accents.

People will say ""just turn off your brain"". An enjoyable movie shouldn't have to involve absolutely insulting drivel. Here's a quick example. The bad guy needs exactly $29 million or whatever. So he decides to enact a giant plan to steal - wait for it - exactly $29 million. Except to do this, he's going to have to hire an absurd number of top-notch hitmen from around the world. That's going to cost, what, $29 million? So this job - at best - is going to break even? Come on. It isn't hard to write yourself out of this hole either - just make the payoff something absurd like a billion dollars. Why not?

Sigh. So this is a really stupid movie with annoying direction. Only watch it if you want to see Mads Mikkelsen kick some ass, and don't be afraid to fast forward the dumb Eurotrash nonsense between the action scenes. You won't miss anything."

So we end up with a stale version of this which seems to have all the same ingredients but feels undercooked. It's a shame I feel like if the pacing had been tweaked and maybe a less flamboyant lead villan chosen the film could've hit closer to its target.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/polar/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,ViniciusBrito,"Feb 6, 2019",6,"A institution of professional killers have a policy of retirement at age 50. When the employee retires, they recieve millions of dollars, and for the company to keep their money and pay their bills they kill every single one that reaches 50 years old, The Black Kaizer is one of them and he will have to fight and shoot to survive. Directed by Jonas Âkerlund and written by Jayson Rothwell.
This film is a lot of fun, honestly, it doesn't delivery anything new at all, it is a very known kind of movie that doesn't change anything, but not every film needs to do that, right? The story in here is beyond simple, it is there just to justify the next actions, it is a concept better than anything, a nice and interesting one, not necessary makes sense, but if you don't think much about it, the notion will pull the rope into a fine place. The story is before anything else based on missions, during the film you see some missions that the hitman, Black Kaizer, did in his life and when he gonna reach 50 years old, his company will do anything to kill him, so after his last mission, we see him going under covered and a team trying to find him and kill him. While all of that the montage give us some flashes of something that at first it doesn't make any sense, you not sure if that is a flash foward or a flash back, they keep showing that all the time, you can realise that it is something that torments the character but not until the very end it does make sense, it give us a interesting plot twist, heavy and you can feel some tension, but the way how it was build up was ok, nothing very spetacular, but it is, again, a good twist. The narrative goes mostly in two ways, while showing the main character and stuff around him, it is more dark and raw, but when it changes to the team, it gets full cartoonized, with animation kill and crazy stuff, i like the idea, but how it was made i'm not so sure, there are some moments where they change to one and to another and the scenes in each one are so brief that feels wrong, all the time after some point it goes to crazy to dark, and when they do it, it should feel natural in both, but sometimes it does bother, but not all the time. This is that kind of film with hard sex, giant full of blood violence and drugs all the time, for those that enjoy this is for sure a full plate of fun. One problem with this film is the villain, the company boss, that kind of villain that is fat, have zero athleticism, is arrogant and thinks he is own control all the time, typical **** villain for this kind of film, i couldn't dislike this kind of character more, it is so boring and weak, i believe that they choose this kind of guy to be the villain because he is the completely opposite from what our main guy is, but it is so ridiculous, the character is in a top place in his work, and in every one of his scenes with Katheryn's character i was like, ""how is this dumb guy is still on top with she around?"" because he is so weak that i can't imagine how she would still be there, Katheryn's character would have knocked him out long time ago.
Mads Mikkelsen is really fun to watch, you can totally see that he put his time into his works and incorporate the character pretty fine and you believe in him, you can get angusty in his eyes, along with tranquility, wich makes sense, because he is already doing that for so long, even with all of that, it is possible to feel and see a traumatization by some of his old actions, it is a good interpretation of a not very original character. Katheryn Winnick doesn't have much to do in here, she kinda have some screen time, but what she gotta do is repetitive, in a lot of moments it seems that she is doing the same thing as her last scene, but still, she was ok, she didn't had much material to work with.
The action in this film is really good, it is brutal and combined with Mads acting just get better with time. We got a lot of gore scenes with penetrations and blood all the time. There are creativity in some moments and lack of it in others. There are a lot of moments where you can see that someone could have shot in him easily, but come on, right? There are a lot of badass moments for the character, there is one specifically in a cabin that it is really well done, combining the action with the speaking aspect and not being sure of where is who, it is relly raw and fun, there is one or another moment that doesn't made sense, but it was pretty good.
Polar is a very fun film, with hardcore sex, brutal and raw violence, and a concept that makes the story keep going, it isn't much original or different from other movies that are like this one, but it is definely a must watch for those who enjoy those aspects that i mention."

However, I'm often left perplexed by Fred Durst's lyrics. Sometimes there's a clear message there and others all I can gather is that it's just a bunch word vomit where confusion seems to be the only rational reaction. You can probably guess which type The Fanatic more closely resembles...

In this clash between action movie star and obsessed fan it's never clear who you're supposed to be rooting for. ""Moose"" is a clearly autistic man who just doesn't know any better, but that doesn't make him any less dangerous. ""Hunter Dunbar"" is world-class jerk who definitely could handled the situation better, but it's hard to fault him for getting aggressive when faced with a stalker that crossed the line. Perhaps we're not supposed to sympathize with either of them in the end. Which would have been acceptable had there been some kind of meaning to all of this, but alas there doesn't appear to be any. So that violent conclusion just ends up leaving a bad taste in your mouth.

It's not even like The Fanatic really does all that much wrong. The humor it tries to mine from Moose's childlike behavior feels out of place and may not sit well with some as it comes at the expense of the mentally ill, but I wouldn't straight garbage or anything like that. It's just that without anything to say for itself the film's most notable qualities end up being John Travolta's all in, yet strangely terrible performance and the fact that it's entirely the brainchild of Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst. Both of which are certainly interesting, but not enough to make the movie worth watching given the considerable lack of substance.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-ridiculous-6/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,IAmTech,"Jun 18, 2016",5,"Yes that's right, I've seen the fabled one time controversial Adam Sandler movie, all the way through! who wants to touch me? (yes I also realise I just totally dated my own review with this dated gag reference, had to be done). So **** a dumb western filled with blatant stereotypes, corny routines, obvious gags and it treats women as nothing more than sexual objects, but in all honesty what did you expect? Firstly its an Adam Sandler movie, and secondly, it has 'ridiculous' in the bloody title! its literately saying to you, this movie is gonna be daft as ****, you have been warned. So why all the fuss I don't know.

Plot wise its your typical western fare about revenge ****, more revenge. Tommy Stockburn (Sandler) has been raised by native Americans (or red Indians to be politically incorrect) because way back as a child his mother was shot dead by a mysterious stranger. His father Frank (Nick Nolte) was an infamous bank robber and just happens to come by Tommy's village to tell him he's his father because plot convenience. Frank speaks of 50K he's buried away and intends to share with Tommy, but before you can say rootin-tootin outlaws, some outlaws turn up that used to be in a gang with Frank and claim the money. Frank lies about the moneys whereabouts as the gang take him hostage to go find it, this gives Tommy time to find the loot in its real location. Alas Tommy is unable to find the loot so he must come up with another way to raise 50K to pay the outlaws and save his dad. The clock is ticking before the outlaws realise that Frank was lying about the moneys location.

Now the main lure here must be the stereotypical ridiculous six characters that are all hilariously related to each other, no really its **** its not. Sandler is obviously the leader of the gang, the low gravely Eastwood voiced, ice cool loner, raised by native Americans and is super hot with knives. Terry Crews is Chico, a black piano player who hasn't ever admitted to anyone he's actually, possibly, slightly black, and of course despite the fact he's ****'s actually a real softie. Jorge Garcia plays Herm, a role that probably would have gone to John Belushi or John Candy if they were alive. A big fat slobby, dirty, feral type bloke who can't speak English but everyone understands him anyway. Taylor Lautner embarrasses himself immensely here as the gangs redneck simpleton complete with braces and buckteeth. Luke Wilson plays the dandy type, good looking, athletic, well dressed, but a miserable failure with his last occupation as a bodyguard for Abe Lincoln. Lastly good old Rob Schneider plays the greasy dirty Mexican Ramon who owns a donkey with super powered diarrhea. So there you have a complete array of stereotypes, the white man raised by Indians, the token black guy, the fat slob, the doofus, the dandy and the dirty Mexican. Oh and Nolte, can't understand a bloody word he's saying, not one.

Now whilst many might be expecting the biggest load of horse **** this side of the Rio Grande, in all fairness, its not that **** places. The gang sets out to pinch 50K from various people and places that they consider to be bad or immoral, so they don't feel bad about stealing basically. As you might expect what you get is pretty predictable stuff with some pretty daft action. They rob a bank utilising Ramon's diarrhea filled donkey as a diversion, yes this means the donkey **** all over someone. They steal a huge gold nugget from a casino owned by Smiley Harris (Harvey Keitel), this involved much silly hijinks from the whole gang such as Chico and his piano playing and Tommy with his knife skills. They also steal a huge sum of cash from Ezekiel Grant (Jon Lovitz), Mark Twain (Vanilla Ice) and General Custer (David Spade) in a poker game which involves the whole gang. Yes I did just mention Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain, yes it was unbelievably insane casting, yes I admit I quite liked it yet I do not know why, yes I am ashamed of myself.

Another rather quirky scene involved John Turturro as Abner Doubleday, the man who apparently came up with the all American national past time of rounde...errr baseball. I don't know the history behind this actual person, nor do I know the rules of baseball inside out, however I do have a basic knowledge of the game, not that that's necessary to enjoy this scene though...I digress. Anywho, this scene is actually quite amusing as Turturro literately makes up the rules of baseball as he goes along, but only because he's trying to not lose at his own creation. It sounds childish but the fact that Doubleday is useless at his own sport creation, whilst everyone else is getting the hang of it, was actually reasonably funny, mainly because of Turturro's performance.

This movie is pretty much like any throwaway silly comedy I've ever seen through my life, it has its moments, it does make you smile at times, and to that **** done its job essentially (much like the gloriously stu"

They tend to be unpleasant and have an obsession with being locked away both physically and emotionally from the outside world. This movie is probably the one I’ve liked the least on first viewing. I didn’t feel like any character was particularly clever and no one had any redeeming qualities. In the end I just didn’t care what happened to anyone in the movie.

Plenty of scenes that are fillers and don't particularly go anywhere. I found some parts patronizing/ condescending, trying to show the ""poor girl that faces plenty of difficulties in life"" and ""she is a minority!! look at her, so poor!"" kind of thing. It is like watching the life of a regular person, with ups and downs, and nothing more. The ending is abrupt, showing that there is really no real message, nothing concrete. It is a mash-up of things that can happen to anyone's life but what can be attractive to some is that it is not what many people might have lived in their lives. It is like a person that wants to go to a ""poor country to appreciate life more"" kind of thing. Maybe the ""there is people in worst situations than me, why am I complaining about what I have?"" message is understood as the ""feel-good"" part or ""touching"" and some people have said."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/roma/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Mar 1, 2019",2,"I fail to see why ""Roma"" is getting all the raves and awards it has been getting. In many ways, it reminded me of films from the 1950s and 1960s from European directors, mainly Italian, such as ""Bitter Rice"", ""The Bicycle Thief"", ""Open City"", Michelangelo Antonioni, Robert Rossellini and Victoria De Sica. The main differences are that these films and directors didn't take 2+ hours to tell their stories or linger too long even by a second on a scene whether it be a boy looking out a car window or a dog jumping up against a gate. They brought new cinematography to the screen and more depth to their stories.

Maybe it has been a long time since critics/people have seen such films that reflect life between the classes or maybe ""Downton Abbey"" has given them a false picture of the same. There are little passions or emotions shown by the director/screenwriter Alfonso Cuaron.

The surprising aspect of ""Roma"" is the acting debut of Yalitza Aparicio as a maid who has a warm connection to the children of her employers and though she is a presence throughout the film it only comes alive when it concentrates on her trials and tribulations.

With the exception of maybe 15 minutes, I was bored during most of the 2-hour 18-minute  ""Roma""."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/manchester-by-the-sea/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,FadeBlack,"May 21, 2017",3,"One of my biggest issues of a very dominant trend in both filmmaking and TV shows in the past few years is the overbearing strive and subsequent critical acclaim for material that is heavily realistic, presents ""complex and flawed"" characters, but there is a complete lack of central morality or moral lens for the viewer. If anything about good and evil, right or wrong, morality in general is touched upon, it is strictly restrained to moral relativism, where it's always ""up to the viewer"" to form their own feelings, the filmmaker tries not to offer the slightest clue about his or her stance on the issues. Pretty much every last ""critically acclaimed"" TV show these days falls under this category, and a plethora of movies, Manchester by the Sea being the most recent example of the ones I have seen, though it's really not about one or two examples.

The issue I have with this ""non judgmental"" trend is that I firmly believe art, truly great art, should in some shape or form benefit society, not simply present it ""as is."" When society celebrates stories of moral relativism, it adopts moral relativism. Things that were, and for good reason, seen as clearly wrong, suddenly become ""complex,"" up for personal interpretation, depending on ""circumstance."" And if challenged, the excuse is always ""oh I'm not endorsing this, I'm just portraying real life without judging. This is what people do.""

But when art abandons teaching moral messages, that contributes to society becoming morally anchorless and losing its scope of what's right or wrong. No, this definitely is not an argument about ""violent movies influence violence in real life"" or anything of the sort - it's not about what is portrayed, but how it is portrayed. And morality seems to have been sacrificed by many filmmakers on the altar of realism, with both public and critical acclaim embracing this with both arms."

I see that many have expressed dislike of the film but have nonetheless praised Affleck's acting.  Can't agree.  I myself don't think the film is Oscar-worthy.  Frankly, it bored me.  Affleck's acting struck me as one-dimensional; he seemed removed.  And the fact that he didn't have an accent was a complete turn-off.  After all, Casey's a Massachusetts native & his character was raised in Manchester.  The fact that his character lacked a regional accent seriously detracted form this film's realism.  (In a very funny recent SNL skit he played a Dunkin' Donuts fanatic from Boston & his accent was Just So.)

My concern has grown since going to watch it. I'm glad the masses found it enjoyable. I, unfortunately, find myself to be one of few (at least vocal) cinemagoers who did not like the film. Leaving the cinema, I was offended. I felt gypped, cheated, mislead, though, happy to see the back of it. To evoke the saying ""throw me a bone"", this movie showed me its bones, one by one, placed them clumsily into its various pockets and tripped into the sea. I waited for this movie to give me anything, something I could leave with, something to shock me, something I haven't seen before. It gave me the latter, perhaps the most tedious, plodding, most unenjoyable cinema experience in recent memory.  I found myself counting the seconds between each line of dialogue delivered. It was comical. I was grasping for threads to follow, themes of substance, anything, I was starving. Maybe that was the point, a realist approach, showing it as it were, I had surmised. I tossed and turned in this manner until I had no longer cared as to construe purpose in the film. Resorting to taking in the pretty pictures, I landed at the conclusion that this was what the film was, and just that. Just as I relaxed uncomfortably, a thought of Barry Lyndon came to my head. Perhaps this film excels at nothing.

As I do with any art related enterprise, I give props to the filmmakers for making art, participating in the craft, and for throwing in their two cents. Offended as I was by the lack of substance within the picture, they provided me with something to get passionate about, even if that may be the distaste for the picture itself. I see this picture called ""The perfect film"", to that I must conclude this is your first time, there's much more in store for you."

There is a fixation on a white stick inside the English planes on the left hand side which gets multiple close in shots but it's never made clear what this stick does or why it is given so much prominence. In general I was somewhat mystified by how few of anything, except English soldiers, were shown in the film. There was no sense of urgency in the film, I would imagine that under the circumstances there would have been a great deal of urgency if not near panic or outright panic.

Beyond me how clap trap like this rates so high on rotten tomatoes."

No german soldiers to be seen just an invisible enemy apart from some CGI warplanes. Dunkirk didn't try to depict the true horrors of war. Totally the opposite of Saving private Ryan, Hacksaw ridge etc.
Christopher Nolan wanted a suspense film, and not a war film as such, and yet this is a failure too, as I had no empathy with any of the characters weather they lived or died. Hans Zimmer is a great music composer, however the music  was supposed to add some intensity and suspense to the film and yet I just found it annoying as it was constant throughout. The only shock and horror  I found regarding this film are the positive reviews. This film is  for snowflakes and people who suffer from a very nervous disposition."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/45-years/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Jan 29, 2016",1,"Where do I start? There is nothing wrong with Charlotte Rampling's performance but certainly not worth an Oscar nomination over either Lily Tomlin in ""Grandma"" or Charlize Theron in ""Mad Max"" just to name possible other candidates. Do I say that the film is 'much ado about nothing' and would have been served better being a one hour TV movie on Lifetime or Netflex?

""45 Years"" seems just that long in spite of the running time being only 95 minutes but it is padded with many scenes of Rampling, sometimes with a dog, sometimes not, walking on the admitted beautiful shots of Norfolk landscapes where the story takes place or one extended scene of her playing the piano.

The conflict, that took place before they met, seemingly upends all that they have had is really a flimsy reason for what takes place. She was a teacher, he a factory manager and they have had a 45 year loving, comfortable, childless marriage with both being retired now, she still very active and he slowing down to illness.Without giving anything away it seems very far fetched that things always available are now seen and read for the first time.

Watching the performances of Charlotte Rampling and Tim Courtenay, who have been stars for over 50 years, are always a joy to watch and even though their silences can say a lot here they really aren't given substantial material to work with.  There is a scene between the two having sex that is very funny and could be real to life but it isn't enough.

""45 Years"" is one of the very few films that I would recommend seeing on the small screen instead of a theatre screen."

And finally, the conflict between the two characters was left completely unresolved.  I guess that's artsy, but if you ask me, it's lazy storytelling, the issues were not explored so it's not surprising they were not resolved.  Was the acting fantastic?

It has no social importance or, more seriously, redemption. It is a movie about white men killing white men. There are no women, no blacks, no other ethnicities but Italians (even the “Irishman” is played by an Italian). Movies like this have littered the film landscape for 38 years since 1972’s The Godfather (which did the same thing but so much better, mainly because the genre was new). On a broader brush I say: Scorsese and Tarantino and the ilk should no longer have the power to make their pointless glorification of murder stories. It is long past time to let new voices with new visions into the boys club of directing and producing movies. I am a movie lover fed up with decades of stories about murderers. Make it stop.

I have been a Pixar fan for years, even since my dad bought me Toy Story on VHS and me, him and my step-mother watched it in the living room on our projector. They had a good cast (minus Lewis Black. That guy just grates me), just to me it falls apart at it's story line and it's execution.

Where it falls apart for me is the characters and the lack of development they have. You just don't feel anything towards them, so you don't care for or feel any of the emotions that they are feeling. This disappointed me as with their previous film ""Up"", and they managed feel every range of emotion possible in the space of the first 10 minutes.

The other big problem I had with Inside Out was that the world that populate the feature with-in Riley's ""psyche"" were boring, bland, lifeless and unimaginative. When the 2 main characters are having navigate themselves through them, they just leave nothing memorable. To me, the worlds are literally dead and lifeless.

I have 2 positives, though they do not compare the 2 negatives I have already listed. The animation (unsurprisingly) is stunning and is the exact level you expect a Pixar animation to be at. Now to the most enjoyable part of the film in my opinion. The story revolves around the emotions residing inside of Riley's head and essentially revolves around her. The most enjoyable part of the film for me was where we showed the emotions inside the mother and fathers heads, and also during the credits scene you see inside quite a few other characters heads. It is pretty funny as well as very inventive. Shame that it is barely 5 minutes of the entire film.

I can see kids enjoying the film, but being a long standing Pixar film fan, I did not enjoy it in the slightest. I hope they do better on their next project."

Mom and Dad characters are completely one dimensional. Even the girl looks like robot controlled by stupid crew. And why did they put in this popular psychology theory that loves to put labels on people but always no more than 4 please. I better to see how the emotions behave in different life situations than to follow how american sale manager ""Joy"" learns the hard way that analytic ""Sorrow"" also a person and could be useful sometimes."

Funny? Yes! Charming, oh yes! Too long? Indeed! Despite mixing an outdated psychology of emotions with contemporary concepts of mind, the biggest fault of Inside Out is overestimating its story as worth a full-length feature film. Half of the film is a round-around journey of the two main characters trying to return (without success) to their headquarters.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/marriage-story/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,StephenCrome,"Dec 9, 2019",0,"Last night I watched the first twenty minutes of Marriage Story. I love everyone involved in the movie so expectations were very high. But immediately, (IMMEDIATELY) the intrusive, BUSY musical score started to drive a nail into my head. Here were two monologues; letters written by the lead characters about each other. They were smart (if a little precious) and heartfelt and full of nice details. However, the entire time Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were speaking, this wall to wall orchestra kept sawing away, frolicking and gamboling like a Rossini overture underlining the moments with 'whimsy' and the promise of 'heartache.' Like a bright yellow highlight pen, the music left no room for independent thought: I was being told exactly how to feel about every second. But I got through the opening bits; although I didn't quite buy any of the director/actor theatre scenes- Why is that no one ever seems to be able to capture the truth of what it's like to do small theatre? Those ridiculous rehearsal scenes were painful in their ostentatious **** don't get me started on the actual performance of the play. It was almost exactly like that old SNL sketch ""Bad Conceptual Theatre"" - If only Dan Aykroyd had stepped out as Leonard Pinth Garnell to give a review - Even more hilarious was the discovery in a later scene that this awful slice of ""high art"" was slated for Broadway. In what universe? But I stuck with it until the scene where Scarlett Johansson reminds her husband that she finds it difficult to cry onstage only to walk into her bedroom and burst into tears. This is a moment that should've wrecked me. It's beautifully set up, and would have been totally unexpected and rending. But at she walks through the hallway towards her bedroom, the score whips up into a Soap Opera ready string-filled cry of anguish so generic it could have been used for that old Carol Burnett sketch As The Stomach Turns. The camera pulls in to show Scarlett's tear-filled face - but any empathy is immediately **** to the ground by the hideously OVER THE TOP music.

Cut to: this morning as I scanned through the Golden Globe Nominations. Not only is that exercise in bathos and banality actually nominated for Best Original Score... It was written by none other than Randy Newman. Bummer.

If I make it through the movie it will be with the sound off and the subtitles on. I like to decide how I feel about things. I don't need to be smothered in kisses to know I am loved. And I don't need to be swaddled in a treacly, syrupy, honey-laden, jokey, telegraphing soundscape in order to understand that sadness or joy are on display. I'm pretty sure I'm smarter than that. My CATS are definitely smarter than that. It's no coincidence that Bennett coughed up three yards of hairball during the first thirty seconds of the movie."

The movie essentially sides with the wife as they add the unforgivable bombshell that he has cheated on her. It also never lets him respond to the allegations that he is a smothering, self-involved idiot. She is portrayed as completely justified in blowing up the marriage and dude has to **** on the pain.

1. The obnoxious and distracting camera work. They try and look clever with all these contentious shots. The issue is that ruins the pacing of each scene since it leaves no room for properly edited cuts.

2. The music, the singing and sound mixing are all atrocious. ""Another Day of Sun"" is possibly one of the single worst opening numbers I've witnessed. And I say witnessed, not heard, because you can't hear a damn thing. The music sounds like what you'd hear in an elevator. Competent but boring. The singing is the same, but none of the few decent singers this movie has can harmonise properly. It's hard to notice that problem though, when you can't hear them over the damn music. 3. Yeah... The ""white guy trying to save Jazz"" is problematic as hell. It's like how in RENT all the white people are being gentrified out of their neighbourhood by a black guy... Like, are you freaking kidding me? It doesn't bother me that much, but it's an issue.

Look, if you like this. Hey, that's great and.. No, I can't do this. Like, if you enjoyed this, I genuinely feel sorry you haven't been exposed to better musicals. I mean go look up Hairspray's opening on youtube. That's a song about Baltimore, yet it sounds more inviting than LA. Or go watch ""Singing in the Rain"". Sit down and listen to some of the musical numbers from Wicked or Hamilton or The Book of Mormon. Hell, if you're rich enough go see them while you still can.

There is a world of far, far, faaaaaaaar superior musicals out there for you to enjoy. La La Land is an insult to them all."

I literally already forgot about this movie, and watched it not long ago.

The only interesting character is the mother.  The main character isn't very appealing and at times is a real jerk.  The whole production seems amateurish.  And the entire storyline gets dull real fast.  It's only about 90 minutes long but seems longer because it is rather boring.  I think the director was saddled with a not-so-good script that ends very abruptly.  Basically, this was a coming-of-age drama that should have been so much better.

Well, how about for the first time ever, metacritic has let me down. Can I ask them for a refund? Lol! For those of you who are interested in my opinion, I just found the movie boring. It's basically snapshots **** life and they just weren't that interesting or compelling. I found myself checking the time, shifting in my seat, eating too much popcorn to try and stave off the boredom. It just wasn't for me.

Christine (oh squeeze me, ""Lady Bird""), was everything her mother said she was. Selfish, ungrateful, argumentative and a bit of a user. As the lead character, she wasn't a very nice person. Her mother was mean, a bully, controlling and miserable. Welcome to the 2 lead characters! On the plus side, the supporting characters were mostly delightful! Christine's best friend Jules was so lovely, I want her for my best friend. The father was just a gorgeous, supportive person and even her belligerent brother and his strange girlfriend were more interesting and more open to criticism than ""Lady Bird"" herself. If this is autobiographical in any way, I don't think Greta Gerwig was a very nice teenager! (That's right, I said it, come at me!!!)  In short, I found the movie stale. Nothing new or interesting here. How the hell it got a 94 is still beyond me. That's a bloody high score!!! At least the user score has it lower down the totem pole, with Phantom Thread, The Greatest Showman and Paddington 2 rating higher. I think I'll have to pay more attention to the userscore and less to the metascore in the future. Maybe, if it had a score of 60/70, I wouldn't be so scathing but I feel royally ripped off and I'm never gonna get those 90 mins back.

Full of empty, shallow dialogues, useless scenes, subplots that are immediately abandoned (it reminded me of The Room), and a lot of boring, stupid characters that are completely unlikable (except for the father). The screenplay and edit are TERRIBLE.

These kinds of movies are, in my view, actually  produced for critics, perhaps to win one of those esoteric Cannes-type festival awards, irrespective of commercial success.  This movie was 165 minutes L  O  N  G and could have been half as long. The final scene was so very typical, dwelling on Ines still and emotionless face for what seemed like a minute. There were several shots like that.  And the movie pinballed all over the place and was difficult to follow. It was mostly in Germany, switching sort of seamlessly to French, English and Romanian, making it even more difficult to follow.  We sort of get the message, having worked in corporations and as a consultant. And we've all seen or been part of dysfunctional relationships between adult children and their parents.  Nothing particular was illuminated here. Perhaps the reason I gave this a 2 was Metacritic's professional critics averaged 93, which is ludicrous.

What was the last funny German comedy you saw? What was the last 3 hour funny comedy you saw?

At the Gateway Theatre in Fort Lauderdale they have a section where audience members can post cards with what they thought of the movie they just saw and I put “Awful—even worse than “Neruda”—see my review of Tuesday February 7th.

In a running time of 2 hours and 45 minutes I found a total of 6 to7 minutes that got me to smile and in those 6 to 7 minutes, maybe 2 minutes, which were old fashioned slapstick making it seem like a comedy.

The film is primarily a daughter, Ines, played by Sandra Huller, and father, Winifred alias Toni, played by Peter Simonischek, story. The father is a child who never grew up and the daughter a workaholic always wheeling and dealing, a lot on the phone, and having to put up with the sexism of the work place.

Winifred puts on a wild wig and uses false teeth to bring some fun into his daughter’s life whether it is at the workplace where she seems to play along in order to avoid embarrassment or in what little private life she has. The film takes that 2 hour and 45 minutes to show the results.

There are a couple of full frontal/rear male/female scenes with one really generating a good laugh but if you think watching a guy **** on a petit-four or another one sitting on whoopee cushion is funny than maybe this movie is for you.

“Toni Erdmann” does have a couple of touching scenes but what film dealing with a father and daughter at odds with each other doesn’t?

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-is-true/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,KenR,"Feb 12, 2020",3,"It’s curious that we have a movie about William Shakespeare bearing a name like All Is True when the largest portion of it may well not be. But of course, how could any of this be known when it all took place so very long ago and, so little survives or had been recorded about the famous Bard. Writer Ben Elton has donned both his creative hats for this concoction – that of total fictional fabrication and ‘what we think to know’ presumptions. Director/actor Kenneth Branagh while wanting to accurately transcribe the times may have forgotten that it’s also important to entertain his audience and allow them to enjoy the visual treats of sets, costumes, and creating a mood via creative lighting. His sets are so gloomily lit there’s a tenancy to lull the viewer to sleep. A particularly slow pace could even leave some reaching for the 2 x times remote.  This need not have been - broad subjects such as this, set in dark times, under other great lighting/cameramen have allowed us to be transported back to bygone candle/gaslight days by using deep blacks and well-lit subjects that allowed viewers to feel the era and enjoy the rich moods simultaneously. For an artificial interpretation of reality, a thinking audience will forgive any production that considers their visual appreciation over sombre moods.

Modern liberties seem to have been catered for by suggesting that Will’s Sonnets may have been written for another bloke – in this case, the Earle of Southampton. Not sure where Elton came up with this suggestion as there doesn’t appear all that much documentation to build on that assumption.  We learn that Mr Shakespeare did not attend University, somewhat proving that a University degree can’t always account for intelligence, and that his wife Anne was illiterate. There are other family intrigues to offer personal interest but what promised to be an enlightening experience comes across as a tad too heavy-handed and at times inaccessible.    Performances are good but still remains for dedicated Shakespeare followers only, and some won’t even last the distance – it’s not that it's overlong, just takes it’s time telling its (largely fabricated) story."

It dived away from its original movie The Shining and its unique Hotel experience and they turned it into a superhero movie with such dull characters and a stupid story. The movie was too long and so damn boring, the only part where i enjoyed it was in the last chapter where it finally felt a bit like The Shining and the flashbacks were good as well.

Don't watch this movie thinking it will be anywhere similar to The Shining or to its story it's far from it.

I don't recommend it, it's 2/10 for me, and the only reason why I'm giving it 1 point is only for the last chapter."

Everything from the color correction, the acting, the editing, the laughable CGI, to the set design looked like a cheap television show. The characters were hilariously underwritten and poorly developed. Lets take a look at the main characters of Doctor Sleep. First we have hipster witch **** who was the most cliché and uninspired villain Hollywood has seen in a long while. Her costume design alone was enough to send shivers down my spine. Next we have teenage supergirl who was completely lifeless, poorly acted, and was a constant reminder that this movie was very likely intended for a much younger audience. Then we have a generic alcoholic version of Renton from Trainspotting who really did a great job playing an addict. (Just kidding go watch **** Trainspotting) What really busted my nut was the recurring homages to Kubrick which served as constant reminders of how good The Shining is and how bad this movie is. I laughed out loud when I saw the continued attempts to recreate iconic shots from The Shining as if it would trick the audience into believing the two films were even close to being on the same level. I know it’s most likely not fair to compare this film to one of the greatest horror movies of all time but it’s incredibly difficult not to when you see the repeated attempts to recreate what Kubrick envisioned. How can the audience be expected not to compare these two films when the only moments of genuine cinematic style in Doctor Sleep are blatant recreations of scenes from The Shining. Not one moment of this movie was interesting, thrilling, unique, or necessary."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/doctor-sleep/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,Ferorake,"Dec 3, 2019",3,"Solo una cosa: OH CHE PALLE. Sono andato a vedere questo film per caso, e se avessi saputo che sarebbe stato tedioso in questa maniera, avrei sicuramente optato per la classica commedia di Natale. Badate bene che parlo da NON filmofilo, ma di appassionato di culturafantasy, dunque non disprezzo a priori opere simili. Disprezzo però quando un film è insulso, sconclusionato, e l'unico modo di dargli spessore sia quello di ""usare chiavi di lettura"" che trasformano completamente il film in qualcosa che NON ESISTE. Se avessi voluto leggere un trattato di etica, avrei letto un saggio, non mi sarei visto un film la cui trama è ""dei tizi brutti e cattivi per vivere devono assorbire l'energia di alcuni bambini speciali, a caso nasce un bambino ancora più speciale che riesce a spaccare senza motivo i tizi brutti e cattivi, e viene aiutato in questo da un altro bambino speciale che però è diventato adulto ed è uno sfigato alcolizzato"". Ora, posso anche soprassedere sulla banalità della trama di per sé, perché la maggior parte delle storie fantasy hanno la peculiarità di essere razionalizzabili, ma non posso soprassedere sulla completa mancanza di approfondimenti o spiegazioni sul funzionamentoorigine di questi poteri. Non puoi raccontare una storia dove la magia è elemento PRINCIPALE, senza spiegarne il minimo funzionamento. Tra l'altro manca completamente qualsiasi riferimento o dettaglio sull'origine del cattivo, il ché una cosa insensata che cozza con le basi nella stesura di un qualsiasi racconto fantasy. Io però so benissimo perché non è stato fatto tutto ciò, perché è tutto così vago: serve a spingere lo spettatore di credere di essere davanti ad una storia ""complessa"", che richiede studio ed approfondimento. Consente inoltre al regista di fregarsene completamente della coerenza logica, e di far fare ai protagonisti un po' quel che vogliono, tanto non ha spiegato come funziona nulla, tutto è possibile. E' un metodo insulso non di fare cinema, ma proprio di impostare una sceneggiaturastoria. La realtà è che il film è un ricorrere di scenette sconclusionate tra loro, piene di jumpscare totalmente inutili, ed ancor peggio fraseggi filosofici di caratura infima tanto per far credere allo spettatore ""oh ma stanno parlando di etica, non può essere un film banale"". Veramente è un film di una povertà concettuale imbarazzante, tant'è che io non ci credevo che la storia fosse realmente ""ci sono i cattivi > arriva bambino speciale > uccide a caso tutti > fine"". Non ci credevo, perché oggettivamente non poteva essere così, ed invece quest'ombra colossale di banale oscenità mi ha ricoperto dopo 1h di visione, dove in fondo era palese che alla fine il succo fosse quello. La fotografia è apprezzabile, ma anche qui non siamo ai livelli di un Joker, dunque non prenderete dei frame e li incornicerete in stanza. Veramente non ho idea di cos'altro scrivere. La protagonista femminile ""cattivona"" è una gran bella donna, ma non so quanto questo possa valorizzare il tutto. C'è un multiculturalismo non indifferente, in questo film troverete qualsiasi sotto-classificazione antropologica esistente, tanto da risultare stucchevole. Da ridere c'è il fatto che dopo la visione fossi shockato, ed ho discusso con la mia ragazza che invece credeva di aver visto un capolavoro. Lei insisteva sui temi filosofici celati, la chiave di lettura. Io insistevo sul fatto che una ""chiave di lettura"" debba dare spunti di riflessione a spettatori particolarmente sensibili, non dare un senso ad una storia, che di per sé senso non ne ha. Anche perché non siamo di fronte ad un film riflessivo, artistico, ma di fronte ad un film veramente stile trash anni 90, dove ad un certo punto dopo le 2h, anche il regista si è stufato, e risolve la vicenda con una bella sparatoria tra buoni e cattivi ( la scena forse più trash ed oscena dell'intero film ). Il problema è sempre il solito: le persone giudicano un prodotto ancora prima di averne fruito."

Other than that, Sing is a rushed movie on so many aspects.  One being that the whole story changes because of something so stupid and unrealistic (an eyeball falling out of a lizards head), they should have put more thought into that. Another being that they use animals instead of humans, and they don't even act like Animals.  Disney's ""Zootopia"" at least follows the basis that they are still animals, even though they are basically human, they still have animal traits that have a roll on the story of Zootopia, Sing falls short in that.  The characters really feel bland and not interesting and hard to love.  Sing is one movie that is very forgettable and Illumination better pick up their act soon or just stick to Despicable Me, and even that they can't do.

It's not funny, unless you are two year old, and there are way to many characters to focus on. Thus every character in this film comes off as one dimensional and boring. with one exception, Johnny  the Gorilla. The only other good part about this movie is the ending scene which is when, shock of all shock, the characters actually preform full musical numbers. you see in the majority of the film we don't get full musical numbers just pits of the characters singing.

The production itself is mainly dark, which is understandable in a film like this and the director Craig William Macneill handles both the frontal nudity and the mother getting the ’40 wacks and her father 41’ discreetly up to a point. By the way, if the wacks are a spoiler you are too young to see this movie.

Chloe Sevigny, as Lizzie, is okay but she has yet to really impress me. Kristen Stewart, as the maid Bridget, adds another intriguing acting job in an independent film as she has done since playing Bella Swan in The Twilight Saga.

The cast including Jamey Sheridan as the father, Fiona Shaw as his wife, Kim **** as Lizzie’s sister Emma and Dennis O’Hare as an uncle all deliver the goods.

The most interesting part of “Lizzie” is the end credits when we learn what happened to Lizzie, Bridget and Emma leaving me to wonder how much of that information is true."

Run All Night

And we meet again. The writer Brad Ingelsby fascinates me. His writing procedure, his character and the way they travel in his plot tracks is equally intriguing. They take detours, they take uncalled stops, they bump into randomness and they also ask us to stop this everlasting train. And I know I usually give credit, at first. to the director who in this case is Jaume Collet-Serra. I just wanted to swoon over Brad's filmography and how it has caught my eye over the years. Not that I have anything new to add to those already said and observed things. This project, the stereotypical action thriller and it is extremely typical in its genre, has something else that I'd loved and exhaled over. It is its irrelevantly fast edited scenarios.

And not some physical action sequence but even a conversation is crisply edited out. No. Not crisply, but wrongly. Multiple times we can see the dialogues lapped over physical sequences to pace up the film in a briskly adventurous night. What it instead results into is a disappointing questionable set of scenarios that doesn't respect anything. Neither the action nor the characters nor the actors and what they are diving or dying or performing for is accounted into a disrespectful character.

Character, I say, for it repeatedly pops up on screen and also has his own arc in the sense that it gets less and less visible and annoying. Run All Night seems, is simply terribly edited. It cuts to another frame within a blink or like a blink. It feels unintentional, wrong and doesn't quite add up. There is a disturbance between conversation. This violence is much louder than any other explosives and bangs. And on the other hand, the final act is incredibly slow and settling which in its own way makes up for that uncalled editing that jumps back and forth."

It is an utter mess from start to finish and I am frankly quite surprised that the critics gave this average reviews.
Granted, the basic plotline is not too bad: Edie and Patsy are old and slowly losing their fabulous lifestyle they used to enjoy. There is quite a few important issues here: ageing, careers, sexism, materialism, etc. However, that is where the ingenuity ends. The execution of the film is utterly ridiculous. While the show used to be very sarcastic and basically make fun of people like Edie and Patsy, now that aspect of the story is lost. Their characters are shallow. There was no *real* character development from when the show ended in the 90's up until this moment - something that was supposed to happen.
Otherwise, the acting is a bit too slapsticky from everyone, as well as the entire production just seemed somehow as fake as the CGI background behind Kate Moss. And where does this ridiculous premise of Kate Moss come from any way?! Anyhow, aside from a chuckle here and there, and some fabulous outfits, there was little to take home from this.

She is a brilliant comic writer. Which is why it is so sad to see her talents not realized in Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie. There was such an urgency to include too much that there were so many missed opportunities for the film to have any real meaning. Gloria Bing could have lost Kate Moss as a client and Eddy and Gloria could have had a battle of butt kissing that would have been hilarious. On the plane, they could have thought they had first class tickets, sat down in FC, be treated llike royalty until it is discovered they are on the wrong plane and are forced to fly a low cost carrier and sit with whinny kids, a person with BO, etc. They could have employed their Little Britain friends to do the Come Fly With Me characters.There should have been a confrontation between Safron and Patsy. The police chasing Patsy and Eddy should have been drawn out and comical. Leaving Safron's daughter at the hotel to work as a maid should have been as meaningful as when Patsy sold Saffy in Morocco. They should have been detained at the airport for Patsy's suspicious items and had her inspected to where she enjoys it. A bomb threat at the airport or a fire alarm provides their escape or something from the airport. The one Patsy was going to marry should have been drawn out. Patsy gets to go to bed with him and dies in the middle of love making or something, spoiling their plans. She steals what she can from the house and makes a get away. When she marries the richest woman, she has to put a strap-on and doesn't know how to use. A comical scene could happen when she uses other items - a banana, a shoe, something funny. Before leaving for France, ""Tickets, money, passport"" was missing. Again, failed opportunities. I love AbFab and Jenifer Saunders which is why I was so disappointed with the movie.

What comes to mind watching this movie is a lame attempt from the early 2000's to try out something new before superhero movies were big.  But now superhero movies have been taken seriously for over a decade and there's no excuse for this kind of bad writing.

It starts out interesting enough but soon delves into a snorefest.  The first half of the movie I feel like Max is constantly running from something. STOP RUNNING AND DO SOMETHING INTERESTING, DAMN IT. When agents are chasing him there's nothing interesting to it. No badass fights...just Max doing what he does best, running. The first real fight he has is with a wind-like creature and like everything else, is uneventful. He does an energy blast to take it down and that's it. The fight seems very pointless and even by the end of the movie it has you scratching your head. The second fight is the last and with the main villain.  This fight is also uneventful where nothing cool happens. Most of it is the villain monologuing. When a villain has to explain the movie to you in one of the last scenes it shows how lazy the writers are. Don't have a character explain it all to me at the end, show me the story throughout the movie. Make me care about the villain and his motives, don't just vomit the point during the last fight. Give them interesting dialogue instead. Some other points:
I'm not sure what tone they were going for. It seemed to have a semi-serious tone but when Steel shows up the tone changes to a corny comedy. If it was going to be a corny comedy it should have started out as such. When Steel shows up Max's mom shouts from downstairs, ""dinner is ready"" (or something along those lines) but she can't hear Max when he's yelling and breaking stuff because he's freaked out when Steel appears? Also, nobody in the film seems to notice Steel. When Max keeps him in his backpack, Steel will be talking and Max can hear him but nobody else seems to really notice.  It's supposed to be for comedic relief  but it doesn't work if it doesn't make sense. The whole movie screams of crappy lazy writing.
Why did Max get his powers when they moved to that specific place? I don't think it was explained in the movie. The movie would have been so much better if it focused less on story and just tried to be a fun action-packed beat em up superhero movie. The story was so boring, didn't make sense, so obviously lazy, and devoid of any good action. They should have given just a little bit of story (that made sense) and made Max into a badass instead. Wrecking the day of the agents, having cool boss battles, etc.  Even if it ended up being mediocre it would have been a fun afternoon watch.

There's a lot more that's wrong with the movie but this is the stuff that comes to mind right now."

Max Steel is the worst movie i've seen this year.  It's unbelievably lazily thrown together, with choppy editing, some of the worst acting of the year, terrible writing, and an incomprehensible story that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Max himself is so unlikable, stupid, cowardly, and whiny.  When he learns that he has this weird new power, and meets this weird robot, he doesn't even freak out that much.  It's not: ""JESUS, WHAT THE F!@# IS HAPPENING WITH ME?!""  It's: ""Woah... what's going on?""  Max himself is so bland and unoriginal, it's hard to really emphasize with the guy.  Plus, the story is slow and boring, I actually almost fell asleep.  At 4 in the afternoon.  That's not a good sign when you're supposed to be a cool superhero movie.  Aside from terrible cinematography and awful editing, there really isn't much else to talk about.  Max Steel is the most forgettable, uninteresting, unfunny, and terribly made movie i've seen in 2016 so far.  Avoid at all costs.

Perhaps I should start with the mindset of the people on set. Word is that they wanted this movie to be PG, but they lost the appeal. Perhaps if they cut out the image of someone pulling out a piece of glass from their leg, maybe this movie would have been PG-rated. While I painfully go through this review, keep in mind that these are the people we're dealing with. Their thought process appears to be topsy-turvy.
Max Steel is the thankfully ill-fated adaptation of a line of action figure toys brought to us by Mattel, and if I had to sum up the plot, I would point to Transformers (2007), saying that the two movie have a rather similar plot (not the same, but somewhat similar). Good grief, this movie is cinematic cyanide through and through.
The plotline is continually stupid, followed by the cinematography, which is even worse (especially during one particular scene where the camera couldn't stop cutting from one place to another every 10 or so seconds). The characters are not only bland, but inert and completely weak. Yet, the movie expects me to like a romance between two characters that proves to be even more bland, formulaic, and stupid. These issues are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the problems with this sci-fi time-waster. Even a 12 minute video rant won't be enough for me to summarize this atrocity that deliberately pursued the Golden Raspberry Awards with a seal of disavowal."

The Tax Collector doesn't contribute anything relevant or exciting and is perhaps David Ayer's most disappointing work to date.

As for the choices made in the story, why on god's green Earth would a teacher need a public defender to defend her in a civil court? And why on great Zeus' Olympus would a teacher be in trouble for uttering the name Jesus? The court cases that have been mentioned in the end credits were examples of Christians doing the persecuting. The real message of the 'God's not Dead' franchise, I believe is this: ""If you don't allow me to persecute you, then you are persecuting me.""

This and the previous instalment of the 'God's not Dead' franchise is trying too hard to get people to believe in Christianity. It's like a sales representative trying too hard to convince a customer to get an extended warranty even after the customer repeatedly says no.

Unfortunately it's still horribly boring and false. Like the first one, it is purely a fictitious plot without precedent - don't let messages in the film itself deceive you otherwise - and serves as a straw man to demonize enemies of the Family Research Council.

These enemies, whose vendettas with Christianity can be neatly summed up as, ""First World problems"" compared to any actual religious persecution that occurs today, include the ACLU, who form the antagonists of this film. Yes, a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union, those ""evil"" guys who desegregated American education and are currently fighting against targeted assassinations of American citizens without trial, are represented by Ray Wise, an actor who has portrayed Satan in recent history, as the prosecution.

Other enemies of the Family Research Council were tackled in the previous entry: atheists, the educational elite (those NERDS!!), Muslims, and Confucianists. They are all enemies for pretty much the same reasons, which include but are not limited to: racism, anti-intellectualism, respecting your parents more than your religious leaders, being susceptible to extending civil rights to traditionally unprivileged sexualities and genders, and ancient feuds that modern Christians don't really understand.

For example: Christian and Muslim rivalry began when the Papal theocracies of the middle ages tried and failed to expel Muslim people permanently from the so-called ""Holy Land."" In response to mild - even milder than the Middle East today - mistreatment, Christians became responsible for the first ever documented (i.e. recorded) case of human cannibalism during the Siege of Ma'arra in what is modern day Syria. As if the killing and digestion of women and children were not hypocritical enough, Christians continue this proud tradition of hypocrisy today by producing propaganda for the silver screen. This is because they are no longer formally backed by an entire continent of career warriors and are a bit more sheepish about their sociopathy now. For that matter, this is also true of pretty much any modern religion, though I'm sure the militant Islamic sects would pretend otherwise.

I prefer it much better this way. Clearly no one is being convinced by these films; it is purely fodder for Christians to confirm their biases in the way they are familiar with: unprecedented parable.

Feel free to actually look up the court cases listed in the credits. You will find that there is nothing approaching the antipathy toward Christians in any of them, no matter how much the Family Research Council pretends.

Since I was doing a service to the producers of the film by seeing it, I did not pay anything to watch it. You're welcome, Harold Cronk and David A.R. White. I would advise the reader of this review against a similar service, though. Spend those two hours exercising, fixing up the house, or working at the food bank.

Overall, a harsh, angry tone pervaded the film. I walked out of the theater feeling ready to rip **** apart, rather than feeling blessed and filled with the Holy Spirit (I think 2015's War Room did better on that account). I agree with Consequence of Sound reviewer who wrote that the scene in the church by the Martin character playing Nearer My God to Thee was the most hearfelt true scene (see this: ****/2016/04/film-review-gods-not-dead-2/

The characters are all unlikable and never have any more depth to them besides their one piece of the backstory they are given. The major thing I cannot forgive is this movie sets up rules to the island and they break their own rules. The ending of the movie makes so little sense and breaks the rules the movie says and it basically just gives us this **** sandwich. Talking about that ending the lack of balls this movie has is outstanding. It can't even keeps characters gone basically no one is ever in any real danger apparently and the twist is so stupid for an end of third act reveal that you are left with a ""wait what"" feeling.

Surely my review would annoy those who liked it. But the majority of who saw it was felt just like me. It has been 20 years since the first 3D animated feature film came. Not all the films released in this period were great. Some were technically sounded good and some were stories. If you had seen 'Hoodwinked!', you would know how awesome that story was, despite the poor animation production. But this film failed in all the department.

I recently finished watching the first season of 'Trollhunters' and 'Miraculous Ladybug'. Even the television made products were much better than this film. Small budget, small production house et cetera is not an excuse. Thankfully, this is not the only bad animated feature I've seen so far in my life, but sadly it joins the list of those titles.

Maybe! The little kids could enjoy it, who does not know to differentiate between good and bad. But for the adults, this is definitely skippable film. The best thing about this film was the message it carried, though, even for an animated film and a fantasy film, not convincing enough. It was kind of very similar to 'Delhi Safari'. In some perspective, I thought it was a remake of that. There are lots of other films similar to this like 'Chole & Theo', 'Happy Feet' and so on that you can try them instead.

Unlike a cheesy fun disaster movie like Armageddon or 2012, Geostorms serious tone doesn't suit the cheesy fun set pieces. Armageddon was fun with plenty of cheese but that felt right in that movie because it didn't take itself too seriously and had comedy elements. Geostorm is super serious in its delivery and would have been less rubbish if it had stayed grounded and intelligent like Deep Impact or Twister instead of going wild with the plot and over the top scenarios. The acting is alright just bland characters with dull dialogue. The parts that made me go from disliking this to hating it was the nonsense Science, the cringe action scenes and the stupid twist halfway through. The science in this movie doesn't make sense and logic is out the window. If you like science you will hate this film. The action is mindless and cringy. During the action you end up internally saying ""Yeah right, like that would happen"" because what you see is something ridiculous happening in a dead serious all be it bad movie.

It's real bad. Honestly not sure what I expected with this one, though."

It's so bad it's good, kind of thing. So it deserves a low score, but you know why you want to watch this, if you're into this kind of thing at all. They speak in this weird, forced, official language that is really hard to follow. Half of the time, you have no idea what's actually going on. The solution to a problem is literally super handy and within easy reach, building no tension. Everyone is convinceable. The bad guy is a stereotype pur sang. The actors seem to have no idea what direction they want to go on and their well-tried efforts did not come out well from the editing room. It's so ridiculously edited, at one point they try to portrey 4 global disasters going one, while also telling a story down on Earth and one on the space ship. Which ends up with this... off-balanced act of fitting all the pieces together, it becomes surreal in the process. Must watch if you want to have a laugh at a good effort to make a decent movie, but lacks heavily in the the dialogue and editing."

In fact, there is stiff competition for the film's internal stupidity award. At first you think that the ludicrous ""science"" the movie seems to take seriously will run away with the win. But then you notice the atrocious ""acting"" and hammy dialog, and the race is back on. But to the astute viewer a dark horse should appear at some point in the appallingly inaccurate portrayal of American politics and the kind of swine who are now the only ones who could possibly become American presidents. If we're lucky he's a mindless party hack. If not, a crazed ideologue bent on world war. But, lo and behold and extreme sphincter contracting shock, the president is a hero in Geostorm. Who would have thunk it? Hollywood never does that angle to death, right? But this is not all, lest you are still not convinced. Cars explode as if they are not just loaded with explosives but actually built from them. Pompous music blares loudly over everything, because otherwise us poor peasants wouldn't know how to feel about things, there is a tacked on family intrigue as if people who build space stations and work in governments are real people instead of soulless sociopaths. There is even an unrealistic ninja woman, exactly like in The Matrix, except not good. And guns have unlimited ammunition. Hooray! And sprinkled on top are all the movie cliches in the world, from the main characters appear to die but are ""surprisingly"" hiding off camera to surprise the villain cliche to the blase banter that all Hollywood couples for some reason engage in, but which never actually happens in the real world cliche. And everything in between obviously: Door stops bullets cliche, the patriotic self sacrifice cliche, heroic president cliche as I mentioned, driving backwards while shooting a handgun at a pursuing vehicle cliche, speaking in code to fool the evildoers cliche, etc, etc ,etc. Trust me, it's jam packed with all the cliches you could possibly think of. I gave up counting due to extreme lack of interest at around 40. And they are not subtle either. They are completely over the top, with cue music for the dullards watching, as if things weren't already super obvious enough. GAAH!

I'm sorry, but I'm burned out now. There are just so many idiotic things about Geostorm that I have a headache from trying to remember all of them. And not only that, but it is more globalist propaganda, evidently aimed at the lowest common denominator, to put it politely. The people who made this movie, whose names I refuse to remember, and for that matter anyone who takes any part of it seriously in any way, should be shot out into space themselves as a matter of public sanitation.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,AndrewBurge,"May 3, 2018",0,"Let me just get this out of the way first: I have no problem with offensive humor. As long as something which aims to be funny is funny, it means it has served its purpose. The offensiveness is almost always worth it. On that note, Dan Mazer's 'Dirty Grandpa' manages to be offensive without being funny. Seriously, there are barely any jokes here which land. The best of which being one involving a scatophilic fantasy by retired Army veteran **** Kelly (Robert De Niro) involving Queen Latifah and a hot air balloon, but only because De Niro used every single of his acting chops to deliver it as wacky and sudden as possible.

Alas, though! Not ever double Oscar winner Robert De Niro can save this sick and disgusting mess. It seems that writer John Phillips has the philosophy that as long as something is offensive, it has to be funny. But, of course! We love laughing at a drawing of a **** swastika shown to a rabbi, or mindless and absurd drug consumption or even accidental child pornography! We are a bunch of sick pervs! We do not require any attempt at trying to control this controversial scenes through humor. I mean, hey - its offensive so its gotta be funny. Right?

And this is not even the worst part! What really makes this film implode upon itself is the failure of its director of getting the best out of scenes which could have intelligent humor potential. One such example is when well-cut and straight as an arrow lawyer Jason Kelly (Zac Efron) ends up in jail after being led into drug consumption. He starts a conversation with the local police guards about human rights and law all while the two policemen mock him all while favoring the local drug dealer. But this scene progressively gets worse and worse and instead of dropping out of it, director Mazer keeps pushing transforming it into senseless, illogical and, at times, even disturbing gibberish.

To be honest, at the start, this looked like a pretty mediocre film. But close to the end, it gets messy and straight-up racist making a mockery of the African-American culture's use of the N-word, among others. It is offensive but not funny, aims to give family principles but ends up pairing an old retiree with a teenage girl and worst, is De Niro's worst screen choice yet... God knows we need 'The Irishman' now more than ever."

There's really not an underuse of characters, but the overuse of a few characters and the 'idiot cop gag' lead to gaps in the film being completely laugh free. Audrey Plaza, Zac Efron, and Robert De Niro all give wacky, completely unrealistic character performances and deliver lines with the attempt to create belly laughs, but John M Phillips writing services them nothing interesting to say. The most problematic issue was the over-the-top drama towards the end of the film that felt incredibly forced and unnatural. Overall, each actor in this 'comedy' deserves the respect that none of their performances felt like this film was just another pay check for them. Plus the editing and cinematography is well done for the most part. Dirty Grandpa, however, is just too unfunny to be considered even a decent comedy, since very little of the dialogue and visuals provide much more than uncomfortable chuckles."

Basically it boils down to an old widowed ""grandpa"" who just wants to do all the ""dirty"" stuff he could not do while he was faithfully married to grandma. If you sit back and do not take anything too seriously - as in plot line or script - it is very funny from beginning to **** grandpa relives a frat party kinda way! 9 for acting - especially from Deniro, 7 for script and 5 for the predictable plot line...

The movie is a great way to escape into 90 minutes of a ridiculously raunchy funny ""dirty grandpa"" leading his buttoned up grandson from one obscenely raunchy scene to another. What made it work for me was Deniro! He is a veteran genius actor who - no matter what movie he is in - can still carry any scene or movie he wants! Considering the plot line and script was predictable Efron and Deniro played well off each other as the movie jumped from one ridiculous scene to another.

In the end it is a great movie to just sit back drink a beer or two and laugh without expecting much more other than funny acting from Deniro. 90 minutes of grandpa acting and talking like a dirty old man - while his grandson trys to understand what the heck is wrong with my grandpa! I laughed from beginning to end and at least in the past most raunchy frat style movies - ranging from Porky's to Bad Grandpa - made me laugh far less.

La historia inicia con el funeral de la abuela de Jason (Zack Efron), donde él se presenta como un joven recto con grandes aspiraciones, a punto de casarse e iniciar su vida laboral en la firma de abogados de su padre. Todo cambia cuando aparece **** (Robert De Niro), su abuelo, quien le pide que postergue su itinerario para acompañarlo en un pequeño viaje para hacer honor a la difunta.
Las expectativas comienzan a caer en picada tras la siguiente escena, donde devela la corriente humorística que utilizará durante la siguiente hora. Escenas vulgares, hacer objeto de las mujeres, bromas fálicas y personajes estúpidos e incoherentes son las cartas que utiliza para entretener, y está bien si eso te divierte, pero comparándolo con otras comedias este film ni siquiera intenta hacer algo distinto o nuevo.
El elenco no sobresale, De Niro solo cumple con su rol y Efron como positivo tiene una escena donde canta. Los actores secundarios son olvidables, sus personajes carecen de profundidad o carisma, solo sirven para dar pista a los remates de los protagonistas.
Si buscas reírte y pasar un buen tiempo evita “Dirty Grandpa”, es guion cutre que solo explota la popularidad de los actores principales."

First i will start with the few bright spots of this movie. The bright spot is Robert De Niro. The film the story the jokes were terabille but he was good in this movie. I just can't understand why is he picking so many bad projects. The other one was Zac Efron he was good in this movie too and the chemistry between them were great. But the rest of this movie is just pure garbage. The directing was horrible scenes where constructed so poorly and transitions between them where so unbelievable horrible the tone was pure garbage too. The script was abhorrent. It is one of the worst script's ever. Characters are written awfuly. The story is non existent, motivations are a joke, the dialog is hideous it is honestly disgusting. The joke's where so bad they were so dreadful. I hated the jokes so much. because they went for shock value and they achieved it i was shoked i wasn't laughing tho i was disgusted.n this whole movie there is only one decent scene and that's after credits scene that i smiled And thats it this movie just wasn't funny at all."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,LeZee,"Jun 4, 2016",3,"The usual, nothing innovative about it!

Everything I wrote was just my personal opinion, definitely not intended to offend anybody. This should have been one of the best comedies of the year, but now it belongs to one of the worst. I recommend 'Grandma' instead this which I felt a much better comedy.

At this age, Robert De Niro was unbelievably awesome, though his character needed a good support from another and that's where as usual Zac failed to deliver his part. I would have preferred someone like Taylor Lautner who's desperate for a breakthrough than the Zac who ruins always.

The screenplay was from the 'blacklist', knowing this they should have been more careful while casting for it. The story was okay, because it was not meant for one of the greatest films of all time. It was sort of a weekend getaway or the bachelor party theme, but the film gives its original reason and then those developed plots were too familiar if you have seen plenty of teen films, in the party theme.

It's supposed to make us laugh, but there are lots of outdated humours tried in the unusual route to narrate them. The grandfather-grandson combo was an excellent idea, the main plot revolves around them and it should have remained that way, but the undetermined romance was an interruption. Or they should have developed a decent romance track for a better balance in the genre.

At least it would have been all right if it was a teen film. Many of those who appeared in it were actually too old to represent the roles given to them. That's fine too, because films are fake, everything is make-up and performance, but none were at their best except De Niro and Aubrey Plaza. It is definitely a film to skip, that's my opinion, but they're a few who are defending it, so be careful that I'm not always right and they're not always wrong if you want to choose it.

Its's data-trash."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/211/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,MeritCoba,"Mar 10, 2019",3,"It is one of those Netflix flicks I saw because I wanted to see Nicholas Cage act.  Weird, I admit, as Cage isn't known for sublime performances. But that is precisely why! Someone pointed out that Cage's acting could be seen as deliberately anti-acting. Like, let's say, the Joker as played by Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight Cage is over the top, but while Ledger pulls it off marvelously, Cages over-acting is often a dud. Perhaps often is an understatement. But with 211 Cage surprises again by putting in a such a run-of-the-mill performance that one can only giggle.. and giggle and giggle some more.

Cage is in good company(or is that bad?) as the rest of the cast is as bland as used teabags.  There is kind of attempt to make us care for them as the various non-entities get introduced during the long winded first part of the movie, but it doesn't pay off when it should. It is a half-assed attempt anyway, which is why some of the people have no names at all. Oh yes, the fat bloke is shot in the head. Ah yes, the son-in-law is on the verge of dying after being shot(and boo-hoo he has just heard that he has become a father). It makes me pause to consider what makes us connect to **** feel the hurt they feel. Or at least sympathize. Using tropes like: man-hears-he-becomes-a-father-just-before-facing-mortal-peril puts me off. Come on! And of course he doesn't die. It isn't even a spoiler to say so.. it is that kind of movie.(It would at least have been inspired if she wasn't pregnant as he turns out to be infertile. Or she ups and leaves. You know, like real life people sometimes do).

The movie tries to take the serious angle by declaring to be inspired by real life events, but it is just that: inspired, not based on. If they would have based it on the North Hollywood Shootout(which is the one they mean), they would have altered the movie significantly. For one, there was never a pause. The two dudes(not four) came out and the fight was on: what you would call a running battle. There were also no hostages. But the movie has the robbers sit inside the bank for some time with hostages, so where the heck is the negotiator? And why show the police as having AR-15 as the lack of them was the whole point in the real shootout: that the police did not have the necessary firepower to stop the heavily armed and armored robbers?(It is just infuriating when you watch an interview with a former LAPD Swat team member who explains just that and why it can not happen now and this movie gets exactly this point wrong).

Then the Swat team does arrive - which takes ages unlike with the real shootout -, they get time to set up the assault and do so is a very clumsy way. As said: there is no negotiator but there are also no snipers and the teams only use what must be a smoke grenade. And why they heck do they press the assault when the hostages are send out?

But possibly the worst part of the movie is the utter unrealistic carelessness for human suffering with the cops. When the backup arrives with their AR-15's, they waist no time to shower the bank with a hail of bullets while it is obvious that they have hostages in there and it is very likely they hit them first. In addition they leave one of the survivors of the coffee cup bombing unattended while it is clear she is in a terrible state. And finally they don't give a rats ass that Cage has an obvious nervous breakdown after being on the receiving end of a barrage of bullets and thinking his son-in-law has died. But the only thing the officer in charge does is telling him to calm down. It is almost like the slap-in-the-face trope, without the slap in the face. But anyway, in this movie it works as Cage then takes charge and goes Rambo.

There is an utter lack of seriousness in the whole movie that tries to pawn itself off as being serious. And there lies the issue. There is so much unrealism in this movie(a band of experienced mercenaries robbing a bank for a trifle?) that the whole inspiration becomes silly. If this is inspired by real life events, then Lord of the Rings is inspired by the First World War, Star wars by the American revolution, and Pearl Harbor by Pearl Harbor(and one of these might actually be true). It would have been better if they had not taken this all too serious, but just made a stupid action flick with an over the top bad/good guy. Cage can do that. That is his thing.

This is another Netflix dud. Netflix Orginal is becoming a byword for underperforming. Netflix: get a hold of yourself. Merit"
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/211/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,Tss5078,"Nov 16, 2018",3,"By now, my regular readers will know that I absolutely love Nicholas Cage, however being a super fan comes with some complications. The fact is that Cage is one of the most active stars in Hollywood, willing to take on any role, and there in lies the problem. His most recent film, 211, may be one of the most pointless and uninteresting action films ever made. Four mercenaries who are looking to get back at their corrupt boss, start robbing banks where he keeps his money. This leads them to the small town of Chesterfield, where a job is interrupted by the police, leading to a stand-off. Cage stars as Mike Chandler, an officer nearing his retirement, saddled with his son-in-law as a partner. What made 211 so bad is that the stand-off and shoot outs take over the majority of the time and Dog Day Afternoon, this film is not. Aside from the occasional expletives, there are long shoot out sequences with no dialogue. When the action cools down and people finally do speak, it's actually worse, because then the lack of experience and talent of the supporting cast is painfully evident. Action movies are supposed to be exciting and get the blood pumping, even if the story isn't all that great, it's something the genre has lived on since the 1970s, but 211 is an action filmed that bored me. When one is watching an action film and nodding off, it is an indicator that something is seriously wrong with that film.

The fact that it wasn’t pre-screened for critics, opening cold Friday was sort of a hint that it wasn’t good and it isn’t. There is about one minute with a limbo contest between Freeman and Jones that may give you a hint of a smile but that is it! Freeman fares the best but that is strictly due to his persona.

I seldom, if ever, negative about performers looks but I have to make a few general comments here. Both Freeman and Jones are aging fine up to this point but of the women I wish Elizabeth Ashley hadn’t appeared on the screen as I once thought this woman was beautiful but, to me, that’s not true anymore. I didn’t, gratefully, recognize Jane Seymour during the movie and had to check the credits out to see what part she played.

I am not just picking on the women as I am still shaking my head over my ‘idol’, for many reasons, Johnny Mathis! We are both the same age but he looks 20 years older than he should plus the two songs he sang didn’t sound like the Mathis I know.

Sometimes a movie is so bad it becomes a cult film but this is so bad it should just disappear and never be shown again!"

It is also one of the most offensive, insulting, and insipid movies I have ever had the misfortune of watching. Dan Fogleman's script is nothing short of emotionally manipulative drivel. I almost can't believe that he wrote and directed this hack-job.

The biggest problem with Life Itself is that it doesn't trust the audience to understand and make connections with the characters. It sets up contrived plot devices and tragedies with no originality and then has the balls to laud itself unironically as ""unique and original."" It has the unmitigated STONES to compare itself to Pulp Fiction. This movie is nothing like Pulp Fiction. If anything, Life Itself is a less-good rip-off of 500 Days of Summer and Manchester By The Sea, but it doesn't even understand how those two movies work.

The premise of Life Itself is that there are two families tied together by a single traumatic event. Characters are drowned in horrible tragedies, there is a Spanish sub-plot that feels tacked on, and the fact that the script tries to tie it all together at the end to make a profound statement is so degrading that the only real tragedy is that I wasted my time watching this movie at all. The movie's theme is ""Life Itself is the ultimate unreliable narrator."" The movie has no problem spoon-feeding you this theme and saying it out loud word-for-word multiple times during the movie. Talk about a stupid waste of a title-drop. I loved This Is Us, but now I am convinced that Dan Fogelman is a ****."

by JOAN ALPERIN on SEPTEMBER 18, 2018

A CELEBRATION OF LIFE ITSELF
Writer/director Dan Fogelman is currently represented on TV with his creation This Is Us, which follows two parents and their three children, born on the same day as their father. Now entering its third season, the NBC show takes place in the present but also utilizes flashbacks so we see how events in the past shape who the characters are today.

In Life Itself – which opens in cinemas this week — Fogelman uses a similar technique, but now weaves together a story that concerns multiple couples over numerous generations and how they are all connected by one event.

It begins with Will (excellent Oscar Isaac) and Abby (Olivia Wilde), who are first shown at a college party, where Will says he’s “just waiting for the right moment” to ask her out. “Because when I ask you out, there’s not going to be any turning back for me.” At one point, he becomes the narrator of his story informing us that “he loves her like a stalker.”
We then find a disheveled Will at the office of his shrink (Annette Bening), where he relates that it’s strange to think about how a completely random moment would shape an entire life. Then it’s back to Abby and Will, now madly in love, married and pregnant.

Fate will link them to Dylan (Olivia Cooke) a troubled young woman trying to find her way in the world, and her grandfather Irwin (Mandy Patinkin). Then it’s off to Spain where we meet a rich plantation owner, Mr. Saccione (the wonderful Antonio Banderas), his plantation manager Javier (Sergio Peris-Mencheta), and Javier’s wife Isabel (Laia Costa) and their son Rodrigo (Alex Monner). It’s their poignant story that will take one of them back to where the film began — the streets of New York City.

Spanning decades as well as continents, the film explores the human condition and all its complications: love, family, tragedy, joy, fate and — in the end — life itself. While some may see this tearjerker as manipulative, I absolutely loved every second of it, my favorite of the year so far.

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lovers/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,quincytheodore,"Jul 19, 2015",3,"For such cosmetically grand movie, The Lovers is unbearably bland. In a way the movie reminds me of Jackie Chan's The Myth. Both follow the story of a researcher in a quest to find ancient artifact. Along the way his consciousness is mysteriously and magically transported across space and time. Thus, he relives the past life in awkward parallel perspective. It has all sorts of epic romance fantasy elements, all of them are merely skin deep, and most importantly it lacks any charm on the characters.

The main problem is the movie tries so hard to pack beautiful scenery, it sporadically shift sequences without establishing the character in any meaningful manner. First act alone sees myriad of subplots, it immediately enters a conspiracy, political and love banters. Note that it opens with two different timelines and stories, so when the movie introduces predicament so suddenly, it barely gives any sense of familiarity for the characters and audience probably wouldn’t care much for them.

Writing is similar to astrology reading, fortune telling, or straight up fortune cookie gibberish. It wants to be a romantic lore, yet it sounds very pretentious with its ""love conquers all"" cliché. This ultimately ruins the characters as even though the cast is good, the material barely give them any depth or recognizable trait other than fantasy wannabes. The drive for relationship is simply absent.

It doesn't create momentum, and the drab pace continues, or even worsens towards the end. It's as though the vistas are the actual star and these people are the background. There are some good views here, it's clearly an above average production with costumes, intricate sets and occasional action scattered between. However, without amiable personalities, it becomes a boring escapade with cheap plastic romance.

Flair for aesthetic won't help much if the core human drama is overwhelmingly barren."

It’s mundane, it’s carelessly stupid, the film is only funny when it’s unintentional, the acting is completely flat, the dialogue is just UGH, there’s no coherent direction due to the film not sticking to one story, so many gaping plot points and questions are shown and asked, none of which actually get answered or resolved, every attempt at forced emotion fails and if anything, Keanu Reeves is basically acting like a parody of himself in a half-assed performance, like how he was in the 80’s and 90’s. Speaking of 80’s and 90’s, I think that’s the best way to describe this movie: it’s a bad 80’s sci-fi flick, 90’s sci-fi flick released in the dumping grounds of January. And boy does it feel like it. Nothing in this film makes any sense. And you wanna know what also doesn’t make sense?

En vérité, rien de très sérieux là-dedans, sauf vers la fin via un rebondissement ou plutôt une révélation moisie de derrière les poubelles dont la grognasse insipide Vanessa Hudgens se fait la porte-parole… ridicule de bout en bout, d’ailleurs ! Par contre, on apprécie la belle Katheryn Winnick dans ce rôle secondaire de femme fatale d’une ironie cynique bien agréable. Elle seule et bien entendu l’excellent Mads Mikkelsen (comme d’habitude) tirent un brin leur épingle du jeu dans ce film qui se traîne un tantinet quand même.

Un film qui peut faire sourire de temps en temps par ses excentricités et sa violence exagérée, lesquelles sont nettement inspirées des tarantinades et autres ritchieries volontiers provocatrices qui plaisent tant aux ados (idiots). Notons par ailleurs que l’on voit ici et là de la chair plus ou moins fraîche de bonnasses plus ou moins bonnes mais nous ne ferons pas la fine bouche à cet égard, car… c’est plutôt rare par les temps qui courent !

La réalisation est dans l’ensemble très moyenne, pour ne pas dire pire, la faute à un montage trop souvent cut dans l’action (sanglante certes) qui aurait mérité bien plus d’attention.

This film has a minus numer of redeeming qualities, it literally made me dumber watching it not to mention angry.
Whoever sanctioned its production must have had their family held at gunpoint because I cannot think of any other reason why such a dire film would make it off a script checking level.
The portrayal of First People in this film are truly horrendous not to mention a complete travesty of any sort of accuracy (I am aware it was supposed to be a comedy) this wouldn’t be a problem if it were done in a clever ,self aware way a la Snatch but I got no hint that this film was even aware of quite how offensive and damaging it’s abuse of a nations people it was trashing.
I know sandler has some sort of watertight deal to make films akin to Princes record deal but holy **** this stinker was a new low for him and that really is saying something. If you are reading this avoid this film like you would a maggot filled corpse dangerously bloated in the full sun.
I truly hope someone sues sandler into obscurity for this shower of ****"

And I was not surprised to find that it was just as bad as one could imagine. Sandler gave quite possibly the worst performance of his career. I gave it a 1 because it appeared to have good production value.
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-ridiculous-6/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,bfoore90,"Jan 18, 2016",1,"Even for just being a Netflix original, this movie was awful just downright awful and atrocious to watch. There is literally nothing redeemable about this movie, yeah you may chuckle here and there but there is literally nothing redeemable about Adam Sandler's latest attempt to make a even mildly entertaining movie. Thats the frustrating thing, I believe Adam Sandler can act and can make a good movie. Hes proven it in in the past with good movies like Reign Over Me, Spanglish, Punchdrunk Love, Funny People, or even Click but he continues to waste away his career with these pointless and downright lazy films that he actually thinks people will find funny. His performance in this movie even seems phoned in,  Taylor Lautner is bad and while the rest of the cast manage to do a decent job at being not as bad. It almost doesn't help their case that the film has almost no story of substance, the dialogue is laughable, and the characters are lower than anything youd come to expect in an adam sandler flick. Its lazy film making and a perfect example of just how lazy Adam Sandler has become."

Another rehash of the same stupid jokes that haven't worked, ever. Just when ou thought he couldn't possibly make a stupider movie, he does. Skip this. Go watch Happy Gilmore again instead."
https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-ridiculous-6/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,Jacob,"Jan 7, 2016",3,"The Ridiculous Six joins the ranks of Happy Madison failures. While none of the characters in this film nail biting obnoxious as in previous Madison films like Eight Crazy Nights and Jack & Jill it’s still not enough. After the six are assembled they go from one distraction to another on their slow journey most of which is unmemorable and leads to a dull a film. None of the Ridiculous Six are entertaining each of which leading to one the Happy Madison comedy wheel of poop, race, and stupid voices. Except for Sandler who plays the role surprisingly serious contrasting to the supposed comedic tone of the film. The deadpan role is so serious you’ll somewhat miss his stupid voices or at least wish he was doing red-face. While last year’s western comedy A Million Ways to Die in the West occasional found some gold in its dry river The Ridiculous Six is as dull and dry as the desert it is set in."

The plot of the movie is predictable and pointless.
Adam Sandler is the good and special guy that faces a mediocre situation to end the movie with the highest number of friends once again. He poses as a skilled boss-like character, which is not funny, on a comedy movie.
Rob Schneider's role hide his potential as a comedy actor, not even quite funny. He is a Mexican guy that has a mule that literally jets ****. Whoever thought this was a good idea has a disgusting sense of humor.
Taylor Lautner has the best acting, but his role is excessively dumb and is not even close to funny.
Jorge Garcia's role is the most disgusting character I ever see. He doesn't say a single word and the character is pointed to have sex with animals.
Terry Crew's role, and Luke Wilson's, has no reason to exist. Really. Not funny, once again.
In summary, don't watch this movie. Even a knock-knock joke is funnier than this movie."

https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-ridiculous-6/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,Spike23,"Dec 24, 2015",0,"There is a fine line between amusement and stupidity, which means that Adam Sandler's Happy Madison films can have only two outcomes. Both of these types are stupid, offensive and awkward. The first type makes you laugh and when you try to calm down, you realize you were laughing because of something really not that funny and probably very awkward, which makes you laugh even more (Strange Wilderness, That's My Boy).

Unfortunately, the second type makes you want to erase from your memory all the traces of how lame and boring that was and bury all the copies of that film in the bottom of the ocean, so nobody would ever make this horrible mistake of watching that film, like you just did.

The Ridiculous 6 is according to me the worst scenario of the second type. Probably even worse than Jack & Jill, which i thought I would never say in my entire life."

I'm guessing Sandler wrote each scene as the director was yelling ""Action!"". And what's the point? If you're going to make a comedy, then add some humor... or do an actual parody. This was neither. Aren't you trying to make people laugh? The premise was doable, but then, this happened(?) Adam, send me your scripts. I will re-write them for you. Stop pretending to be a screenplay writer - you're not. I love westerns and I love comedies, but god good this was embarrassingly bad. I'm so glad I didn't pay for this in a theater."
