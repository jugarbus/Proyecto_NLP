It's been a while since I've seen a picture with this much grit, restraint and respect for the story, and that makes the last half-hour feel transcendent, even if it's also strikingly bittersweet. Michael Keaton is excellent in another Best Picture winner, his second in as many years, and Mark Ruffalo shows tremendous passion and fire in a major ensemble effort.

There's nothing flashy or indulgent about Spotlight, a rarity nowadays, and that vacancy leaves room for us to observe and appreciate the difficult, compounded, thankless efforts of these masters of their profession. It's also, often, a stark reminder that 2001 (where the movie is set) wasn't just yesterday. The world has changed fundamentally over the ensuing years, and it's surprising how often this comes across, effectively, as a period piece. Essential viewing for a wide variety of reasons."

Tom McCarthy's 'Spotlight' portrays the Boston Globe's investigative articles on the Catholic Church's cover-up of pedophile abuse by a significant percentage of its priests in the Boston area.

The movie wastes no time in it's 2 hours and 9 minutes with on-the-edge-of-your-seat pacing. Every interaction is meaningful, every character believable, as layer after layer of the Catholic churches systemic cover-up is unfolded. It is the best newspaper movie ever produced (#2 All-Time Greatest Film).

But the underlying relationships of the ""Spotlight"" investigative team that thrives as a proxy family is the element that makes this movie so appealing.

Idealic respect shared between the characters and the professional bond that the diverse personalities have for each other is laid out by McCarthy over the course of the movie. Like close siblings whose love and common bond allow for overlooking each others idiosyncrasies and grow stronger under duress, the characters navigate the religious, social, community, political and legal challenges of bringing such an impacting story to press.

'Spotlight' is flawless in execution. Every facet (writing, casting, acting, direction, cinematography, and editing), mixes together to yield 2015's Best Picture, and resides at the very top of my list of best films since 2000, #2 All-Time, and the ONLY film to ever make my ""Top 100 Greatest Films of All Time"" in its first year of release (moved up into Top 25 the next year and just became eligible (min. 5 years from release date) for my Top 5 List>

Gross Sales/Theatre Attendance:

Distributed/opened in November, 2015 primarily through ""Art Movie"" houses, and in a blockbuster year that included Stars Wars, 007, and Jurassic franchise films, Spotlight barely cracked the top 100 domestically In 2015.

Since 2015, however, its rental/pay-for-view and at-large streaming numbers have done quite well, with a 300% increase in gross revenue via both positive word of mouth testimonials and critics' praises, making the film financially relevant.

'Spotlight' continues to return profits to it's investors, and gives evidence that great films are in high demand by audiences, can succeed financially, and make excellent investments for the movie industry at large."
12,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spotlight/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,AJ_13,"Jan 11, 2021",8,A really well made journalism movie. It has an amazing cast and narrates an interesting yet sad story. It makes you feel like you are a reporter.
13,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spotlight/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,FilipeNeto,"Dec 13, 2020",10,"This is one of the most interesting films I have seen in recent times. The script is based on real facts, namely the journalistic investigation that publicized the scandal of child abuse in the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, USA. However, the film goes further and even establishes links between these investigation and similar scandals that have happened in other countries.

I am a historian, but I am also an employee of the Catholic Church. I am not a priest, but I work with many priests, and I have some friends in the priesthood. So, I have a vision of the interior of the Church that most people don't have. And the Church, in spite of being universal, is also fragile and has an increasing fear of what can be said about her. It is understandable: the strength of the Church resides in people who go to Mass, make offerings, help with charitable works and collaborate with her. And the truth is that, despite the weight that the Church still has, it has been questioned in traditionally Catholic regions such as the Mediterranean, Latin America and parts of the USA. There are fewer baptisms and marriages, the social weight of the clergy is inferior, there are fewer candidates for the priesthood and the number of practitioners has decreased. The Church is strong and powerful, but it is increasingly isolated and discredited. This is a concern for the Catholics and yes, the fear of public opinion explains the way the Church tries to solve internal problems with minimal waves. The film shows the way a cardinal hid what was going on... and he was really wrong. What he should have done was to suspend the priests and allow them, not as clerics, but as citizens, to be held accountable for their actions. If they were condemned by civil law, they would also be punished by canonical rules. That would have been ideal, but always letting the man, and not the priest, be responsible for his actions.

The issue of celibacy for priests is addressed in the film as one of the causes of child abuse, and the film really ties things together as if there were a relation. I do not believe that. It is true that priests were never exemplary in chastity, but it is also true that this has been a rule imposed on the clergy for over a thousand years and any seminarian knows that he will have to comply with it or, at least, be discreet when he breaks it. The Church does not expel priests who fall into temptation with a woman, but invites them to think about what they want and demands that they assume their responsibilities. We are all sinners, but what the Church requires is consistency and honesty. As for child abuse... there is no justification for what is unjustified. Evil can be forgiven, never justified. To justify evil is to give it a basis for making it less bad. Justifying child abuse with celibacy implies thinking that this will end if the priests get married. But there are a lot of married men who abuse children, even within their families. The truth is simple: there are people who have wrong or criminal sexual instincts and inclinations, and some of these people have sought refuge in the Church. But it has never been the only or the main escape for people like that, and they will continue to exist with or without a celibate clergy.

The film has an excellent cast where I would highlight, for the quality of the work done, the names of Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAddams and Liev Schreiber, which brought the investigative journalists of Spotlight magazine to the Boston Globe. Another actor I liked to see here was Stanley Tucci, in the role of a lawyer who worked with the accused priests.

The film took very good advantage of the original material and the real facts on which it is based, and creates a wonderful story by the way it follows the efforts of journalists to discover more and more about the abuse of minors and the position of the local cardinal. The pace, which is deliberately slow, allows it to build gradually without losing the thread of the story. The absence of great effects, a showy cinematography or an overly incisive soundtrack allows us to focus on the story and the work of the cast. And that was a conscious and intelligent option of the production, which knew how to have at hand what was necessary to build an excellent film, dispensing with the stylistic artifices and giving almost a documentary note to a film that is largely fictional."

16,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spotlight/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,BrunoVn00,"May 30, 2020",8,"So, not gonna lie, I liked this movie. I think the acting is great (I loved Mark Ruffalo in this, he's hilarious). I think it's well shot. The story is interesting and I don't feel there was something missing or something that could've been cut. The dialogue is compelling. When the movie is quiet it doesn't get boring, it's actually interesting and every character interaction is believable. However, something I didn't really like are the characters. This movie has too much characters and it's so hard to keep up with all of them and their names. I hardly remember the characters because they are not really characters but more like plot devices with the sole purpose of moving the story forward. I only remember Mike (Mark Ruffalo's character) because he was pretty charming and quirky and the times I laughed in this film were because of him. The rest of the characters literally act the exact same. I don't know, I would've liked to focus on one character and its journey. It's better to flesh out one character, than having a huge cast of underdeveloped characters.

It's still a good film, but nothing great or exceptional. It didn't deserve Best Picture, tbh."

Sure, ""Spotlight"" may lack the directorial panache and flair that other, admittedly more complete films would possess, but I'll be damned if the subject matter at hand doesn't elevate everything in play. I don't need this to be flashy or expressive. The message and story at hand do it all for me. And what a story it is, scripted beautifully by Josh Singer and director Tom McCarthy, featuring stellar dialogue, brilliantly vibrant scene dynamics, and -- again -- a call to action that'll knock you on your back. ""Spotlight"" shocked me in nearly every way imaginable. Not only is it a well-deserved candidate for the best movie of 2015, it's a well-deserved candidate for being one of the best movies of its kind."

A direção é mecânica, pois ela precisa ser; seria injusto colocar planos e enquadramentos mirabolantes que nos tirasse um pouco dos dialogos, da investigação e das interpretações. Algo que pode passar despercebido, mas que é um ponto muito importante do filme é a edição: quando o filme precisa dar um salto no tempo, ela entra em ação e é simplesmente incrível. Spotlight é um filme excepcional, que trata de um assunto delicado mas sem apontar o dedo para a fé, apenas para a institucionalização da mesma. Mereceu o Oscar de Melhor Filme."

27,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spotlight/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Wigglejig,"Jul 3, 2018",7,"Spotlight is a good movie with an excellent story. It blends together the drama of a newsroom story with the intrigue of a investigative detective flick. It had excellent timing, with details of the plot unfolding just as fast as a viewer could want. The movie blended excellent dialogue between characters, as well as emotional moments only accompanied with music, depicting the silent understanding of what the city of Boston knew about these crimes. The parts in the movies were very well acted, with Ruffalo and McAdams doing a wonderful job showing their fear and anger towards the accused.        The things I did not like about this movie were the “blah” use of color and symbolism. Even though docudramas do not require artistic color use and symbolism I felt that a movie about the Catholic Church (a group full of symbolism) could have used a splash. The only other real problem I had with the movie was the lack of fear and urgency I felt with the investigation, this movie would have been an excellent documentary, but as a docudrama the drama falls a tad bit flat. I was not worried about the characters, I did not, for a second, think the “villains” had the upper hand, and I certainly was not worried about the Catholic Church retaliating, I was more worried about rival newspapers getting to the story first.
	The film is certainly worth the watch, the plot is very attractive, and the subject matter is important, timeless, and dark. The dialogue was good, emotionally charged, and powerful, with the crescendo of Ruffalo's “And people know about it.” The flaws that the film has are merely in presentation and suspense, but it should be noted that it was not written as a suspenseful thriller, but a docudrama."

34,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spotlight/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Domgwy,"Dec 20, 2017",9,"When discussing any ‘true story’ media it often becomes very difficult to seperate the telling of the story from the facts themselves.

The lasting impression of Spotlight is not the visuals, the performances or even the writing, it is the truth upon which the film is based. Much like the outstanding documentary series Making a Murderer, Spotlight draws you in with the narrative of what happened and how it happened allowing the facts to speak for themselves.

The film tackles the challenging story of the Catholic Church abuse crisis that was brought to public attention in January 2002. The title refers to the investigative team of the Boston Globe who uncovered an astonishing history of abuse and negligence within the city of Boston and it’s institutions.

Played by Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachael McAdams and Brian d’Arcy James, the team takes on the story after a new editor is appointed to the paper in the form of Liev Schreiber’s Marty Baron.

From there the story unfolds through a series of powerful, yet underplayed scenes between the journalists, the lawyers and the victims involved in the case. Each member of the team has some personal connection to the story. As Bostonians born and raised they all have their own experiences with the Catholic Church and often have to face uncomfortable truths in their search for the facts.

If I was to delve into the case (or cases) themselves I would be here all day. To reduce the story to the numbers of priests or victims would be a disservice to those involved. These are not numbers on a page, these are people who’s faith was taken away from them in the worst possible way.

There is a distinct lack of Hollywood ego on display here. From writer-director Tom McCarthy to the outstanding ensemble cast, no one is in it for themselves. Despite the film’s undeniable awards potential, it feels like it has been made for the right reasons. A lesser film-maker would have distorted the facts, framing one particular journalist as a crusading hero and creating a vehicle for a ‘Best Actor’ Oscar bid.

One of the most commendable aspects of McCarthys script is it’s refusal to shrink away from the hard truths. In this case, there are no innocent parties, as Stanley Tucci’s Michael Garabedian puts it ‘If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse them.’ The writer-director confronts this concept head on and allows the Boston Globe themselves to share some of the blame. As evidence comes to light it becomes clear that something could have been done sooner by the paper, and this revelation is not easily dismissed as something a former employee may have overlooked.

Above all Spotlight gives a real sense of conviction in the film-making. From the on screen performances from Ruffolo, McAdams and Keaton it is clear that the actors feel just as passionately about the source material as the writers they are portraying. That is perhaps the greatest praise I could level at the cast as a whole, often you forget you are even watching actors playing parts, simply a group of journalists trying to do the best job they can.

The truth behind Spotlight is something that needs to be shared as much as possible. If, in 2016, the best way to spread this story is through an Oscar-worthy docudrama filled with big name actors, then so be it. Everyone should be aware of what happened, not to vilify the Catholic Church or to spark anger, but simply so that people understand the importance of community in an increasingly individual world. If everyone looks the other way, we may yet see another great institutional injustice in our time."
35,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spotlight/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Tss5078,"Dec 13, 2017",10,"The truth is always stranger than fiction and that's why it makes for the best movies. Spotlight is the 2016 Academy Award Winner for Best Picture and it was well deserved. This star studded cast comes together to tell the true story of how the Boston Globe was finally able to breakthrough the decades long wall of silence, and expose the Catholic Church's child molestation scandal. Michael Keaton headlines this all-star cast and shows that while he's been out of the spotlight (pun intended) for some time now, he hasn't lost a beat. As the enigmatic leader of the newspaper's Spotlight section, Walter Robinson (Keaton) will not give up the fight for the truth, no matter the personal cost. Even when his own bosses tell him the story is dead and to give up, he refuses to let it go and he shows that one man with a mission really can change the world. This film doesn't simply shine a light on the Catholic Church in a way it would rather nobody ever had, but it also gives views an in depth, inside look at all the intricacies that go into investigative journalism. With all the reports of fake news and all of us who simply get our news from staring at a screen, it's hard to think about all the effort that goes into getting that information from real life to print and I personally found the process fascinating. This film has a lot going for it, from an inside look at a long forgotten industry to the mysteries behind a long hidden secret. It features some terrific writing and more than one outstanding performance. You don't get six Oscar nominations by accident.

40,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spotlight/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,juliankennedy23,"Mar 27, 2017",9,"Spotlight ( 9 out of 10)  Everyone has pet peeves when it comes to movies. We hate romantic comedies based entirely on misunderstandings, we hate horror films where no one's cell phone works,  or we simply hate movies that have either the word Adam or Sandler on the poster.

I hate true story movies that simply make things up. You know the type. We need a bad guy so let's take a real person and turn him into a racist (Hidden Figures), a murderer (Titanic), or a woman (Patch Adams). We need to condense the timeline and change real historical events (Oscar-nominated Hidden Figures again). We need to change the character's sexuality so modern audiences can relate (The Danish Girl). We need facist slaveholders to talk about democracy and freedom (300). And the list goes on and on. This is without even mentioning Mel Gibson historical dramas that might as well have dinosaurs wandering through them.

One of my other pet peeves? Movies that take place in an office or business world made by people who clearly have never spent more than a day working in one. Like ahistorical true stories, this is ripe territory for rage. We have the office politics of Catwoman’s evil beauty cream manufacturer. Not to be outdone the less said about how Wayne Industries is run ( a publicly traded company mind you) in the Batman universe the better. It isn’t just superhero movies either. Romantic comedies often need a trip to HR and no making everyone an architect does not solve that. (Seriously do these movies even know what architects or museum directors or magazine publishers actually do during their work day?)

Spotlight easily could have fallen into both these traps. It simply doesn’t. The timeline is correct. The discussions between professionals sound well professional. There are no made up heavy’s to create drama, no fake romantic love interest, no surprise terrorist attack. Okay, it does have the last one but in all fairness, the movie’s timeline starts in August 2001 and runs through the end of the year.

The scenes feel like you're really with the journalists, and you're slowly given new information about the story just as the journalists are over time.

If there's anything bad about the movie, it would have to be the score. The score is just BAD. It probably takes half the tension out of each scene it plays in.

Rather than create a melodramatic film with punchy moments, McCarthy opts to go for realism; the Boston Globe  journalists investigate and respond as they would have done in real life. This may not sound particularly spectacular, but it makes for fascinating, immersive filmmaking.
The entire cast are individually perfect (and as an ensemble), but it is definitely Ruffalo who shines the most, adapting his voice and mannerisms ever so subtly to portray Michael Rezendes. When the cast receive credit, it isn't just the lead A-listers; right down to the small supporting roles are fleshed-out characters played with dignity. Even relative unknowns with only a handful of scenes have the ability to strike you right in the feelings as much as Keaton or McAdams.
The reason 'Spotlight' is essential viewing isn't just because of the methodical script, foreboding score or bleak cinematography. The technical achievement could be praised all day. The things it has to say about abuse is vital, and this film turns statistics and lists of locations into shocking reveals that will make your skin crawl."

Spotlight is the true-story behind the 2002 expose into the Catholic Church's cover-up of decades of sexual abuse and it is unflinching in its focus and animated by its outrage, which is the best and worst part of this awards-caliber movie. Spotlight is a terrifically scripted and performed journal thriller. The actors never seem like they want to overshadow the other, but instead all work towards the common goal of the film's story.
Mark Ruffalo is great while Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams are decent. The cineomatography is smooth and the editing is tight. The screenplay is terrific and delivers an accurate representation of journalism. However the movie just feels so empty and simplistic. Stanley Tucci and Liev Schreiber are really good in the small amount of screen time they get. Overall while Spotlight is good but it isn't really anything special and failed to give the characters much depth. Not one character in the film apart from Mark Ruffalo's has any development or motivation to do what they do. The whole thing just feels shallow and completely forgettable.

La película gira en torno a un grupo periodístico de investigación que se ve beneficiado por un cambio directivo para tratar un tema muy delicado como es el abuso infantil por parte de los párrocos de la iglesia, y del sistema que manejan las entidades para ocultar dichos casos.
Al momento de explicar el problema y exhibir a los afectados es donde tiene éxito ""Spotlight"", los relatos y experiencias son muy genuinos y evidencian en forma clara cuáles son los problemas, las causas y la falta de acción del Estado para detener el dilema.
La película es altamente muy recomendable, te permite descubrir una nueva perspectiva de un caso conocido y de paso homenajea a un grupo de personas que trabajaron y se arriesgaron para hacer público un gran problema que una fuerte entidad trata de ocultar.

Would it appear like a narrative, the album in visual from start to finish? It's a bit of both, and more... deeply moving, haunting, and beautifully affecting in its portraiture of the artists on which it focuses, ""One More Time With Feeling"" does precisely what it sets out to do: renders a thousand interviews and questions moot, and gives the world as much insight as Cave and his wife are willing to share--and that, it turns out,  is perhaps a mercy to us, for what they do say is staggering in its honesty. We could talk about aesthetics (the film is gorgeous, the black-and-white 3-D experience hypnotizes and lends weight and immediacy to the interview portions--and makes the musical performances soar) but at core this is a document of process and people, who are also very much in process themselves. How rare, and how rich for us, the fans and listeners, to have such access to these amazing folks, even in their sorrow. A friend and I braved torrential rains and flashing skies, arriving at the theater thoroughly soaked--yet the experience was well worth it, and I know I will be revisiting Cave's words (and this director's vision) for a long time. I heard a rumor there were extra showings being planned in the following days, and I hope it's true--should the opportunity arise, I strongly recommend viewing this film in its intended format.

69,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-florida-project/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DawdlingPoet,"Nov 27, 2021",7,"This is a film about kids being (somewhat) on the fringe or outskirts of society, of making the most of what can be had to hand. Its brightly coloured and it could be thought provoking, although the loud racket made by the young kids did become more than a little tiresome after a while, I admit.

Some scenes are somewhat poignant but the overall sense of the kids being on the fringe of society, as I say, was quite a strong theme and I thought the film did reasonably well at portraying the frustration felt by a parent seemingly stuck in a rut as well. However, the attitude the mother displays and, as I say, the childs in your face attitude was rather wearing. I don't think this is a film that will really appeal to all (not that many do, I suppose) but I didn't dislike its quirkiness and the sort of loud and brash nature it has, contrasted with the setting being very close to an expensive Disney theme park (of course). There are ironies at play here and probably my favourite aspect of this film is the bright colours (visually) with the motel their staying at having bright pink walls and brightly coloured shops and cafes etc. nearby.

Overall, to me this was a reasonably ok film, somewhat decent but certainly not great, in my book, however I can understand why other people may be more keen on it. If it sounds particularly interesting to you, then yes, I'd recommend it but it won't suit (or appeal to) everyone, I imagine."
70,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-florida-project/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,NobodyYouKnow,"Nov 1, 2020",9,"Your reaction to this film will rely largely on two things:
1) Your expectations. 2) Your patience. This movie does not follow Hollywood conventions, so if you want the standard Hollywood storytelling approach, you won't like this. And related to that is the fact that the first half of the film plays like a documentary and, hence, doesn't have a clear narrative arc. What you see is the life of a young mother and daughter and the people in their immediate orbit living at/below the poverty line. The realism achieved is truly remarkable, especially the way the children spend their time -- like all kids, they only know their own extremely limited experience, and they figure out how to have fun without showing any signs of deprivation. Despite the mother's limited ability to provide for her daughter, we never see signs of her love for her daughter faltering, even when her situation becomes dire.

If you're patient and just accept the slow pace of the first half, you'll reap the rewards of that patience. Just let the remarkably realistic performances wash over you. The kids are fantastic, but I also give kudos to director Sean Baker for eliciting these utterly natural/realistic performances from all the kids -- I'd guess that Baker filmed many hours of the children playing without strict direction in order to capture the way kids play in real life. I don't believe I've ever seen a more natural, believable performance from a child than I saw from Brooklynn Prince (Monee).

It all feels very slice-of-life until a pivotal event about 3/4 through the movie involving the mother and another mother in the motel. The consequences of that event unfold in an equally realistic fashion, and the drama heightens, but still in a very realistic, non-sensational way. I won't say what happens, but in a scene when authorities become involved, I eventually was moved to tears. At the end of the movie, I realized that my strong reaction was largely due to the investment of time in the movie's first half -- I felt that I had experienced a great deal of the protagonists' real lives, and when their lives became disrupted, I felt the heartbreaking effects of that investment.

Some will feel cheated by the ending of the movie, but I thought it was just right. Again, this film doesn't adhere to the standard Hollywood approach, and as such, it doesn't hand you a clear-cut, tied-in-a-bow ending. But this movie never tries to be a feel-good flick -- it's showing you the reality experienced by a portion of the US who is barely mentioned/acknowledged in pop culture. Again, your expectations matter here. Know that the ending is a metaphor for the feelings/desires of Monee who is reacting to the news of what feels like a traumatic life change. If you're open to this kind of ending, just make sure to have tissues ready."

School, in comparison to their home lives, was an orderly, safe, predictable environment in which adults could be counted on to act responsibly and even protectively.  School was a refuge from the chaos encompassing their homes and neighborhoods.

The children depicted in The Florida Project find joy and adventure while growing up in an environment in which they see and hear things that are age-inappropriate to the extreme.  The innocence of their childhoods is continually polluted by the dysfunction of the adults who are supposed to be raising them.

The movie tells a disturbing, compelling story of an underclass of people who live day-to-day in budget motels raising the rent to stay in their rooms by whatever means necessary.  Although the story could be quite depressing, the movie maintains a certain energy and optimism by focusing primarily on the children, who find ways to entertain themselves and enjoy their lives despite the chaos surrounding them.

The movie is honest.  It does not sugarcoat.  It reveals and teaches, but it does not preach.  It does not presume to prescribe solutions.  It does not have a plot in the traditional sense of the word.  It has a bit of a ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" vibe to it.  Kids having fun interacting with each other, with their environment, and with the adults they often annoy in the process.

The cast contained only one ""big name"" actor.  Several actors--including 6-year-old Brooklyn--had no previous experience whatsoever.  The acting nevertheless was top notch.  The film seemed well produced and directed.

92,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-florida-project/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Kaustav,"Feb 3, 2018",9,"This movie is hauntingly real, the actors too real almost, their stories hurt in a way that i s hard to forget - perhaps because we, as the viewers with probably better situations are the ones who are to able to realize what these people can't have and what these simple, sweet, children are getting twisted and torn away from their chance at happiness of childhood.
It would be unfair to say that they are orphans and are dying of hunger or not being helped at all. No, they have some form of family and even friendly hands reach out from time to time, but its not enough. It's never enough to give such troubled people to get out of their vicious cycle. More importantly though, this story is about telling that there are such people and they are living, in their own way. Do not pity them, but if anything help them out with some bucks and a job if you can. Lastly, it is not where you should come looking for solutions for there is ample evidence for a lot of people it is just another way of life they can't get out or want to, for almost the same reasons as any other person from some other lifestyle - after this while, maybe it just seems easier than stepping out of the box.
Special and obvious mention to the Child Actor who plays Moni and her relationship with her mother, whose portrayal as the slummy white single mother is very well done. While Willem Dafoe is too much of esoteric iconoclast to even be pointed out for his subtle acting, all the additional child actors and supporting cast really bring the whole of The Florida Project seem excruciatingly original to the viewer. The sound and general editing does well to avoid any jarring realisation between the scene changes even though there a quite few contrasts in changing.
To sum up, You should watch this movie for its excellent acting, casting, story, direction and editing among all else I forgot to single out. But here's why You must watch the movie - It will remind to be kind and contemplative in your compassion on those low days when your mind can't help be a frog in the well."

The Florida Project

I suppose it is difficult for anyone to talk about this movie and not use the word, ""beautiful"" in it for you cannot not fall in love with all the clips of these little kids playing all on their own whispering innocence on the screen. The Florida Project is a kind of movie that has an amazing premise and beautiful script along with it which comes off as a magic on screen but it also is kind of a movie that if not taken care of while executing it, it may come off dull and boring. And Sean Baker is ready to take all the responsibility for it and he carries it all around on his shoulder shooting and editing some of the most precious moments on the screen (it may remind you of those little clips that were shown in American Beauty; remember the guy that used to shoot any clips who lived across Kevin Spacey). The lead child actress is amazing in it and supporting her all through the course of the movie is Willem Dafoe who easily resembles to any man in charge of the responsibilities; he is simply brilliant in it. The Florida Project carries off these little sequences building it upto something more than one can imagine and flaunts it all over the screen like a magician."

The film makes use of some kick-ass cinematography (colorful imagery of the summer, and a picture that reflects childhood innocence), while the story sheds light on poverty, and the bad things that come along with it, and how it affects childhood, and for me, that is what pop culture nowadays would describe as ""woke"", because not a lot of films these days shed light on those important issues. The performances of the children are so good (annoying at first, though) that they feel almost totally natural, and Willem Dafoe's attempt at portraying a fatherly figure proves to be successful by all means. However, the film lacks a solid and straight-to-the-point conclusion, and instead gets glued to a vague ending that would make the writers look like they ran out of good-enough ideas. To sum it up, 'The Florida Project' is a good film, but it may not be meant for everybody."

Though Brooklynn Prince gives a charming performance, the real star of the film was Willem Dafoe for me, he is absolutely fantastic.

The Florida Project is pretty much an observation, an observation surprisingly affective and effective of one side of American society that rarely receives attention and if it does, it's usually full of stereotypes.

The Florida Project is a poignant and straightforward drama but not gratuitous at all, it does not force anything, it just let things happen and that effort achieves an incredibly solid and moving result. Another great movie by A24."

Her spunky personality drives the lively exploits of her small group of friends, as they pass the days inside and outside a cheap, seedy Orlando motel. Bria Vinaite is another off-the-street casting who is interesting as her messed-up mother. There is known actor: Willem Dafoe, who plays the befuddled manager, balancing his business responsibilities with his heartfelt concern for the residents.

""I can always tell when adults are about to cry"".

""The Florida Project"" is a bright candy-lit look on Florida lifestyle, which has it's dark moments underneath. The beautiful, but trashy Disney parody is presented from a little girls point of view. Every serious or traumatic event are completely overshadowed by a child; we only see it in the background. To be honest, a lot of the scenes in the film reminded me of ""Moonlight"". Little details that added to the similarities, but different in execution.

I haven't seen Sean Baker's ""Tangerine "", so this is my first film from him and I gotta tell ya, it's a great start. While Baker directing isn't anything I could call a true master or anything, but the way directs certain scenes, even the ridiculous ones brings such life to the film. Mixed with the amazing cinematography is pure magic.

The performances from everyone and several of the kid actors were all fantastic. A breakout role for Bria Vinaite and a impressive one from Brooklynn Prince, who carries the film. The camera is locked onto her through out. You never lose your focus, which alone is an accomplishment. This is best I've seen from Willem Dafoe. A restrain and moving performance that every time he leaves the screen, you miss him.

My only issues with the film is sound editing. Some sound didn't match up or was delayed after it's action, such as fireworks. Then there's the ending which was so bad and out of place with the rest of movie, stopping it from being a perfect movie for me. The quality of being shot on a phone just looked sloppy compared to the rest of the film. It's like they didn't know how to end it.

Putting complaints aside, this is still a phenomenal character study. Striking an emotional core with me. One of finest movies of 2017."

The acting was great, the story was compelling. The brilliance and point of the story is the idea of a child trying to live a ""normal"" childhood in the midst of a terrifying situation. Her mother is negligent, she is in danger from many different things in her environment in the backdrop of the happiest place on earth. The film is about innocence in the face of adversity."

I hated the main character (Moonie) at first but grew to understand her and then feel sympathetic for her. Another reviewer complained that there is no ending, so if you're looking for something that ties up nicely in the end then this isn't for you. I found the ending to be quite endearing."

Her mother is on the verge of poverty, constantly struggling just to keep up with the rent. Directed by Sean Baker and starring Brooklynn Prince, Bria Vinaite and Willem Dafoe.

The harsh reality of life seen through the eyes of children. It's innocent, funny and sad all at the same time. You almost forget this is a movie, the child actors don't seem to be acting at all. Each and every interaction seems natural and believable. You're quickly brought into this story, laughing one minute and near tears the next. Although there's no clear lines between the beginning, middle and end. It moves in one smooth motion, giving you a glimpse into the life of Moonee and her friends. Without giving anything away I personally found the ending to be somewhat disappointing. The majority of the film doesn't shy away from the difficult lives these people are living so the ending seemed out of place. That aside it's heart breaking and has no problem provoking intense emotions from the audience. Truly incredible acting and one of the most immersive movies I have ever seen. You won't see a film quite like The Florida Project very often. Not to be missed and highly recommended."

Brilliantly written and incredibly emotional, Timbuktu is incredibly well-directed and its heartbreaking story will resonate with everybody, no matter your stance on the Middle East and the issues surrounding it. By all measures, Timbuktu is an astonishing achievement from director Abderrahmane Sissako that does a great job of putting a face to the people of these oft-forgotten nations. As it often brought up in the film, you must realize these are people with children, just like people here. These kids are the center of their worlds and though their surroundings can be crazy at times, the people there are truly victims of the situation and deserve to be seen as such. Overall, Timbuktu is an impeccable well-made film that also really stirs you up emotionally and the end result is a fantastic piece of cinema."

East” and more specifically the traditional Muslim faith confronted by the new more radicalized and controlling Islam using their interpretation of “Jihad” as a sword.

The heart of the film is the main family dynamic torn apart by oppressive fanatics, as are all the other observant but moderate Muslim families we see, but the soul of ‘Timbuktu’ is best represented by the dialogue involving the local Imam questioning one of the foreign invading “Jihadist’s” piety and if he truly thinks God & their faith are being served by punishing devout Muslims whose only crimes are playing music and refusing to make women wear gloves and socks.

The pace of the film may not be to everyone’s liking, it’s slow and deliberate, and if you expect to see a Westernized graphic representation of “Terrorism” then expect to be disappointed, ‘Timbuktu’ dares to represent “Jihadists” as more than fanatical terrorist instead depicting them as human, flawed and even naive.

The Bottom Line…
Bold, timely, narrowly focused but with potentially global scope, ‘Timbuktu’ is a little gem of a foreign film that you’ll rather disturbingly connect to wherever you’re from and won’t regret catching if you give it a chance."

This very deserving Oscar nominee for best foreign language film exposes a cynical, hypocritical, bullying power structure for what it really is -- and why it desperately needs to be removed from control. This isn't the easiest picture to watch at times, but it makes its statement in an undeniably clear way, one that, one would hope, inspires reformers to step to the forefront to bring about much-needed change."

Может из-за потрясающей актёрской игры главных актрис, может из-за напирающей на реализм съёмки, но все два часа мне было крайне интересно чем всё закончится, хотя в фильме, по большому счёту не происходило ничего. Момент же, когда во второй половине фильма героиня проходит психологический тест (на который надо ответить одним из вариантов ""никогда / редко / иногда / всегда"") и из её эмоций при ответах мы понимаем что же именно произошло, просто гениальный.

I found it eye-opening for sure, and the lead performance was deeply impactful and devastating at times. I don't understand the cancel mentality people have on this site. There's a 0-10 scale for a reason. I would also hazard a guess that at the very least 60% of the negative reviews are from users who never watched the film.

Apparently a lot of people on both sides of the issue found this movie pro-abortion. That wasn't my take-away at all. While I'm fairly certain the director is pro-abortion, the film didn't come across as a political statement. It was respectful.

It is inevitably political, an accurate reflection of the society, the moral and ethical values that surround it that it’s relatively difficult to tackle especially if it involves young women and their power against the opinions and stigma that coincide it.

Never Rarely Sometimes Always is a sad depiction of this reality. There’s not a light scene nor a hint of optimism and hopefulness in this excellent drama. Not overseeing the controversy of the subject matter, Never subtly shows the inner turmoil of Autumn, how she reacts toward everything that’s happening around her. How she could appear callous with the propensity to self detach, and only knows despondence as her cousin Skylar and their companionship act as the beating heart of this forlorn film. A particular scene where she’s being questioned by an adviser before undergoing the procedure just took the film to its sad, emotional heights.

Though there are striking similarities in theme between Never and the Romanian art film 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days; Never Rarely Sometimes Always feels as present as today which further proves that women in this modern era are still as oppressed when it comes to their autonomy. With great directorial and writing, and really impressive performance from its characters, Never Rarely Sometimes Always is probably the first great drama of 2020."

164,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/never-rarely-sometimes-always/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,JLuis_001,"Apr 8, 2020",7,"In essence, the story of Never Rarely Sometimes Always has nothing complicated to explain. It's a story about teen pregnancy and abortion but if you might tell it to someone else that way you would be selling it too cheaply.

Autumn (Sidney Flanigan) the protagonist is in need of an abortion but the laws of her state require parental permission to execute it.
Unable to work out the situation by herself, she and her cousin - who discovers her secret - decide to embark to New York to carry out the procedure.

The outstanding resources of this film lies in the solid performance of its lead actress and the great work the director does by not allowing a story that could be easily lent to melodrama, to fall into it.

The story never tries to make Autumn's experience something more than what it is and that's essential because that keeps the story rooted where it needs to be.
And although the experience can be replicated and as a viewer and person you fully understand that this occurr to countless many young women; Never Rarely Sometimes Always is Autumn's experience and both the director and the main character give a strong voice to the subject and deliver a raw but revealing film.

The negative element? The victimization of its protagonist.
As I said, melodrama is avoided but despite the pro-abortion message, the director can't help but portray Autumn as an innocent and tormented young woman unable to fully weigh her situation or to think it more through.

I cannot deny the experience is traumatic for young women, but I suppose the film should also try to give the message that it's not the end of the world, even understanding the situations that overwhelm the character, such as the sequence that it provides the title to the film.
That's the reason why I didn't give it an 8."

It’s made up of small moments that’s cumulative power is something pretty remarkable to behold. Eliza Hittman’s work reminds me in a lot of ways of Andrea Arnold’s films in the way it creates incredible intimate humanist portraits of fairly insular characters. She also shares a lot in common with her fellow New York compatriots the Safdies Brothers in the way she captures unglamorous but a hyper-specific vision of New York unlike that we normally see in cinema. This attention to details has always been a hallmark of her works but there’s something specifically in this film that makes the world feel so real - little touches like hot sauce packets in a family junk drawer, the feel and atmosphere of being adrift in a city with nowhere to stay, the way a manager tends to speak at a dead-end retail job. Everything in the world of her film feels so lived in. The film tackles the topic of abortion and does so in the least melodramatic way possible, the film rather than announcing it’s thesis just simply takes you through the process and the maddening levels of bureaucracy put in place to keep women from being able to simply make a choice about their bodies. In the midst of all this though it also has a very human story and real friendship and that’s anchored by two incredible performances. Talia Ryder already feels like a star in this film and has such a softness and warmth that you can already see why Spielberg would be casting her in his work. The standout though obviously is Sidney Flanigan. The entire film rests on her shoulders and there’s very few frames she’s not at the direct center of. The character of Autumn requires such control and nuance given how quiet she is. Flanigan keeps this from ever feeling like a passive character though, so much is communicated in just the way she physically responds and so much of her strength comes in the way in which we see her just barely holding on but managing to. It’s an incredibly challenging role to take on and Sidney Flanigan not only rises to the challenge but provides Autumn such a distinct identity. I also don’t wanna go all Sean Baker here, but I love that Eliza Hittman always shoots on film and the cinematography here is absolutely gorgeous.

We've seen it before, the toxic relationship that is always one-sided and we as witnesses scream ""run girl!,"" but usuallybits far more dramatic. The Souvenir shows us how these toxic people, driven by narcissism, lust, and greed, can still endeat themselves to supposedly sane and intelligent people. Theres slow growth here that isn't your typical, Hollywood ending where the hero/heroine makes it through tragedy and struggle to a brighter, sunny day. Instead the pay-off is the sobering reality that life simply ambles forward and it is up to us to make sense and peace of it."

It is a romantic drama, that tells the story of a couple: The woman (played by Honor Swinton) is an aspiring filmmaker and the boyfriend (played by Tom Burke) is a mysterious drugaddict. I wasn't expecting some subject matters in this movie and they were handled in a realistic and shocking way. The movie is very well-written, but its strongest point by far is its performances. Honor Swinton's acting is just wonderful, so was Tom Burke's acting too. These actors really give realism and depth to their characters through their performances. This is one of the best acted films I have seen in the year so far. The directing and cinematography, while both good, could've been better.

Overall this is an amazing character study film. Don't expect like an exciting plot because this movie has no plot. You will be left with nothing but great dialogue and terrific performances."
170,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-souvenir/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,amheretojudge,"Jul 26, 2019",8,"Walking into the film is like entering a well documented room that is screaming for attention and regretting.

The Souvenir

Hogg is a reserved person in here. The persona of the writer-director, Joanna Hogg factors incredibly in a film so personal as such. And I don't mean just that it is derived from some real experience, but that it deals with something so personal for the characters too, that it doesn't, they don't even let you in. You remain a part of an audience throughout this journey. And on a larger scale, this might act as a double edged sword as not everyone would respond to such a formal invitation- if there is any. But the art form remains a mystery to be solved. And what the film made me feel makes me not to understand but just remember it. This is one of those experiences that will stay with you.

And the reason behind it, is Hogg's deeply religious virtue on deconstructing the romanticized version of itself. First, I thought she has unromanticized the genre by never agreeing to anything which happens to be the theme. No character, no surroundings, no situation, no philosophy, nothing seems to agree. Not even my favourite part of the narration that is the musical sequences that every now and then pops up, just like Julie's (Honor Swinton Byrne) reads. I never felt the love between the lead couple despite an excellent performance.

If anything, their equation seemed a dry rough patch persisting to heal as each of them tries to stay in one room and just be present. No spark just a warm soothing feeling that could actually be any relationship and not particularly just a romantic one. For a world so sane and sensible, Hogg flipped the coming-of-age genre through new lenses marking the first creatively fresh film I saw claiming this genre. The Souvenir speaks most of the time through the physicality present in nature, she says, she cries, she reads, should be accounted in for theatricality."

There's really not a whole lot for me to say on this one unfortunately. I wanted to like it more, as many have been deeming this small and quiet little film a masterpiece, but that was it's problem. It was almost TOO quiet and subtle for my liking, almost to the point of being not very memorable at all. On the plus side however, it's beautifully shot, and the performances are brilliant. Tilda Swinton plays a small role in this, with her daughter Honor Swinton Byrne playing the lead role of the film student in this, and she's got some great emotional and acting chops!

It's beautifully acted and beautifully shot, but more realistic and with more of an edge and a more contemporary theme. The louche Anthony (brilliantly acted by David Burke) is “cool” and self-possessed, but also hopelessly lost. He flirts with and tempts Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne), and perhaps because of her family ties and a stronger sense of self, she manages to resist his frailties.

Oppenheimer gives the narrative a more personal touch by focusing on a single family and the effect of losing their brother in such a senseless and brutal manner, the legacy of the killings you might expect would have the same harrowing effect on hundreds of thousands of families and the country as a whole, hence the title whereby families continue to suffer in silence with many of the perpetrators still in power and apparently untouchable.

With a lack of almost any archival footage or photographic evidence 'The Look of Silence' relies on the testimonies of victims and their families and the disturbingly candid & borderline **** descriptions from the perpetrators for dramatic content, depending on your point of view this might make it a more or less powerful film but given that there is no way to independently confirm what happened between 1965-66 it might make the whole documentary somewhat controversial.

The Bottom Line...
A powerful and personalized account of one of the more overlooked genocides in recent history,  'The Look of Silence' is a stark warning against stoking the fires of political & religious hatred and most effective when accompanying Oppneheimer's 2012 documentary 'The Act of Killing'."

This stands out from many documentaries because it presents the events in a very stylized way. If you somehow think that rotoscoping is a lazy way of doing animation, I'm sorry to tell you that you are wrong, because rotoscoping is actually very hard and time consuming. It is nice to see this documentary benefit from the animation to give the audience a different visual experience. As a documentary, it does a really good job in making the audience connect with the people affected by this tragedy. Like someone else said in this site: ""It focuses more on the humanity and less in the killer"" and I agree.

My only issue with the movie is that there isn't too much animation in the second half of the movie. When the movie gets closer to the end it starts using more live action footage of the actual people interviewed and also starts to reuse animated footage and we don't get that many unique animated scenes. It's a very short movie and, while I don't want to call the movie ""Lazy"" because it definitely isn't, I felt that it was kinda of a letdown that I started to see less and less unique animated sequences.

184,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/tower/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"May 26, 2017",8,"About the first such incident in the US history.

It was like another documentary film that I saw one last week. But this time it was an even bigger scale. This, the original event took place exactly 50 years ago and first of its kind. Since then hundreds of similar events have been recorded. Many of them were made into films, but I don't remember this one was ever turned into one. This is about a raged gunman on the college campus, where many people got killed and injured. A shocking incident, even cops did not know how to handle it at first.

So, the film reveals one of the most horrific episodes ever happened in the American soil. Like everything has a first time, this is where it all began for this kind of event. The filmmakers used some of the original archive footage to tell the story, but the majority of the film was the animation. Since it was a documentary film and was made under a tight budget, the visuals were not that pleasant, but the notion was well achieved.

Documentary films and interviews are like thunder and lightening. So there are interviews in it, but most of them were made-up of. I mean they were real, though not with the real people, except their recorded voice interviews in most of the cases. It was challenging to bring back the original event on the screen since it is not a feature film to recreate whatever way they want, especially that occurred half a century ago. But very appreciable for even giving us this much of detail to feel the vibe.

❝One of the truths I have learnt is that there are monsters that walk among us.❞

It was like any other normal day on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin. But the scenario has suddenly changed when two student couple fell on the ground not aware of what just happened, and so the people around. After some time, it became clear that a gunman open fired on them and many others from a nearby tower, but the real issue is nobody could see him. Soon it reached the radio and television, and alert has been circulated. Then the cops got involved to solve the matter and how it all ends covered in the rest of the films.

This is a good film, revealed most of the parts as much as in details, but I'm not fully convinced. Because the concept of narration was quite similar to feature film style where they want to keep the mystery. It all begins with one perspective and multiplies as it progresses. Except not focusing enough on the negative character. I understood the situation of the event, but I did not get enough detail about the gunman. It was like one side of the story. So mysterious and it stayed that way.

Shorter and well paced. This is definitely worth checking out, though not a must see. To learn the history, the bad one. I had no idea about it prior to watch, but at the end, I felt it accomplished everything on its capacity to give out the truth. No matter it is a documentary film, along with the suspense, the tension was well balanced. So, more or less it is same as like watching a regular crime film. That's especially for those who are not into documentary films. I hope someone would make a feature film out of it.

186,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/tower/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Brent_Marchant,"Dec 20, 2016",9,"On August 1, 1966, assassin Charles J. Whitman ascended the University of Texas, Austin, observation tower and opened fire on the campus below, killing 16 and injuring 33. The horrific incident, one of the first mass shootings in modern American history, received considerable attention at the time. But the events of that day, including numerous acts of compassion and heroism, have since faded from public awareness. Those touching moments and courageous efforts have been brought back to life in “Tower,” a stylish, innovative documentary that examines the tragedy from the perspective of survivors, law enforcement and the media. Telling this story, however, required some inventive filmmaking. Given the dearth of media coverage of the incident at the time (at least compared to today’s standards), director Keith Maitland needed to compensate for a lack of archival footage by blending the limited historic images available with a compelling mixture of riveting animation and recent interviews in relating the survivors’ and heroes’ stories. The result is a moving, highly personal account of that fateful day and its legacy in the annals of American gun violence."

It is highly thought provoking and can be interpreted in several different ways. I believe part of the writer's intention is to show how one's perspective or mind can lead one to choose or make conclusions that may be completely different than someone else with a different upbringing, or mental or emotional state. After watching the film, I had one belief about what led up to the ending and then upon reading other people's theories became convinced that the movie was in fact showing the audience how their conclusions were based off small windows of their limited perspectives, not the whole picture. Very early in the movie, the female main mentions how her apartment’s lone window faces north, so her room only gets natural light for a very short time once a day. The writer leaves subtle clues within the dialogue used between the characters such as metaphors or suggestive aids to help the viewer infer events and their meaning throughout the movie. In one of the initial scenes, one of the main characters is pantomiming eating a tangerine and states the key is ""Don't think there is a tangerine here. Just forget that there isn't one. That's the key."" Many times in our lives we make assumptions based on things we see, hear, feel, or sometimes we tell ourselves stories based on these perceptions, and can get so caught up in our emotions and mind’s dialogue that we miss all of the moments in between. Sadly, many of us may make regrettable choices based on these imperfect inferences."

It's also too dubious and spaced. The film relies heavily in ambiguity and certainly challenges you to infer things but not always what is insinuated is really rewarding or satisfying when the plot isn't really direct.

Burning is a dense film, I wouldn't say complex but it does has certain deep and hidden layers that invite you to revisit it, unfortunately its slow character study and the slow narrative are not so exciting especially because I think that seeing it again would imply not to enjoy it again but to notice the things you overlooked the first time and I say that because I'm 100% sure that there were things that I didn't quite noticed

200,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/burning/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Bertaut1,"Feb 16, 2019",8,"A slow-burning mystery about economics, class, and sexual jealousy. And cats.

A thriller about a missing person. An allegory of class division. A fable about modern consumerism. A dramatisation of psychological breakdown. An analysis of socio-economic disenfranchisement. A critique of toxic masculinity and its concomitant misogyny. An extended rib on Schrodinger's cat. Beoning is all of these. And none of them. Essentially a psychological drama about three people, although it's possible that only one of those people is real. There are also two cats. Or maybe only one cat. For some, those more used to concrete black-and-white, yes-and-no narratives, the film's ambiguity will be off-putting. However, irrespective of that, director Lee Chang-dong's mastery of tone is extraordinary to witness, bestowing portentous significance upon the most inanimate of objects.

Adapted by Lee and Jungmi Oh from Haruki Murakami's 1983 short story ""Barn Burning"", which itself is loosely inspired by William Faulkner's 1939 short story, Beoning is set in contemporary South Korea, and tells the story of aspiring novelist Lee Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo), who by chance encounters Shin Hae-mi (Jong-seo Jun), who claims to have gone to school with him, although he doesn't remember. Beginning a tentative relationship, Jong-su is confused when Hae-mi returns from a trip to Africa with a new friend, the wealthy and confidant Ben (Steven Yeun). As the trio form a strange relationship, Ben tells Jong-su that he likes to burn down a greenhouse every few months. Shortly thereafter, Hae-mi disappears, and, suspecting Ben, Jong-su determines to find her. Thematically, the film covers a plethora of issues; toxic masculinity, alpha and beta males, economics and consumerism, class, the place of women in Korean society, sexual jealousy, working-class privations, faceless capitalism, writer's block, and gender politics. In relation to this last theme, one of the things that so captivates Jong-su about Hae-mi is her provocative behaviour. Yet later, when she dances topless outside his house, he is disgusted, telling Ben, ""only a **** acts like that."" It's a succinct summary of a societal double-standard. Whilst it could be argued that Hae-mi functions only to further Jong-su and Ben's arcs, devoid of any real agency herself, an alternative reading is that she is poorly sketched so as to represent a patriarchal society in which women are seen as less complex than men. However, there is also the possibility that she doesn't actually exist, and in this sense, the fact that she is so sexualised is because she is literally a male's fantasy, a sexual obsession born in the disturbed mind of an unreliable narrator. The film is told exclusively from Jong-su's perspective, everything we see is filtered through his ideological outlook. So, for example, when he sees Ben yawning as Hae-mi is dancing, the yawn becomes sinister, because that's how Jong-su interprets it. In this sense, if one theorises that Hae-mi is a figment of Jong-su's imagination, then so too must Ben, serving as the inverse to Hae-mi; a personification of everything to which Jong-su aspires, but is unable to attain.

One of the most salient motifs, if not necessarily a theme unto itself, is that of disappearance, with references scattered throughout the film - Hae-mi notes that her childhood home is gone, as is the well she fell into; Jong-su recollects how after his mother abandoned the family, his father burnt her clothes; when Ben tells Jong-su about his greenhouse hobby, he states, ""you can make it disappear as if it never even existed""; Hae-mi says she wants to disappear; when Jong-su asks Ben if it's possible Hae-mi has gone on another trip, Ben says, ""maybe she disappeared like a puff of smoke"". The most important scene in this sense is one in which Hae-mi tells Jon-su that she's learning pantomime, and proceeds to mime peeling and eating a tangerine, telling Jong-su the trick isn't to pretend the tangerine is really there, but to ""forget it doesn't exist"". This challenge to perception is crucial not just in how Jong-su becomes convinced Hae-mi has met foul play despite the lack of evidence, it also provides a clue for the audience as to how best to parse the film itself.

All in all, I found Beoning to be a haunting film, one which I couldn't get out of head for days, and I'm keen to see it again. Some will dislike the ambiguity, but Lee's masterful control of tone is extraordinary, balancing a plethora of themes within a half-social-realist/half-magic-realist milieu. As good an exercise in cinematic suggestiveness as you're likely to see, the film is such that everything on screen, every word spoken, every background detail could be important. Or not. Fiercely intelligent, deeply nuanced, complexly layered, this is the finely crafted work of a distinct and relevant auteur."

The soundtrack, too, is in perfect consonance with the film and I was amazed at how good and natural the performances were.

Steven Yeun is incredible in this. His subtle but convincing acting choices really bring life, not only to his character, but also to the entire scenes he's in. This film is definitely not what I thought it was going to be, and I'm glad it was able to surprise me.

To me, Burning is a beautiful car in flames, in the distance, slowly heading in your direction. It takes you a while to make out what it is, but when you figure it out, the car is inches from you already and you're too distracted by its flames to do something about it."

Burning

Lee's illuminating thriller lights a havoc on the drama genre. From scene one, the slow pill is the best medicine one can aspire for such a shady tale, and Lee's vision doesn't go off track, even for a split second in this more than two hours of marathon. A perfectly balanced and properly constructed film, that balances characters' perspective and the bones of the storyline on nothing but uncertainty. And it is that element of uncertainty in air, that keeps challenging us to think beyond our imaginations and the responsible driver is Lee armed with a meticulous script and brilliant execution. Probably only once they refer the word ""metaphor"" which doesn't mean anything, for besides that, it is immensely layered and a mirror of the intentions and deep dark thoughts of these characters.

One might assume that after its first half, the film would drive towards the rudimentary investigation process, but Lee has some other plans for you, he has been building up the entire film for that last trick that leaves its viewers hanging without any clue. And this is where the film gets better, after it ends, it allows you to roll back all the tell tales and innuendos that was driving towards this destination, boy what a ride it is.

Aforementioned, the entire film is dipped into metaphor, Lee is not ready to reveal his secret till the last frame, he holds on to it like his dearest, which makes us hold onto this wider range allegory, never has a tale been so fluctuating and pulsating. From the shadow of a lighthouse to a cow, from well crafted rumors to a cat, it is a buoyant absorbing tale that tests you intellectually and spiritually. And walking that fine line, resides Lee's true intentions of the tale, and as a character quotes once in the film, The Greater Hunger- the meaning of life.

Yoo, the protagonist, has pretty much a similar role to its audience, he too is trying to figure out and analyse the world around him, and fortunately he is at best at his depressive state rather than an overprotective one. Jun as the essential part of the mystery act, has plays an amazing role to cast the spell of hers enough to not let it wear off until the credits rolls. But the show stealer would always be Yeun, in his rich charismatic cloak.

With his stunning portrayal, and the substance of his characters that is most attracting than any others, his ideologies speaks much more than one anticipates. If its first act is spent upon building our protagonist, then the second one is depicting the eerie chemistry of this scary friendship, leaving us with a last act that is basically joining the dots. Hence, personally I prefer when Yeun invades Yoo and Jun's life with a big pack of gusto. Burning burns more than you would think, in fact it leaves us with only ashes for us to investigate, and to survive from that has its own sweet results."

It's also clear that the plot is a thin veil through which to take a tour of the horrors of the camp without directly dealing with them.

The World War II is the largest source supplier for the war movies. I have seen numerous breathtaking braverism, as well as heartbreakingly suffering film characters which are based on the real and sometimes fiction. The genre too differs, from action, adventure, war to the comedy, romance, drama et cetera. Since the Academy Awards nominee announcement in the January I had an eye on this, but now it had won the Oscars that draw my interest even more on this. Anyway, finally saw this, so let me tell you what I feel about it.

It is no ones biopic, but inspired by a collection of testimonies of those who had made out alive from the Auschwitz. Like some of the WWII films, it is very unique, that focused on a particular event and a person. Saul is one of the prisoners in the **** held concentration camp who is a slave-labour. His job is to clean the place after prisoners were executed. One day he finds a young boy who was executed and soon he takes the responsibility to give him a proper burial. Risking his own life and others, he begins to find a rabbi to perform the last rites. So what happens later and how it ends is the remaining film.

It is not only enthralling story, but was very clever and unique filmmaking. In this whole film you will see one face at all the time in different angles and mostly they're close shots. Yes, Saul is everywhere, the camera never takes off its lens out of him. We would experience what he sees, listening and undertaking, more like in the real time. Just like a computer game where everything is from our (player's) angle, but here it is us again barely through the Saul's perspective. (Something like the upcoming Hollywood film 'Hardcore Henry' trailer I saw.)

Although, the movies are not the games, like I felt weird during watching 'Need for Speed', when Aaron Paul was at my place. And a movie always needs a character that can take us to the journey through the time and space where it sets, otherwise it will be called a documentary film. The aspect ratio was like the older day films which is narrow that takes time for us to get used to it, yet it is a colour film. More like the entire story is taking place within the 48 hours. Interesting pace and developments, and a decent conclusion. I think it deserved all the praise and prizes given to it.

""You have forsaken the living for the dead.""

I know the seriousness of the film and its contents, but I could not avoid the laugh at the end scene. I did not want to, but I did it without my self-awareness after seeing the Saul's face. I hope, there are others too, like me in that situation. Yet the storyline was very strong, like how far would a man can go knowing the life is meaningless after what he's going through. That makes him to take a solo mission when others are struggling and working together for their freedom.

Since I don't know any language that spoken in the movie, I had no problem too to follow the movie. The 1944 settings were so realistic, I think everyone's hard-work was this film's result. All the performances were excellent, especially who played the Saul's role. That is the face no one is going to forget who had watched this film. However the real hero of the film was not the actors or the writers and the director, but the cameraman. Like I said earlier, he had done a brilliant job. If anyone wants to praise this film, he/she must begin with him. The cinematography award at the Oscars might have went to 'The Revenant', but the cameraman award is none other than this guy who shot this film.

I really liked this film, but not overly sympathised or enjoyed. Usually if any movie that's based on the real gets my favour, even the movie has been low quality with more than ignorable flaws. Because telling the truth to the world is what I consider is foremost important than trying to get benefit out of it. But when it's not factual, I expect whatever the cinematical options can make it a better product.

This film comes between them both, but leans mostly on the truth about the World War II prison camp. An insight of what the prisoners have went through. Painful to watch a movie like this, at a time I appreciate the filmmakers for giving this film and let the younger generation know a tiny dot of the incident of the WWII. To watch this film, no one needs a reason. It is automatically a must see, but after watching it, whether you liked it or not is an individual opinion.

Geza Rohrig gives a moving, quietly powerful performance as a man determined to give a dead child some dignity even when trapped by the horrors of a concentration camp. Filmed mostly up-close with hand-held cameras, director Laszlo Nemes puts viewers right in the middle of the story, allowing the audience to experience the gruesome, inhumane indignities firsthand while skillfully hinting at the horrors taking place at hand without graphically depicting many of them. The strongly visceral feeling this picture evokes is definitely not for everyone, but, for those who are willing to allow themselves to partake in a gut-wrenching yet utterly inspiring experience, this one should not be missed."

This film is not for everybody. It is difficult to watch for several reasons. One of them is it depicts in graphic details most horrible atrocities that happened at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Even though many things are not shown directly, our imagination finishes the job. Another reason is that cinematography is on purpose jerky and chaotic to make an affect of being there. Sound track with screams, yells, moans, etc. complete the picture.

Akcja filmu ukazuje 48 godzin z życia tytułowego Szawła. Od razu ostrzegam, że nie jest to film lekki, lub podchodzący do tematyki z dystansem. Jest to bardzo realistyczne ukazanie tego jak wyglądało masowe mordowanie ludności żydowskiej. Przez większość filmu śledzimy akcje zza pleców gł. bohatera. Sprawia to, że immersja w historie jest całkowita. Wielu rzeczy nie widzimy, ponieważ całe tło po za głównym bohaterem jest rozmyte (oczywiście nie całkowicie). Za to działa na naszą wyobraźnie zupełnie co innego - dźwięk. Jęki, krzyki, przekleństwa, rozmowy, strzały, itd. Jest to zaskakujący zabieg i bardzo odważny, ale w rezultacie obraz wydaje się być mocniejszy w odbiorze. Nasza wyobraźnia pracuje na pełnych obrotach.

I saw this movie a long time ago, and my best friend recommended it. Recently I showed it to a couple of friends and rewatched it. 
Little Women is a film based on the novel by Louisa May Alcott, it has been remade multiple times, but the critic consensus is that this one leads beyond any of the other attempts. The story revolves very simply around a woman and her family, the lives they live and struggles/triumphs they encounter.
The writing of this movie is so good. Alcott does deserve credit, lots of it, the characters mold so well. This is clearly a world that has been created carefully. Gerwig essentially just has to use screenplay adaptive skills to make this movie great. Every actor/actress does phenomenally; Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, and Emma Watson in one movie is something of wonder. Especially in the way they treat one another, it's a project everyone wanted to be a part of. (Even the incredible Meryl Streep)"

The movie genre is romance and drama, however it’s entirely unrelated to the main part of young/adult romance, regardless the point of the movie is undercovered. A lot of critics assumed that the movie was going to be a flop, since everybody had fallen in love with the book, so they couldn’t expect at least similar emotions as the book brought to them. Director of the film is definitely able to catch beauty from simple and little things, so the movie teaches us how to pay attention to non-obvious details around us.
Also the acting is icing on the cake. While watching the movie you experience a bunch of different feelings but the actors performance just makes you feel the same way as they do in the film so you automatically become involved in the story. We definitely recommend that movie to everyone, it is rare for that kind of films to be suitable for such a wide audience!! 10/10"

А цей фільм змусив пригадати ті почуття. Мабуть одразу після перегляду я не можу судити про його якість, але він викликає неймовірно сильні почуття, з якого б боку до мене не підібрався. Ще до знайомства з персонажками він приголомшує своєю візуальною складовою: ти захоплюєшся кольорами, захоплюєшся домівками, захоплюєшся деревами на травою, усім навколо. Пейзажі Нової Англії самі собою неймовірні і фільм показує їхню естетику ще краще, занурюючи в ці характерні та мальовничі часи. Стосовно самих героїнь та сюжету. У фільмі хоч і розповідається історія найзвичайнісінької бідної сім'ї: про дівоче кохання, почуття, взаємини між персонажками, їхні сварки та любов однієї до одної, проте й не забувають торкнутися неймовірно важливої проблеми як тих часів, так і сьогодення, а саме утиску прав жінок, при тому торкаються них настільки гармонійно, якісно. Не являючись фільмом виключно про боротьбу за жіночі права він змушує замислитися над цією проблемою та згадати про складнощі, що жінки проходили тоді та проходять зараз. Основна ж сюжетна гілка переповнена емоціями. Як я вже казав, різними, та змінюються вони постійно, залишаючи ще більший відтінок та слід на твоєму серці. Якщо без спойлерів, то це просто дуже якісна історія, що наповнена як драмою, так і комедією, з різноманітними героїнями, кожна з яких є особистістю, кожна з яких цікава, за кожну ти вболіваєш та переживаєш. По ходу фільму емоції до дівчат так само можуть змінюватися, бо побудований він на їхньому моральному зростанні, проте жодна, як на мене, не залишить вас незадоволеним. Це саме історія про життя, можливо достатньо банальна, але близька до серця глядача та здатна підійти до нього з різних боків.
До цього ж варто відмітити музичний супровід, який окремо змусив поридати, особливо через мелодію піаніно близько до кінця фільму.
І цілому, враховуючи побудову фільму, його історію, персонажів (які не тільки хороші самі по собі, а ще й грають їх неймовірні акторки, що бездоганно впоралися зі своїми ролями та вжилися у героїнь), музику, естетику і велику кількість більш дрібних деталей - не можу поставити оцінку нижче. Неймовірно чутливе кіно, яке пізніше я з радістю передивлюся."

The cast is pretty decent overall, with Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Meryl Streep, James Norton and Timothee Chalamet also present. I like that the story has at least an element of female empowerment about it, particularly at the very end. I did cringe at the really 'girly girl' aspects of it and indeed, of course, if your not keen on 'twee' period dramas with giggling female siblings and the like then this may well not appeal to you but even so, I felt this was a well made film and it has enough going for it for the rating I gave it. It won't be for everyone, so I wouldn't outright recommend it to all but if it sounds of interest, if you liked the book perhaps or your keen on the cast, a fan of period dramas and curious about this, then yes, it probably is worth seeing but otherwise, maybe not so much.

............................................................

Mujercitas aborda ciertos avatares en la vida de las cuatro hermanas March, sus padres, amigos y pretendientes a partir de la Guerra de Secesión. Una de ellas, Jo,  escribe y se propone ser una escritora independiente (Saoirse Ronan); Amy pinta (Florence Pugh); Meg actúa (Emma Watson) y Beth toca el piano (Eliza Scanlen). Por el momento su madre, Margaret (Laura Dern) se las arregla sola ya que el padre (Bob Odenkirk) se encuentra en el frente, lo que no le impide permanentes tareas solidarias. Hay una tía acomodada por parte de padre (Meryl Streep) y unos vecinos ricos: un abuelo y su nieto Laurie (Timothée Chalamet) que siempre anda orbitando a las hermanas.

Tanto en la novela original de Louisa May Alcott como en la película planea el tema de qué grado de independencia económica podía lograr una mujer en esa época y qué oportunidades tenían de canalizar sus vocaciones, siendo el matrimonio aparentemente el único destino posible (y no necesariamente salvador). Algo así como el universo de Jane Austin pero en ****. y con las nuevas inquietudes de la época.

Con por lo menos dos versiones cinematográficas anteriores, en ésta, la directora Greta Gerwig realiza dos intervenciones fundamentales: una, en la manera de narrar, ya que alterna permanentemente la época de adolescencia de las hermanas con otra posterior a la Guerra, con las chicas más adultas. Este ir y venir crea en principio confusión, ya que toma al espectador por sorpresa. Por otro lado, en la primera parte de la película, las escenas son más bien corales, lo que sumado al permanente quiebre temporal atenta contra el crecimiento de los personajes y la empatía por ellos. En la segunda parte, en cambio, y ya costumbrados al mecanismo y con abordajes más focalizados, esta forma de relatar crea paralelismos interesantes y el relato se afianza. (Con una historia muy diferente, un planteo temporal similar funciona desde el comienzo en El jilguero, por ejemplo)

La otra intervención, enfatiza el carácter autobiográfico de la novela en la figura de la escritora Jo creando interesantes instancias metaficcionales.

Más allá de esas intervenciones, la realizadora respeta las convenciones del melodrama romántico, que es el que termina cobrando fuerza con sus desencuentros amorosos y rivalidades. De este modo este relato clásico pero intervenido termina funcionando.

Las actrices jóvenes se lucen en sus interpretaciones, Laura Dern luce expresiva y contenida, la tía de la infalible Meryl Streep es la voz del establishment y Chalamet aporta un encanto romántico esencial para su personaje.

La construcción de época es primorosa mientras que la música de Alexander Desplat es innecesariamente enfática.

..........................................................
In both the original novel by Louisa May Alcott and in the film, she plans the issue of what degree of economic independence a woman could achieve at that time and what opportunities they had to channel their vocations, marriage being apparently the only possible destination (and not necessarily savior). Something like the universe of Jane Austin but in the US and with the new concerns of the time.

With at least two previous film versions, in this one, the director Greta Gerwig makes two fundamental interventions: one, in the way of narrating, since it permanently alternates the time of adolescence of the sisters with another after the War, with the girls more adult. This coming and going creates confusion at first, as it takes the viewer by surprise. On the other hand, in the first part of the film, the scenes are rather choral, which, added to the permanent temporary break, threatens the growth of the characters and empathy for them. In the second part, on the other hand, and already accustomed to the mechanism and with more focused approaches, this way of telling creates interesting parallels and the story takes hold. The other intervention emphasizes the autobiographical character of the novel in the figure of the writer Jo, creating interesting metafictional instances.

Beyond these interventions, the director respects the conventions of romantic melodrama, which is the one that ends up gaining strength with her love affairs and rivalries. In this way this classic but intervened story ends up working."

Saoirse Ronan's performance was particularly amazing, although everyone did a great job. Timothy Chalamet was unusually interesting in this one, playing a character with charm, rather than just another emo. I really hope he will bring this sort of charisma into his other **** direction is flawless, the time jumps are inspired, and the way the lighting is used just totally floored me. Fantastic film with a great cast, flawless music, and incredible direction. Could have gone without Emma Watson's sort of out of place performance, but beyond that, it is an amazing film."

I was not familiar with this story and I've been told it's quite close to the book but I'm definitely intrigued enough to go back to the original work now, even knowing of the 700+ page count. It is such a great ensemble piece about the art and lives of these 4 sisters (although only 3 have real arcs imo). Regardless, I loved it and surprisingly saw myself in it quite a bit as well. Great casting has a lot to do with it, but it was an absolute joy seeing these 5 (including Timothee Chalamete) young talented actors in so many gripping scenes together. It was difficult at first to not see Lady Bird, the girl from Midsommar, the girl from Sharp Objects, the guy from Call Me By Your Name, and Hermione, but after about 10 minutes these young talents all fully fell into their roles for me and I was immersed. I did not like the casting of Bob Odenkirk for their father. He had so little to do in the story that I would have rather seen an unknown in that role to avoid Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad jarringly jumping into the movie at the 40 minute mark.

I also particularly loved the wide shots in this film. Cinematographers right now shy away from shooting in more fuzzy or painterly styles but doing so was perfectly on theme for this film about 4 young artists and it made the landscapes pop in a way I haven't seen before. The dancing in the film was shot with appropriate excitement as well.

The pacing dragged for me a little bit after a pivotal point in the film but otherwise I was fully invested throughout. Catch it before its gone!"

The first and half of the second act are very confusing, and a little dull, I must say. Many characters aren't well developed or simply aren't charismatic, which really makes a few moments of the film that should've been quite emotive and sad, not that strong.

The fourth big screen adaptation Alcott’s novel, written and directed by Greta Gerwig, finds a fresh approach to the lives of the March sisters without making any major changes to the well-loved story. Gerwig uses a flashback structure, a steady and lively pace, equally lively performances, and a lovely score by Alexandre Desplat to make this period drama easily engaging to a modern audience. Gerwig begins her film near the end of Alcott’s story with Jo (Saoirse Ronan) living in New York trying to carve out a career as a fiction writer. Her sisters are scattered and wrapped up in their adult lives. Meg (Emma Watson) is raising a family and keeping a house while struggling with money. Amy (Florence Pugh) is learning painting in Europe. Only selfless and caring Beth (Eliza Scanlen) remains with their parents at the March family home in Massachusetts. Then the film flashes back to where to the novel and other film versions begin, with the sisters as adolescents living together under one roof with their mother, Marmie (Laura Dern, with infinite patience and warmness and wisdom). Their father is away serving with the Union army in the Civil War. It is seven years before we began with Jo living in New York.

There is real joy and emotion in the scenes of the March sisters together (that’s the appeal of watching any version of Little Women) but we get time with each of the sisters on their own. We get to know them as individuals and are privy to what is in their minds and hearts. Gerwig put together a fine ensemble but Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh have been singled out by the Academy with Oscar nominations in the Lead and Supporting categories, respectively. This is no surprise since Jo and Amy are the two showy roles.

Ronan brings just the right kind of energy to the rebellious, strong willed, sometimes abrasive, but always charming, Jo. She is full of life and personality without becoming a caricature. On the other hand, I found Florence Pugh’s performance as the youngest sister Amy (a child when the novel begins) so broad as to be distracting. Pugh plays Amy throughout the film, but the younger Amy’s behavior and actions have not been altered in any significant way. So, in the flashbacks we see an adult Florence Pugh speaking and acting like a child even though she looks like a teenager at the youngest (even with her Cindy Brady haircut). This unfortunately makes the younger Amy come off as odd and extra bratty.

Timothèe Chalamet is a perfect fit for the role of Laurie, the dreamy and charming boy next door destined to be intertwined with the March sisters. Chalamet brings a lively physicality to his performance, moving his long, slender body with a lilt that matches the energy of the movie. In smaller but no less entertaining roles are Meryl Streep and Tracy Letts. Streep plays the intimidating and acerbic Aunt March, who is rich enough to be able to speak her mind. She is full of 19th century quips and zingers that are delivered wonderfully. Letts plays a grumpy New York publisher that is willing buy Jo’s stories if they are spicy and if Jo’s female main characters get married at the end, or die. Jo’s conversations with him are entertaining but also come right up against being too meta for the movie's own good (if you weren’t sure about Jo being a stand-in for Alcott, these scenes leave no doubt).

I have to admit that as much the jumps back and forth in time work for the overall structure of the film some of the cuts are not immediately apparent and it takes a moment to figure out where you are in the timeline. Once you get into the rhythm of the pacing, however, you’ll find yourself caught up in the film’s enthusiasm and love for its characters. Right from the start this version of Little Women lets you know that it is not a pageant, not just another recreation of a familiar story, but a new perspective on a classic story that gets to the core of what makes this story timeless. The climax of Gerwig’s adaptation, is not whether or not Jo gets married and to whom, but how she is able to stay true to herself and her dreams and her family."

This is the third version of Little Women in 2 years, and is star studded, with the talented combination of Greta Gerwig and Saorise Roanan who made Ladybird, and Emma Watson is always nice, so I want to try.  The photography is pretty dark, looks like a BBC tv show.  Costumes are very good,  Saoirse is very good, the costumes are well done, the dialog is  a little too contemporary.  The lighting is very dim, the **** starts at 20 minutes. this movie is not for me, made it 30 minutes."
265,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/little-women-2019/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Sierra-117,"Jan 26, 2020",9,"Little Women, based on the Novel by Louisa May Alcott, is a warm yet at times extremely moving tale about the lives of four sisters growing up in the years following the American civil war. Although from the outside it may appear as nothing more than a generic feel-good movie, there is actually a suprising amount of depth to it that distinguishes itself from other Historical dramas. Similar to J.B Priestly's 'An Inspector calls' Little Women sometimes subtly and other times very clearly aims to adress both modern and historic issues such as sexism, which is also one of the main themes of the film.
One thing that you'll immeditely notice when watching the movie is it's extensive collection of talented and famous actors. from rising stars Timothee Chalamet (the king) and Florence Pugh (midsommar) to even breaking bad's Bob Odenkirk, every member of the cast is exceptional in their own way, supporting and main alike. I'd say the standouts for me were Saisoree Ronan, Pugh and Chalamet, but it's so hard to choose from so many stellar performances. Like the acting, the story of this movie almost never falters. At several points the tone is shifted and each time it's always seemless and never uncalled for. However, as the film begins to near it's end a major event takes place which ultimately sets an extraodinarily sad, melancholy tone, but by the time the film was finished this event to me felt somewhat shrugged off, as if it hadn't happened. Although others will certaintly disagree in my opinion it is always better to end the film on a sad note rather than move on, as it leaves a more lasting impression on the viewer. Sometimes it feels kind of cheap to have a happy ending,and for me this was certaintly the case with Little Women. I can definitely forgive this though, as it is not the fault of the film but that of the Author.
Other than that I having absolutely nothing bad to say. Little women is a wonderful and emotional story that remains consstent throughout, and I wholeheartedly believe it deserves its nomination for best picture. Whether it deserves the award is another matter, but to be honest I doubt that it'll break out of the shadow of some of its fellow nominees."

Ronan was excellent as always, Florence Pugh was also superb. The fact both are such outsiders in their oscar categories shows it matters less about performance and more about to whom you have schmoozed in the buildup. Both  Gerwig's writing and direction made for an engrossing watch which will take you on a roller coaster of emotions. It doesn't matter if Gerwig is female or not, the fact she isn't nominated for direction is baffling when put alongside who has made the cut, this film is more impressively shot and comprised than at least two others on the list. Go and see this film, it's certainly one of the best, if not the best, in the cinemas this oscar season."

269,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/little-women-2019/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Jan 17, 2020",8,"I walked into the Classic Gateway Movie Theatre almost with a defiant attitude of ""Show me!"" as I have seen 3 versions, and read the book, of ""Little Women"". No way could anyone be prettier than Elizabeth Taylor in the 1949 version or Katherine Hepburn's strong, steadfast as Jo in the 1933 version or the realistic Jo of Winona Ryder in the 1994 film. After twenty minutes I was confused because the women we are seeing aren't 'little women', they are grown women.

This is the only way that the director/screenwriter Greta Gerwig missteps in both categories because at times it becomes confusing at moments--important moments, otherwise she has kept everything under control from the perfect cast to keeping all important parts of the book.

Most people reading this are familiar with ""Little Women"" either from previous movie versions or actually reading the classic book and if you aren't I don't want to spoil any of the film so on to the cast.

Saoirse Ronan, as Jo, projects a strong women of yesteryear and today and has scored her 4th Oscar nomination. Emma Watson as Meg, Eliza Scanlen as Beth and Florence Pugh, who won a best Oscar supporting actress nomination interact as sisters do while Laura Dern as their mother is warm, stern and her own woman. Meryl Streep is playing Maggie Smith's role from ""Downton Abbey""!

Most of the men, except Timothee Chalamet who plays Laurie, and is prettier than Elizabeth Taylor or anyone in this film, captures the audience in a heartbreaking scene with Jo. Louis Garrel as a language professor in a few short scenes shows he can stand up to whatever is thrown at him. Chris Cooper, as Laurie's, grandfather, opens himself gradually until we get to know this intensely private human scene and Tracy Letts as Jo's first publisher  and James Norton as Meg's husband support the women. ""Little Women"" will take hold of you about 30 minutes into the film and hold on to you for the next 105 minutes."

The acting in this movie is just exceptional from every character especially from the 4 sisters and their mother played by Laura Dern.
Saoirse Ronan shines in this film by giving her best performance and also Pugh's outstanding performance makes this one hell of a movie from start to finish.
The film has some time jumps from present to past frequently which would have confused the audience but it didn't because of the filters used by Greta which makes you understand that part of the film easily. Also the chemistry between these characters is off the charts. Never seen anything in my life like this.
This is one of the best movies of the year and must-watch movie if you are a fan of the book.

This is a sumptuously designed, beautiful-looking saga of love, possibility and the yearning for what could have been, featuring some standout performances from nearly every cast member (though high praise goes to Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh and Timothee Chalamet, in particular) and a truly winsome screenplay and vision from Gerwig herself. Tender, yet pleasant, sad, but still joyous, and challenging and crowd-pleasing all at once, this is most definitely one of the best of the calendar year that was 2019, and yet another reason why Gerwig is one to look out for in terms of burgeoning filmic talents."

It is a story that has been told many times in the cinema. The 2019 film is directed by Greta Gerwig, who had already done a very good job on Lady Bird. In this movie, she still has a very simple and objective direction. The editing of the movie is very well done, it is an edition that holds the viewer in the story. Saoirse Ronan is amazing in this movie, it's a fantastic performance, a well deserved Oscar nomination. Florence Pugh is doing very well too. The other secondary performances are decent: Emma Watson, Eliza Scanley, Timothée Chalamet, Laura Dern, Maryl Streep, Bob Odenkirk. The only flaw of this movie is the first act, which is not bad, but it is a little too dragged, but nothing that spoils the experience.

If you need to be spoon-fed a simple story in coherent chunks, I suggest looking elsewhere. This is not a film for simple-minded people. It wanders and dithers and sprawls and never has the same style for fifteen minutes on end. It is as various and wonderful and infuriating as life itself. It took me about an hour to begin to grasp how the various stories were related to one another, and another couple of hours to see that incoherence was part of the message. The last hour brings the stories home, though it's no place I've ever lived, yet it's every place at once. The array of talent is awesome. If you love theater, you should not miss this film.

This is one of the unique film, and the filmmaking I have seen. It is a docudrama, starred and directed by Jafar Panahi. It is my first film of his and I'm very impressed. I also learnt he was banned from making movies and to leave the country since last 5 years. But he took all the legal route possible to keep making them, and this movie is the result of it. He had made a couple of them before this, but with this he came outdoors to capture the streets of the Iranian capital.

This movie entirely set in a taxi, well, the cameras never leaves the car, but car roams around the city, Tehran. A real time movie that runs for nearly 80 minutes. There's no open or the end credits other than the title texts and some statements. The story was very interesting, that I don't know whether it was scripted or factual, but the planning was so good to shoot it in a low profile.

All the actors except the director were non pros. That definitely needs a loud applaud, because the outcome tells the quality of their exhibition. It gives a glimpse of the life as a taxi driver who sees the city through his eyes and meets the people. Some scenes were extremely funny, some were dark humours and some were thoughtful. Each time when a new character enters the frame, a new topic has brought with them and discussed, that mean the movie is totally engaging with a variety that keeps you hooked till the final.

""We already have the world record of hangings after China.""

I think the end was very smart, because of that kind of conclusion and no post-production credits, I thought that's how the archives were smuggled out of the country and made it ready. But no one knows the truth how it all has been done, otherwise Jafar Panahi would have landed in a trouble. A rare gem and one of the best of 2015 that you must try it if you are a film fanatic.

Initially, I mean before decide to watch it, I was not sure it will reach my expectations. When I sat for it, the experience was different and now I am extremely happy for giving it a try. Opinion might vary about the film, but the effort must be appreciated. Especially in a circumstance where the filmmaker has everything against him, I meant legally, but came strong in what he believes is his passion. That is inspiring and also for a risk he has taken really paid off.

It won a few Internation Filmfare awards and that's how I actually came to know about this. I'm positive this film won't disappoint you as well, well, if you are not looking for twists and turns like an intelligent or a big budget film. As I said, I could have not asked a better than this, a very simple yet entertaining movie.

With World War II getting much of the silver screen treatment? World War 1 has for some strange reason faded from the public consciousness somewhat. Even the Civil War which preceded WWI has had plenty of attention given to it (not that there is anything wrong with that). Ask someone what WWI was and they could probably tell you it was defined by trench warfare. But how much do we really know about it. More importantly how much do we really know about the men that lived through it? This film goes a long way towards giving us the closest possible look into what it was really like. Actual footage has been meticulously restored and colorized. They even employed the use of lip reading to reconstruct what the soldiers were saying. For some the first portion may be boring or feel like a classroom lecture. However the accounts of those that actually lived through it are in a word...priceless.

The final result, Director Peter Jackson has said, “is that we see the war the way they saw it.” Of course, Jackson has chosen the arc of his film – from joy to ennui to disillusionment at best, death at worst. And he has chosen the voices we hear. We see combat the way the director wants us to see it. The film is a technological wonder. Jackson slowed down the 100 hours of silient, jerky film he got from the Imperial War Museum to life-like speeds. He employed lip-readers to determine what the soldiers were saying and supplied those voices. Then he added voice-overs from interviews with more than 120 surviving war veterans whose recollections were recorded in the 1960s and 1970s. His film, though arguably one-sided and focusing on trench warfare, is a tender paean to the men who sacrificed their lives, limbs—and sometimes, faces—for what others thought was the greater good. When you are faced with death, a veteran says, “They say your past comes up in front of your eyes. I was only 19. I hadn’t had any past.”"

Their commentary, as poignant as it was, was given little breathing room, but that's certainly a minor quibble -- this a film not to be missed.

He created this astounding documentary that details the experiences of these men, mostly on the front lines in Belgium. The stories are engaging, gripping and touching. What makes this effort so astounding is the technology that's used to bring the grainy, jerky footage to life with fluid motion, added camera movement and colorization. Although the stories get a bit repetitive and they're sometimes hard to understand (because of accents or too much background noise), it's an absolutely captivating illumination of  the challenges and humanity of war.

But this documentary by Peter Jackson is a triumph of modern technology that brings the old silent black and white films shot by British cameramen in Belgium and France somewhere in the midst of a war that never should have happened.      Historians and history fans like me are familiar with the story of a war of monarchies and incredible loss of life as a result of primarily British Army generals like the worthless Douglas Haig and the criminality and incompetence of a young Winston Churchill, who orchestrated a naval attack in the Dardanelles that was so poorly planned and executed that 50000 British army and navy personnel were mercilessly slaughtered by Ottoman troops who had them pinned down on a thin strip of beach they simply could not escape.       Gallipoli should have ended with Churchill's immediate removal from the Navy and face charges of criminal neglect for his idiocy and refusal up to his death to admit he did anything wrong.             But ""They Shall Not Grow Old"" doesn't focus on one particular battle, but rather a shocking and deeply moving day by day film and narrative description of what fighting in this war was like prior to Americans becoming involved that would finally force Germany to surrender lest that country be totally annihilated by a much superior force.      And it's brutal, like real war is.       No John Wayne heroics here.       No cliched company of about six soldiers of various ethnicities spewing the usual Hollywood cliche **** or somebody getting a nick on the top of the arm.

The early portion of the film is in black and white at training camps in England prior to departure for France and Belgium, where the color begins.      Also, the ability to accurately read the lips of the soldiers and officers and brilliantly synch them into voice overs is jaw dropping.     But lest we get ahead of ourselves, it's all about the war as it really happened.      We are spared some of the most gruesome instances of the Brits attacking German machine guns in the No Man's Land and direct artillery hits because the film makers of the time were not allowed to take part in the actual charges, but to remain in the trenches and film as troops went up, over, and descended straight into Hell.      The rats, magpies, lice, the incredible filth and total lack of sanitation on the front lines is well explained and the sight of mutilated dead soldiers is sobering to say the least.        Trench foot victims are filmed, and those poor men were often killed by gangrene and infections, and survivors routinely suffering amputations of legs to stop the infection.          WWI was truly the most totally miserable war in modern times, the eventual surrender of Germany followed by a vicious Versailles Treaty that would punish as usual the German public more than anybody by reducing them to near starvation and war restitution that only this decade was finally paid off!       One fanatical WWI vet, Adolph **** would use this humiliation to exact revenge on his own 21 years later.               Hollywood needs to make more real documentaries, accurate and moving.        Our willful ignorance of the sacrifices of those who fought, were injured and killed in war to save their nations will have dire consequences.    Those who think war is ""cool"" and something akin to a football game and heroic cliches need to see this film."

From readjusting each clip's frame speed to taking great care to match the silent film with incredible audio. We have loads of documentaries about the importance of Verdun and the Somme, but very few about the actual stories of soldiers from the war. By having only veterans used for voice overs Jackson has created a picture unlike any other that will likely go down as one of the greatest documentaries in history. The film is around 100 minutes and when it came to its closure, I felt like I could easily sit through another two hours. The stories feel personal and genuine. While the film will offer very few ""historical facts"" for history enthusiasts and the general public alike to pick up on, the audience is able to understand what it was like to be a soldier. This film is a masterpiece and is a must see for anyone remotely interested in the subject."

I love war documentaries, and this one was the first of its kind I've seen. Very positive review for that.

The negative thing I need to mention is, the trailer for this film shows a few shots of tanks and soldiers that look fantastic--like they've been restored practically to the point of perfection--looking just like a modern piece of film. However, the majority of the visuals in this film are of significantly poorer quality, with still shots and illustrations often substituted for action shots. Obviously there couldn't have been a cameraman available in many of these situations, but when we're looking at an illustration of a combat scene with a voiceover, this is indistinguishable from many other WWI documentaries I've seen. I was hoping for something really monumental, visually. This isn't that.

Definitely worth seeing for WWI buffs, but not the visual masterpiece it's been promoted to be."

Sarah, the stand-offish incumbent chief of staff, brusquely runs the country while her queen deals with depression, near-madness and a nasty case of the gout. Abigail, a disgraced former upper-class lady who stumbles into the palace smelling of dung and desperation, uses a delicate, sensitive touch to sway the monarch's favor. This pair launches a string of increasingly spiteful schemes and manipulations, always aiming to boost their own standing at the expense of the other. Even the queen isn't above such petty squabbles. Together, the three project a vivid display of willpower, gamesmanship and raw nastiness masked under the guise of civility.

Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are both excellent as the dueling ladies, but I found the experienced, versatile Olivia Colman's turn as Queen Anne most impressive. Nuanced and complex, her performance transforms a rather frail, tragic figure into something larger, something damaged but still formidable. A Best Actress nomination well-earned.

The camerawork sometimes grows over-ambitious (many early shots use a distracting wide-angle lens that feels out of place) and the ending is a bit of a head-scratcher, but otherwise The Favourite is a well-balanced, deliciously mean-spirited battle of wits."

Being a Yorgos Lanthimos film, its really quite insular and almost voyeuristic in a sense, with the fish eye lens camerawork. There are some sexual scenes present and also very strong, graphic language used throughout, so be aware of that (hence the 15 rating it carries). There is a distinct sense of back stabbing present and it was an intriguing watch, seeing who attempts to out smart or out-do who and so on. The costumes are, of course, lavish and the cast all do well in their roles, which certainly helps. This is a film well worth seeing, for Olivia Coleman and Emma Stones performances, if nothing else - just don't expect it to be a Downtown Abbey type film, mostly suitable for family viewing, as this isn't.  Its, at heart, a film depicting power play.

Its about as edgy as most of Lanthimos' other films, with some good pieces of witty dialogue and also worth mentioning, I feel, is the classical score, which helps add to the atmosphere of most scenes. It may be a slightly slow moving film, plot wise, but its certainly an engrossing watch overall, so I recommend it on that basis."

The Favourite explores the controlling elements of love and how love can be used as both a constructive and destructive force. Lanthimos creates fleshed out and complex characters in this film, each one having independently unique and divergent motivations and agendas. With this said, The Favourite is also a tale about how conflicting agendas resolve themselves. The three leading women are phenomenal. While they do play up their performances to a certain degree, the performances they end up giving suit the vein of the movie exactly.

""The Favourite"" directed by Yorgos Lanthimos is an amazing movie about cousins Abigail Hill and Sarah Churchill vying to become Queen Anne's favourite.

The Good:
-The acting. Emma Stone, Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz are amazing in this movie, but Olvia Colman as Queen Anne steals the show and I'm happy that she won the Academy Award. Her acting might be a little exagerated and over-the-top at some points, but Queen Anne is not just a ""cartoon"" of a character, she actually has a backstory and a reason to act the way she acts (this is a spoiler-free review, so obviosuly I won't mention it). Emma Stone also did a great job and if she was the lead, I guess she could've taken the award instead.
-The directing is so good, I like how this movie is shot. It has so many ""dynamic"" shots in so many scenes that makes a normal two-people conversation actually visually interesting. If Alfonso Cuarón wasn't nominated for Best Director at the Oscars for his work on Roma, I think Lanthimos could've win the award. I loved the cinematography overall, the color palette fits the mood and time period of the movie and the costumes and sets are all pretty good.
-The script is good. The movie is not as funny as I thought it would be but it is never boring, there's always something interesting happening on screen, the characters are well developed and written, that's why the acting is amazing and the dialogue is also pretty good.
-I liked the score. Yes, it's nothing too amazing or innovative, but it fits well the movie and the tone.

The Bad:
-Honestly I don't have any complaints with this movie. Maybe as a stupid nitpick, the texts that indicates the beggining of a new act are a little hard to read, but maybe it's just me.
-I guess the ending was a little disappointing, but that doesn't ruin the movie, nor my opinion on it.

This was my choice for Best Picture at the 2019 Oscars, but I guess I understand why Green Book won instead. This is an amazing movie that tells you an interesting story, but that's it, it's not a movie that tries to change your mind or anything and while I think it's better than Green Book overall, maybe that movie won the big prize for its subject matter."

At first glance The Favourite might seem to be just another British costume drama but this very R-rated story about the private relationships of Queen Anne absolutely subverts genre expectations. Everything from the stylistic choices to the characters make this a darkly comedic, vulgar, and wonderfully outrageous film. This is one of my favorite films of 2018. It is so totally engrossing with such memorable characters and scenes (especially an elaborate and ludicrous dance) that I had to see it twice.

Queen Anne ruled England from 1702 to 1714. The highlight of her reign was overseeing the union of England and Scotland in 1707 (creating the kingdom of Great Britain), something no previous English king had managed to achieve. This film focuses not so much on history but speculates on her personal relationships. Her closest friend since childhood, Lady Sarah Marlborough (Rachel Weisz), acts as Anne’s caregiver, companion, adviser, and lover. She even runs the country for Anne. Lady Sarah’s status is challenged when her cousin, Abigail (Emma Stone), begins to work her way into the Queen’s favor.

Anne may have had a royal life but it was not an easy one. She suffered through 17 miscarriages, still births, and untimely infant deaths, the death of her husband, and many physical ailments. She was the last monarch of the House of Stuart and only 49 when she died. Olivia Colman wonderfully portrays Queen Anne as a fragile, wounded soul searching for small moments of happiness, and also capable of acting like a spoiled child or a mad monarch at any given moment. Though Anne is more of a supporting character, Colman has picked up an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. She’s so good I can’t complain about her being in the wrong category.

Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are really the leads but they have each been nominated in the Supporting Actress category. Each actress gives the best performance of her career, though each already has an Oscar for a movie and performance I didn’t particularly care for (Emma Stone-La La Land) and a movie and performance I keep forgetting exists (Rachel Weisz-The Constant Gardener). Lady Sarah and Abigail offer Anne different kinds of love: Lady Sarah tells Anne the truth even if it is harsh and unpleasant, Abigail always flatters Anne. Weisz has no problem going from loving and sweet to stern and even cruel. She delivers crude, acerbic insults with deft ease. Weisz is also quite comfortable and easily believable as an intelligent, capable woman in power—using that power often and effectively—controlling and besting her male political counterparts. Both Weisz’s Lady Sarah and Stone’s Abigail manipulate Queen Anne for their own gain, but Abigail is the more insidious of the pair. Emma Stone has never had a role like this before. Her character is clever, funny, and charming, and also devious, selfish, and quite unlikable. Stone does a great job handling all the different facets Abigail. Director Yorgos Lanthimos and cinematographer Robbie Ryan make frequent use of fish-eye lens and canted angles to keep the audience off balance. They use slow motion for particular moments and holds on close ups of faces when the instinct of any other period movie would be to show as much as possible. The costumes by Sandy Powell look fresh and unique and not just like the costumes we see on a regular basis in period pieces. Lady Sarah, as a woman in power, is an unconventional character for her time and she has unconventional costumes to match. Her shooting outfit, which includes a hat and trousers, is the most memorable costume in the movie. Even the costumes for the men have interesting flourishes. Big, long crazy wigs were very in style. The foppish opposition party, led by Nicholas Hoult, even powder their faces. “A man must make himself look pretty,” he says.

Yorgos Lanthimos's previous films include the bizarre Dogtooth and the love it or hate it The Lobster (I hated it). This is easily his most mainstream movie, which is saying something since The Favourite might be the most unconventional period movie since Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette. Unlike his previous films, Lanthimos did not pen the screenplay (Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara wrote The Favourite's Oscar nominated original screenplay); this might be why the material is palatable. There is just the right blend of humor and melancholy in The Favourite, but as the film goes on it moves into dour territory in the third act. It is as if Lanthimos couldn't let a whole film go by without injecting some of his dour, bleak sensibility. Still, I very much recommend The Favourite for its fresh take on an established genre and the brilliant performances by Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone. Even as they are being outrageous and vindictive, these people are a delight to watch."

Although The Favourite, the seventh feature from Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos, eschews both convention and expectation, it's also his most accessible film by a mile. A merciless satire of decadence, a savage morality play, a camp comedy of manners, a Baroque tragedy, an allegorical study of the corruptive nature of power - it's all of these and yet none of them. On the one hand, it's too long, the plot too threadbare, and the metaphors too ill defined. On the other, the acting is flawless, it looks amazing, and it's as funny as it is dark.

Originally written by Deborah Davis in 1998 and later refined by Tony McNamara, the film is set in England in 1708, and tells the story of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (Rachel Weisz) and one-time scullery maid Abigail Hill (Emma Stone) and their increasingly bitter rivalry for the affections of Queen Anne (a mesmerising Olivia Colman). Historians, however, probably won't be too thrilled to learn that Lanthimos is relatively uninterested in either historical actuality or socio-political contextualisation. This is a story about a love triangle, with everything else just the background against which that triangle plays out.

The film's most salient theme is the dynamic of gender politics. For starters, it's headlined by three actresses (something which is still rare enough as to be notable), whilst the men are background players, existing only to be mocked, exploited, and duped. However, what's interesting is that the world of women is anything but a utopia. Yes, it's relatively free of toxic masculinity and the male gaze, but in most other aspects, there's no real difference between the matriarchy and the patriarchy. The women may be smarter, but they are no less greedy or cruel. When asked by the Hollywood Reporter if a film about females treating each other badly might be considered a setback in a post #MeToo era, Colman explained, ""How can it set women back to prove that women fart and vomit and hate and love and do all the things men do? [...] That's what's nice. It doesn't make women an old-fashioned thing of delicacy.""

As one would expect from Lanthimos, the film is aesthetically flawless. Director of photography Robbie Ryan makes copious use of 6mm fish-eye lenses, which give the impression of characters lost within an overload of background visual detail. Combined with the whip pans seen throughout the film, the cumulative effect is a world rendered strange, a place of distortions.

Elsewhere, the emotionless and monotone delivery of dialogue has been scaled back from The Lobster (2015) and The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), but everything else you'd expect from Lanthimos is here - the pseudo-omniscient judgemental glare; the absurdist humour; the formal rigidity; the surrealism; the games of psychological one-upmanship; intimate familial conflict; a disorienting score.

In terms of acting, there really are no words to describe how good Colman is. Utterly inhabiting the character, she communicates a sense of both tragic inevitability and a childlike refusal to accept reality. The character could easily have been a grotesque villain or a pitiful broken shell, but Colman finds a nobler middle ground, straddling both interpretations without fully committing to either, moving from one to the other seamlessly throughout the film. Rather than trying to downplay the contradictory facets of the character, Colman leans into them, finding Anne's humanity amidst her least appealing characteristics.

As regards criticisms, although I personally wouldn't class them as flaws, some people will probably dislike the same things that many have disliked in Lanthimos's previous work - formal rigidity, perverse sense of humour, and irredeemable characters being irredeemably horrible to one another. There will also be those who find the obviously intentional anachronisms and historical inaccuracies too much. My biggest issue was that oftentimes the film seemed to be trying trying to work through an identity crisis, unsure of exactly what kind of tone to settle on. Additionally, some of the allegories are never fully fleshed out.

Neither morally enlightening nor historically respectful, The Favourite offers a bleak assessment of humanity's core drives. The characters live in a milieu of egotism, narcissism, sexual cruelty, psychological bullying, and greed. There's barely a hint of sentimentality, and very little that could be called morally righteous. I would have liked it to have more meat on its bones, but at the same time, one cannot deny it presents something of a faithful looking-glass, as Lanthimos continues to corner the market in pointing out not just humanity's worst foibles, but its most bizarre eccentricities."

Everything from a technical stand point is masterful. Yorgos Lanthimos has yet to make a bad movie or even an average one.

One of the best of 2018."
346,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-favourite/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,IsaacJ,"Jan 6, 2019",9,"With Olivia Colman set to follow on from Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth in the third season of The Crown, it seems a satisfying coincidence that Yorgos Lanthimos’ latest film The Favourite sees the actress take on the role of another monarch. The Crown may be the dictionary definition of period drama, but The Favourite is a very different affair, a tantalising twist on what often promises to be a dull sub-genre.
Here, Colman stars as Anne, the last Stuart queen “stalked by tragedy”, ravaged by gout and depression, with her pet rabbits her only solace. She has passed on the keys of power to her closest confidant and secret lover, Lady Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), but all is turned on its head with the arrival of Abigail Hill (Emma Stone) a once noblewoman whose family has fallen on hard times. As Abigail surprisingly gains the favour of the Queen, so begins a ruthless battle that plays out before our eyes in a particularly captivating power struggle between the three women.
The Favourite is an enthralling film; Lady Sarah and Abigail turn loyalty into an increasingly vicious blood sport, making for a narrative littered with gratifying double-crossing, carnal intensity and stylish brutality, all accompanied by an almost illusionary sense of madness. It can only be defined as a tragicomedy, subtly hilarious yet hiding timely subtext that is delightfully ambiguous. The lines between love and deception are expertly blurred in a film that takes no prisoners in its uproarious execution. There is more deliberation in the overblown final act, however, that feels lengthy and distinctly less focused than the rest of the film.
The movie finds its greatest strength in its stellar cast, led by Colman, Stone and Weisz. Colman is outstanding as Anne, hilariously petulant and childlike, reminiscent of Miranda Richardson’s Queenie in Blackadder. There’s a blunt imperiousness to Colman’s performance that carries the film through with black humour. Beyond this, however, the scenes of greatest emotional resonance are those that show the more tragic side of Anne, as a woman who has lost seventeen children (“Some were born in blood, some without breath and some were with me a very brief time”) and has never recovered from the trauma. Colman breezes through these harsher scenes that cut surprisingly deep and help to give the film a greater purpose.
Rachel Weisz is the epitome of calculated steeliness as Lady Sarah and Emma Stone is pitch perfect in her first period role as the opportunistic and marvellously Machiavellian Abigail. Nicholas Hoult’s flamboyant Leader of the Opposition leads several foppish male roles, but these lie clearly in the peripheral; Yorgos Lanthimos makes apparent that the film’s sole focus is its women, all of whom are callous, yet vulnerable, but all quite brilliant in different ways.
The Favourite is beautifully designed, lavish costumes by Sandy Powell and a regal set giving the film all the expected grandeur of a period drama. The film’s more salacious side, however, is shown in Robbie Ryan’s absurdist cinematography which, whilst occasionally pretentious, gives a haunting contemporary spin. I was less of a fan of the wide-angled bend shots, as well as the film’s soundtrack (from Handel to the itchy modernism of Anna Meredith), which felt invasive and ceaseless.
Here, Yorgos Lanthimos has struck a fine chord. The Favourite is a wonderfully unusual and unsettling film that is at points gratuitous, but generally audacious and exciting. Spellbinding performances and an intriguing story make this not one to miss out on."

Anyone who knows me will tell you I don't like period dramas, but this is far from your ordinary period drama. This is a Yorgos film and with director Yorgos Lanthimos I got what I expected and so much more. The three central performances from Coleman, Weisz and Stone elevate this quirky historical film. If this is your first experience with a Lanthimos film then you're either in for a real treat, or you'll leave bitterly disappointed, or you'll walk out half way through. You really won't be able to tell until you give it a chance so get on board the Award Season train and go see The Favourite.

18th century England under the rule of a frail Queen Anne (Olivia Coleman). Her close friend Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) governs the country while tending to her ill health. Their friendship takes a change when a new servant, Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives. Sarah takes Abigail under her wing, and Abigail takes this opportunity to fulfill her ambitions at any means necessary. It's delightfully disturbing, funny and unpredictable all at the same time. I might have preferred a little beheading but that's just me. I absolutely loved Olivia Coleman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, their acting was superb. Particularly Coleman, perfect casting, she dominates every scene. One of the strangest films you could watch, I'm still trying to decide how much I liked it and the ending is perhaps a little dissatisfying, yet one thing I'm certain of, I'll still be thinking about this film for a while. If the Lobster or The Killing of a Sacred Deer is your cup of tea then The Favourite is not to be missed. Highly recommended."

The Favourite

Lanthimos's tug of war is the most simplistic and cinematic project of his that isn't necessarily gloomy or sinister. Set as a period drama, the storyline takes off in a humorous tone that feels eerily intangible. But this is Lanthimos, this quirkiness has been his forte since The Lobster, and using it wisely to boost off for a head start, the film gains a ferocious pace as it ages on screen.

One of the oldest and repetitive tricks of the writers Davis and McNamara to lighten the mood is through using an uncouth language to voice their deepest feelings and since they live around the rich and clean Royal world, the irony tickles you down to rubble. But this incongruent vocab of theirs grows on you and the ratio of humor reduces as cutthroat politics gets in, along with jealousy, seduction and rage that follows the entire film into a darker tone; compared to The Lobster and The Killing Of The Sacred Deer, it still is the merrier one.

Since there is a lot to cover and equally sincerely and slowly to be projected, the sequences are often or not started as an aftermath that gives the makers quite a leap on the timeline to chew in the material as a slow and effective pill. This flamboyant vocab of the writers sails smoothly across the screen with comfort on narration that is gripping and absorbing as much as layered it is. And to succeed over this trifecta that every writer dreams of, Davis and McNamara has managed to weave out the best work of their career. Colman as the least concerned Queen of England has a behemoth of a character to climb upon.

And with her experience and deep dive into the character including the voice and the body language, she makes sure she earns the title with a big glossy tiara on her head. In her latter intense stage, the vulnerable yet not weak persona of hers is admirable but I'd prefer Colman in initial carefree stage where she is simply flat out hilarious. Stone in her surprisingly negative role is as good as she is on mocking the other characters unflinchingly. Playing the double agent on both the sides, she is the real schemer of the tale, her sassiness grows beyond her control and the film gets juicier and juicier in her reign.

But among all, personally I feel connected to Weisz's underdog character that evolves into the soul of the film. Her character steals the show not for the poignancy or the ""pity"" aspect of hers, but her innocence of the affection that floats untouched and pure in this lethal sandwich of love and war. Lanthimos's world does not believe on amending the broken bonds, resuming the clock from zero, it always seeks for a fresh start, a clean slate. The Favourite is a comic tale that takes itself seriously and works hard to be independent of any agendas or schemes which Lanthimos reveals upfront to you, honestly."
349,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-favourite/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,agrlhsnousrname,"Jan 2, 2019",9,"The Favourite is a movie that reminds one why the movies are a magical place. The Favourite brings the art of acting and filmography back to the cinemas. The Favourite puts a humorous spin on a classic like a historical drama with a healthy dose of refreshing comedy. The Favourite breaks tradition from other movies that focus on over the top humor. The movie is riddled with well planned wit and subtle satire. Although it’s safe to assume every director, producer and actor wants the movie to do well and make money, it seems The Favourite’s biggest motivation is going back to the roots of cinema and focusing on the art of the craft rather than the profits or dominating the box office. It’s a movie made for the sake of reminding the audience and crew alike what cinema is really all about. Although The Favourite is a pleasure to watch, it is slow moving and lacks a clear plot line. For anyone seeking a ‘Die Hard’ like flick, seek elsewhere. For everyone else, enjoy a movie that reminds movie lovers why we are movie lovers in the first place."
350,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-favourite/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,OlivierPiel,"Jan 2, 2019",8,"Move over Barry Lyndon! Lanthimos atomizes Kubrick in this film. What a very witty tour de force. He took almost exactly the same themes and succeeded where Kubrick failed. As a teenager I was in love with that movie, the exquisite photography, the incredible tension and the score of course. But Barry Lyndon felt soulless, a form of ""anti-cinema"", with gorgeous vignettes followed by weak exposition scenes, and atrocious dialogues. Lanthimos remedies all this here. This was the age of the Baroque, of the extravagance. Therefore he introduces a wild, outrageous cinematography that more acutely exposes the decadence of the 17th century aristocracy, than Kubrick's simple homage to classical paintings and music. The scene where Queen Anne tells a small quintet playing atrocious Haendel to bugger off was a nod to this I think. Minus 2 points for the miscasting of Emma Stone. Overacting, too self-aware, too American. Very annoying. Almost ruins this very funny film."
351,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-favourite/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TrevorsView,"Dec 27, 2018",8,"“I like it when she puts her tongue inside me.” Yes, I crap you not: that’s a legitimate line heard in one of the Oscar frontrunners, one that I can even argue has a legitimate chance at winning the top prize of the night. It’s both your typical awards fare and everything against the Oscar tropes: it’s an early 18th century setting about a crabby old queen (okay, fine… she’s not that old, she’s like, 42) who suffers from gout, and features an actress in the lead who won a little golden naked man for playing a struggling actress. But you know what else this motion picture contains? A duck race, badger-style makeup, mud baths, fish-eye lenses, walls buried under tapestries, smoke rings, oranges thrown at a naked man in a pink wig, Emma Stone’s boobs, and lots of pet rabbits. Believe it or not, it’s bound to be The Favourite of the Academy.

It’s miraculous to see how director Yorgos Lanthimos drags us down his rabbit hole to intoxicate us with his mad tea party where the hopping madness of the queen’s new servant (Stone) initiates an inconceivable battle of wits between herself and her cousin (Weisz). Every single frame looks like one of the numerous works of anti-art hung up in the queen’s castle, with doses of natural light used to illuminate the large interiors that tighten in on you through their arches. When there’s no sun available, candle lights are relied upon to darken the tone, making the women’s angst feel greater. Then when the perspective of the storytelling shifts into this new servant girl’s point of view, the proper look of the screen suddenly turns bulbous as if looking through the eyes ****. You really do feel like you’ve gone mad in Lanthimos’ not-so-wonderous land of hearts.

What’s so grand about these three women fighting for power is that it all takes place in a single location, the only real change being the leisure outdoor bird-shooting. The bounding to the castle that almost feels like a character itself is a creative choice not implemented enough with other period pieces that instead decide to let the lavish sets and costumes take the narrative wheel. While these are still the best sets and costumes 2018 has had to offer, they never become the focus for a second. It’s all just a matter of escalating the three-way tension.

Speaking of three-ways, I should forewarn you that there is plenty of lesbianism that these women share with one another. That is, the two servants fight for the affections of the queen, a fight that even turns near-fatal at one circumstance or another. Although, it’s worth noting by fact checkers that it was never 100% confirmed that Queen Anne was ever a lesbian, and implementing it as a core part of this story probably was not fair to do, especially while leaving out her real-life husband from the story who died before the events told here. Yet for what this film strove to do, it gladly did not fall into the trap of turning the lovemaking full-on steamy, just enough of it is shown to give the idea without detracting from what each character feels.

Now, how should you feel as you watch The Favourite? Most likely, you’ll be rolling on the floor in laughter. I certainly was, maybe not literally, but next to Paddington 2, no other movie of 2018 made me laugh harder than this one. The eruptive line deliveries that the three women explode out of their vocal cords got the audience of my screening roaring with laughter as much as any other family comedy; what got me laughing the hardest was a wondrously bizarre dance that looked much like two courting geese. Oh, and the duck race at the beginning: that “quacked” me up quite a bit!

Such a flavor for humor displays the film’s ironic mindset of mocking the mad British monarchy, for even now, just like hundreds of years ago, women wanting to strangle one another for power always gets out of hand. That doesn’t at all mean this movie is anti-men, anti-women, or anything even remote to that. It instead testifies to all women with given authority over men how they must honor their authority while also honoring one another. It’s not a manner of which one with the most prominent “V” should be at the top of the pyramid, it’s a manner of us all being together, aligned toward the same goal.

Just to be plain, this movie is not for everyone. In fact, I say its totally bizarre narrative and tone makes it one of those movies only made to appeal to a select few who can appreciate its narrative approach. Odds are, a woman getting brutally scarred by a horse is not your idea of funny and watching two women feeling up one another is not the best way for you to see the dangers of women abusing their authority. That’s why extreme caution is advised, but that’s the way it should be. Yorgos Lanthimos’ newest masterwork is indeed a complicated movie about complicated topics and is not something anyone should think of taking lightly. Now, who wants some blue waffles?"

I would even say for adult women. Like the hero of the ""Boku dake..."", the main character - Taeko - goes back in time to her school years to rethink them and to comprehend what to do with her life. Or rather, she goes on a trip to rural area, on vacation, and takes with her ten-year-old herself, imposing childhood memories on her present life.

It looks like Takahata Isao made an anime about downshifting before it even got into fashion. In a sense, Taeko really turned on the lower gear - she slowed down her life, because she realized that she was going the wrong way. The old Toshio's car, slow and stalling now and then, but nevertheless loved and preferred to newer cars, is a kind of metaphor for the main message of the ""Only Yesterday"". Another metaphor voiced by Taeko herself is the caterpillar, which needs to become a chrysalis in order to turn into a butterfly and to fly away.

And why did Taeko take ten-year-old herself on vacation? It's strange even to her - it's not because of bright memories about her youth in the 60s, not about hairstyles, boyfriends, ""Beatles"" and miniskirts, like her sisters memories. Not at all. This is a little girl's memory on the verge of growing up - school and home. Taeko answers herself - it was then the chrysalis for the first time decided to become butterfly. She ""swallowed nonsense about fractions"" and chose work, career, success. At first it seemed to her that she was flying, but in reality she was only flapping her wings without moving. Because two thirds of an apple didn't want to be divided by one quarter, and the exotic pineapple turned out to be much worse than usual banana. Now, it is time for already grew up Taeko to become ""chrysalis"" in order to try to fly for real. And who knows, perhaps, along this path - traveling in space and time - she will find kindred spirit and meaning?"

Only Yesterday is a lesser known Ghibli film, because it's director by Isao ""The other guy"" Takahata, whos works are often overlooked, as he has the weirder, less appealing, and less kid friendly films (See, ""Pom Poko"" and ""Princess Kaguya""). As a director or film maker, excluding his use of Ghibli as a studio, I'd say he is one of the greatest Japanese directors of all time.

Only Yesterday is a very simple movie about a girl moving her life to the country, assimilating to farming, and finding love.  It's slow, realistic, and showcases the ups and downs in life, and it flashes back consistently through the main character's childhood.

The movie tone is very bittersweet, and for an animation, feels more real than most live action romance films from Asia that I've seen.

It's quite quiet, dialogue wise but that's not a bad thing I felt. I enjoyed the cinematography - I like that its understated. Laidback is a term I'd definitely use to describe this film. I suppose its a nice depiction of male companionship to an extent and it highlights a form of isolation that the two main characters no doubt feel regardless. I thought the two main characters were well portrayed by John Magaro as Cookie and Orion Lee as King-Lu - I didn't really recognise anyone other than Toby Jones, who seems a nice enough guy at first (he plays the 'chief factor', who is unnamed). I'd say there is a bit of a moral aspect to it. Its not a film for people who like constant action and are hoping for a high octane type Western film but I would say its pretty atmospheric never the less and I definitely enjoyed it overall, very much so.

Rather than trying to explain it to others, I would suggest you try one of her movies out and see if it is the kind of thing you enjoy.  I'll forewarn, it is a visual experience more than auditory.  So, be prepared to carefully take in the visual and realize there is not a lot of talking.

Perhaps start with ""Night Moves"" which is probably her most approachable film and gradually work your way to something like ""First Cow"".

The cinematography is the one aspect I found to be excellent. The framing is on point and impressive and it adds a lot to the film’s style. The production design and costumes are also really good here too. These characters look and feel as if they in the 1820s. The performances are also great too. Each character feels believable and works to help tell the story of the film. Although I like all that, the pacing is not very good. It feels incredibly long and tedious without any real majorly satisfying payoff. It’s a 2 hour movie that feels like it goes on for 2 and a half hours. If they had cut down some of the scenes, this issue wouldn’t be as major as it is. There were some elements of the story I enjoyed and some I found to be pointless. If you like A24 then check it out but don’t have your hopes incredibly high for it."

First Cow is a glorious film. Masterful pacing. The world building is phenomenally engrossing. The film techniques are immaculate. The script is sparse and exacting. Kelly Reichardt has been a film lover's filmmaker since the beginning of her career and she has me enthralled with her mastery of film language. Gosh dang it, give this movie your attention."

It could certainly be said that even the most atmospheric films are still a means of entertaining, but even in the face of the excellent quality of the production, it will all be reduced to whether this is the kind of film you're looking for as entertainment.

Kelly Reichardt's new film is an adaptation of Jon Raymond's novel, The Half-Life. He also wrote the screenplay alongside Reichardt.
I honestly don't have any opinions on the novel because I didn't even know it, so I can't tell if the director's treatment was the right one but regardless of that fact, personally I think Reichardt delivered a great film.

First Cow favors tone and atmosphere over narrative, therefore I must emphasize that although the friendship story is the main engine of the film; The rhythm, the lack of dialogue and the way in which events unfold, are things that are more focused on your immersion in the situation rather than just observing it from a distance.

John Magaro and Orion Lee are completely in tune and both actors hold the film perfectly because as I said this is a story about friendship and because of the lack of dialogue, the only thing that makes that believable, are their expressions and emotions and they both do a pretty good job.

First Cow will reward your patience if you allow it to captivate you and you allow yourself to absorb its pace and story.

To me was a great film and is yet another strong addition for A24’s catalogue."

377,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/first-cow/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,moviemitch96,"Jul 22, 2020",7,"In this film, a late 1800s Oregon fur trapper meets and befriends a Chinese immigrant, and together, they decide to try and get ahead by secretly stealing the milk from a local cow owned by a wealthy landowner in order to make cakes and pastries out of it to sell to people. It's a small and intimant film with a simple premise, but it's still very effective thanks largely in part by the two lead performances and chemistry of John Magaro and Orion Lee as fur trapper Cookie and humble immigrant King-Lu respectively. Their onscreen friendship is undeniably charming to watch, and I found myself rooting for them in their strive for a better and more prosperous life from start to finish. From a technical aspect, the film is beautifully shot, even settling for a smaller aspect ratio in order to better fit with the times it's portraying, and each shot in the film almost appears as an old photograph come to life. It moves a little slow and takes its time, but in doing so, it manages to illustrate the quest for prosperity and simple pleasures in a unique way and is shown in a time period not seen too often in film. Overall, it's a slow and simple yet ultimately humble period film that tells a nice friendship story while it's at it, making it worthwhile enough."

Fury Road puts foot to floor right from the opening bell and never lets up, somehow topping itself over and over again, even when it seems like there's nowhere left to go. It's joyous anarchy, a world that thrives on all of society's dirty secrets; completely post-apocalyptic crazy but also a little more familiar than we'd care to admit.

Of course, it's a visual powerhouse - a glowing example of art direction, stunt driving, cinematography and character design that's damn near unrivaled in modern cinema - but it's also an audio behemoth. Like Inception's deep bellow or Terminator's ominous rumble, Mad Max 4 can convey a looming sense of dread through its frequent, effective use of bass. You feel that rumble? That's the ride starting back up again. Junkie XL's accompanying soundtrack is a perfect tonal match, the right blend of fuzzy, maxed-out guitar licks and incessant, pounding tribal drums.

Perhaps most impressively, the film doesn't feel obligated to dig up every last bit of backstory on its way to the finish line. If anything, it revels in leaving that to the viewer, whose imagination is bound to fill in the blanks for such a broad, wildly eccentric cast of characters far better anyway. It's a raucous success, a lethal dose of sensory overload that hits like a two-hour surge of adrenaline. I loved it, constantly shaking my head at the experience and laughing at myself like a little kid at his first R-rated movie. Loved every minute.

Revised thoughts after a 2016 re-watch: Technically and visually, there's really nothing that can compete with this. A continuously dazzling, picturesque visual marvel that's half Burning Man and half Clockwork Orange, I could sit back and just soak up the atmosphere for hours without complaint.

The opening forty minutes, almost exclusively an action/chase scene, are absolutely captivating and whip past in a heartbeat. It slows down momentarily after that, if just to offer the audience a fleeting lungful of air, but we're rarely more than five minutes from our next pulse-rocking orgasm of steel and violence.

The story is conveyed in bursts and shreds, often illuminating just enough of the world to force more questions, which probably bucked some viewers. If we look closely enough, though, many of those answers arrive via background action or subtle hints. That uber-minimal approach gives us extra time to linger in the visual splendor, while still feeling nourished by a story that's more than just skin and bones. Still one of my favorite films of the last ten years, and a must-have for any home Blu-Ray collection."

The characters and Godlike action sequences really carry the movie. Despite the story being one long car chase, their's literally never a dull moment. The high octane car chases and superb action choreography is absolutely phenomenal, definitely the best aspects of the film. I honestly really respect George Miller and his film crew for trying to keep all the stunts real and authentic, instead of flooding the screen with half-baked, aged CGI like most Hollywood movies. My only gripe is Tom Hardy's performance as Max, he certainly isn't Mel Gibson and he kinda gives a lackluster performance in this film, despite taking up the mantle of a legendary character like Max. Not to mention, Max feels like a side character in what is supposedly his movie. But it's quite obvious that Furiosa is the main character and the one character I truly grew emotionally attached to. Charlize Theron gave a memorable and believable performance and easily outshines the other actors. Also, shout out to Knux for unironically being one of the best characters in this film; the ending to his character arc is perfection. This is easily my favorite Mad Max movie and I could watch it a dozen times and still be entertained. Whether you're a fan of the Mad Max movies or not, I HIGHLY recommend giving this movie a watch."

There were breathtaking car and motorbike chases, spectacular hand-to-hand combat scenes and normal shooting too.

The story and the character of Furiosa were very intriguing. The acting was great, especially from Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy of course. There were very few moments that felt weird or out of place unlike the third installment in the franchise.

The visuals have never been better in the franchise and the cinematography is still most impressive. Speaking of most impressive things there was an amazing reference to Star Wars. Immortan Joe's car made a strange sound which was used before in the Millennium Falcon, when it could not start.

I hope we get a sequel, but if they finish off Max's story here, I'm satisfied."

However, in this one, every word of this title exactly matches what you’re about to see in this film. Mad Max Fury Road, released back in 2015, follows the protagonist of the Mad Max film series, Max Rockatansky (played by Tom Hardy). Considered a reboot/sequel, this film follows Max as he travels the world, a vast wasteland, while haunted by nightmares and does whatever necessary to survive. Soon though, he’s taken by the local warlord named Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne) and is now prisoner to his minion’s known as War Boy’s. One such War Boy named Nux (played by Nicholas Hoult). Max is taken deeper into the wasteland, onto the Fury Road, in pursuit of a woman named Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron) who has taken valuable cargo from Joe. Across the wasteland is danger, loud roar of engines, gun fights, and of course, pure madness.	
The trailers perfectly visualize everything you will see in this film. Loud car crashes, fire everywhere, dust flying into everything, and a man playing guitar on top of a moving vehicle, while shooting flames out of said guitar (you read that correctly). This movie promises madness from a mad world and it delivers. For viewers looking for non-stop (literally) action and top-notch special effects, this film is for you. Better buckle your seat belts because once the engines turn over, the vehicles don’t stop for anything. Survival is paramount and only the mad survive. What makes this movie really stand out is the high-end special effects and sound. The intensity of each action sequence is captured using the best technology at the time. CGI is heavily used of course, but all of that is lost in the chase. All this being said, if you are looking for story development and strong dialogue maybe save this movie for another day. 	
This movie put all the time and resources into the action sequences. We get a glimpse of the lost world that is the Mad Max world, and in a short time, the action starts. The audience gets the basic level of character introduction, and by the end of the movie, only a small amount of development happens. Not much can be said about Max’s character because more time is concentrated on Furiosa and her storyline. Almost as though, this movie could be called Furiosa…. However, it is ordinary for action movies not to dive deep into the characters themselves. Yet again, I suppose if we are to judge a character by their actions, we have plenty of examples of character development in this film. Main characters saving lives in a world governed by madness, what motivates them? 	
Overall, this movie is not for the faint of heart. This movie is made for thrill seekers who want to go fast, stay fast, and be loud in the process. The runtime could’ve been a little shorter, but I have a feeling the two-hour runtime will go quick."

It's impeccably shot and edited and scored and the main protagonists in Charlize Theron (Imperator Furiosa) and Tom Hardy (Max Rockatansky) are just a badass pair. You get the feeling George Miller did everything he ever wanted in a Mad Max film with his imagination and love, and maybe ended up making the best action/chase movie of all time.

Normally sequels that were made so many years after the last movie are mostly awful, cash-grabs and made in a way that disrespects what came before. This however is a valid choice for the best Mad Max movie, has great characters and breathtaking visuals. It is a long and intense chase with character development aka self discovery. It works from start to finish and I will praise the first scene where Max monologues that it is uncertain if he or the world is more crazy. Like before Mad Max is set in an apocalyptic future after civilisation ended and the survivors struggle to survive in a dessert wasteland. It is an eaten or be eaten world. He is captured by a band of warriors called Warboys who serve the legendary Immortan Joe who is worshipped by his followers like a higher being. This is the beginning of the adventure as not everyone is happy under Immortan Joes rule. The story is amazing. Many claim it is just a long chase and it is correct. But it is entertaining, intense, full of great characters and developments. I must also praise the visuals, set, cars and costumes. It is like the “Burning Man” festival up to eleven in Mad Max style. Everything is stylish and looks amazing. All of us were majorly impressed and praised the movie. Then there is the great cast. Firstly the question if someone other than Mel Gibson can play (Mad) Max Rockatansky. The answer is yes and Tom Hardy is fantastic in his role. I never question him or his performance. Charlize Theron as Furiosa might be even better and I hope she gets a spin off. Such a great performance. Those two work well together. Then we have the hidden gem with Nicholas Hoult as Nux, Hugh Keays Byrne as impressive Immortan Joe, Nathan Jones as Rictus Erectus (Yes that is his name and I see it as Monty Python reference ;-) and the wives with Rosie Huntington Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, Zoe Kravitz and Coutney Eaton who all are strong assets. Special praise for John Howard as People Eater and the name is no mistake. The whole cast works well and I cared about them. This is the hallmark of great characters and many other movies fail in this regard. The characters and story enhance each other and made this movie so good. Of cause I must praise director George Miller who is also the writer together with Nico Lathouris and Brendan McCarthy who deserve praise too. The movie is excellent from start to finish and well crafted. Like I said the visuals are amazing and the sound track rounds it up. Overall this is probably the best movie in the franchise and a rare example of a late sequel that works. An easy recommendation for nearly everyone."

After seeing the movie, I can safely say that it is ""the greatest action movie of all time""(at least for me)!!! Miller's direction, screenplay, action sequences, musical score, cinematography, editing, costume design, visuals, and the cast's performances (particularly from Theron) were just acclaim-worthy. However, I just found hardy's performance to be a bit wooden as he just used grunts to communicate, still being in the shadows of Bane's character from The Dark Knight. Definitely in my top 3 movies of all time. Miller grandpa just proved me wrong! Those who say that it lacks a good story should need to go to film schools."

Mad Max: Fury Road not only excels as an action movie but as an allegorical tale set in a post-apocalyptical world. The movie doesn’t have a consistent frame rate, some scenes are sped up, and others slowed down to make the film’s stakes and intensity escalate. Traditionally, I dislike when the framerate is messed with, especially when it involves being slowed down. However, with Mad Max: Fury Road it is integrated so well and so thoughtfully that it is hard to notice without intentionally looking for it. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron give excellent performances. Hardy is especially good in his portrayal of the eponymous character. Mad Max: Fury Road portrays the struggles for dominance in ideologies and liquid possession (blood, water, milk). The cinematography and stunts were gritty while still being a visual spectacle. So much of what was shown in the film was built or shot practically, giving the film an air of authenticity that couldn’t be achieved, even remotely, any other way. Altogether, Mad Max: Fury Road is a thrilling faced-paced frenzy of a movie that is constantly raising its ever-high stakes. Even after the credits roll, the adrenaline is still pumping."

The leading character in this movie has to be questioned about everything for the mere fact that she is a woman. Even to the very end she has to give in to her husband's childish whim to get her freedom because basically under their laws she is mere property that has to give them what they want, as the other wife said: respect.

In fact, she generally must maintain decorum to avoid contempt of court.  And it is in the seething portraits of her silent outrage that Elkabetz (both as actress and director) truly distinguishes herself.  Still, it’s hard to believe that Dargis in the New York Times said of this film that it had “little of the courtroom dramatics that characterize mainstream legal stories.” If anything, the film seemed to me a bit overwrought at times, although the Elkabetzes are more than fair at letting the husband and the rabbinical court have their say without making fools of them—though fools they are, and though the filmmakers wisely allow the story to run close to comedy at times, in the sense that the situation is so outrageous it's almost funny."

I liked the settings, with some shots of old fashioned English towns. The dialogue felt somewhat poignant at times. While Reynolds seems quite a sensitive person, he isn't entirely likeable but I felt that the emotional performances between Vicky Krieps, who plays his partner, Alma and Daniel Day-Lewis as Reynolds seemed very believable and so its a relatively engrossing watch.  I found myself second guessing what may happen next, in terms of what direction their relationship may take. They come across as both quite vulnerable people in perhaps their own way and indeed both the instrumental music and the incidental music played lightly in the background highlighted this. I think fragility is a key theme in this film, with the link between the relationship and the soft and luxurious nature of the fabrics being the main obvious one. The main thing I liked about this film is its subtlety.

The film certainly depicts a dysfunctional relationship and I suppose it could be said to be rather (for some painfully) slow on plot but I liked the atmosphere and the general feel of it, the tenderness and so it worked for me."

Like PTA's other recent films, it's basically just a power struggle between two psychopaths, who themselves are embodiments of abstract forces. If you still struggle between understanding the difference between literal and figurative interpretation of art, probably steer clear."

458,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/phantom-thread/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,PipeC,"May 6, 2018",9,"Shockingly exquisite and overwhelming piece of art crafted by high-fashion maestros.  His newest piece of art, which aspired to six Oscars without any surprises, wickedly slips through the 1950's day-to-day characters of Daniel Day-Lewis, Vicky Krieps, and Lesley Manville: a close-minded designer, his faithful and inseparable sister-assistant and his new wife and muse. What the director and screenwriter — two in one — communicates through the aesthetics of his storytelling comprises more than a mind can get caught in one fell swoop, as it displays a dazzling commentary about loving relationships and how they can destroy each other or construct each other. As expected, the only thing our characters will swim against the tide, creating an inhabitable environment where subjugation, confrontations, and madness build a fatality barrier. The story never gets caught in muddy matters as giving a vengeful and righteous attitude to the unsubmissive lady, giving her a voice to express what goes through her mind, to express how the relationship is getting her to fly off the handle and in the end,  inexplicably, how it manages to transform her. It's time to say goodbye, Daniel Day-Lewis has bestowed one of the most forceful, intoxicating and electrifying interpretations of his career for his fervent followers, the definitive show of one of the real egregious artists of the last century.  Well-spoken **** is who concludes his filmography, the designer by which the British actor had to undergo a hard preparation process in order to portray with honesty and truthfulness the unspoken pain and personal demand of a man who can only fall in love with his threads. It was a huge surprise to hear about the nomination the Academy gave Lesley Manville thanks to her role as the nosy and demurely envious Cyril, a  character that, although is important for the development of the central conflict and shows the unspeakable talent of the actress, never gets to stay the necessary time on screen to justify tremendous recognition. Perhaps, the truly inexplicable thing is that, even if she performs a restrained and applaudable work, the real laurels and props should go to Vicky Krieps, because it's such the scope of her interpretation that the scenes in which both ladies share screen are pure fire. Turning to the matter in hand, Krieps is the absolute femme-fatale of the film. Her powerhouse performance is rebellious and caustic, emotional and fun when she should, never melodramatic; each line of the screenplay comes out delicately from her mouth, using as means a character who doesn't want to lose freedom at the expense of an unsolicited recognition and toxic love.

And of course, the visual section leaves anyone speechless. A close-up, the camera slowly moves away from Alma's face, who, tranquil, narrates how unconditional and true was her love for the designer. Having as a background an incandescent bonfire coloring her skin of a crackling orange lost in blackness, it's how opens one of the most aesthetic and brilliantly crafted movies I have seen on the big screen.   Obviously, it's primarily Mark Tildesley's production design that jumps out at you, which facilitates the staging of a discredited cinematographer who, without expecting, turns out to be the one who directs and writes, a man who truly put, soul, mind and heart to a memorable work. The colors of the landscapes, the textures of the dresses, the coincidence of the elements and the setting allow the construction of scenes that now are in my mind, without intention of leaving. Among the endless delicacy of vintage beauties, There are specifically two with which I'll remember the film: the first défilé de mode in which Alma models a gorgeous dress, a phenomenal and impossible to improve moment; and **** looking for his wife at the New Year's Party, the fall of the multicolored balloons is a feat and an artistic gift full of love for cinema.

Shockingly beautiful, interestingly touching and caustically moralizing, ""Phantom Thread"" by Paul Thomas Anderson is an intense trip through the damaging relationship of two human beings consumed by hate and love, a story which you will only be willing to enjoy if you know the characteristics and constraints of the works from this warhorse. Laying on the table again the importance of women at any time, age and context, the film acts as a treatment to current global issues such as love martyrdoms, marital conflicts, abuse and human reaches. With an invaluable interpretation of Vicky Krieps and an emotional and sublime farewell to acting ****, the film benefits from the onerous and elegant high-class visuals and a passive-aggressive narrative to deliver an absorbing story, with dimensions of perfectionism as exquisite as those of the protagonist, with whom, from a personal point of view, the director/writer raises a representation of his own story; his films are the refined, detailed and tantalizing dresses."

461,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/phantom-thread/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,AndrewBurge,"Apr 14, 2018",9,"You know the phrase ""Beauty lies on the inside"". It is often used in reference to something which has an unpleasant appearance but is pleasant beneath. Well, it is the other way around with 'Phantom Thread', Paul Thomas Anderson's newest subtle portrayal of the complex dark emotions lying deep beneath us.

Indeed, this is a film which looks and sounds brilliant, sophisticated, pretentious and even luxurious. The soundtrack, while subtle and not very catchy, is present very often and at times being present only as hums and delicate occasional touches on its piano chords. But, its beauty hides complex sorrows and near masochistic principles of which, the most obvious are the ones of its lead character, Reynolds ****, a renowned dressmaker with a obsessive compulsive routine, portrayed brilliantly by the exclusive Daniel Day-Lewis. He demands absolute silence at breakfast, he cuts his nose and ear hairs with absolute precision, but what destroys him most is his obsession with his work.

Indeed, when he meets Alma, a German girl, he constantly complements her perfect form, but does he really love her, or she sees her as an idealistic model for his dresses. Well, in the end he loves her, but still under his own principles and rules. These rules are never ever set apart for anything as his sister and assistant, Cyril, a by-the-book woman is always by his side... Always!

Paul Thomas Anderson often presents the darkest human emotions and desires through subtle and disturbing acts. Yet in this movie he also masks them with visual and auditory elegance. These are slowly stripped away as we are pulled closer into their minds, like **** sorrow over the death of his mother, claiming: ""it is comforting to know the dead watch over the living. I don't find that spooky at all"". Yet the unusual love between him and Alma is decomposed as she occasionally poisons him with mushrooms just enough for him to get sick so he can care for him and be with him, Yet despite him knowing that, he does not mind. In fact he finds pleasure in it. It is an uneasy psychological game in which they engage portraying their sanity-altering self-absorbed nobility-principled line of thoughts."

‘Phantom Thread ’ might be the best film I think I have ever seen. Superb in every sense of the word. It's up there with ‘There Will Be Blood’. For the last couple of days after I watched the film, there was something about it that transcended me into a spell. It felt like a dream. An extraordinary incident was watching this a second time in one week, which is something I rarely do. Better on the second watch, if I must say. Gripped ever tighter in it’s sinister approach to love.

What could've been so boring with its subject matter of the fashion world, something I’m not personally interested in, but made it so fascinating. If you watched the trailer and think you know how things are gonna play out, you’re dead wrong.

Paul Thomas Anderson is one of my favorite directors working today and every movie he makes, just like Scorsese, I'm there. While the film making in the movie isn't anything striking, but didn't need to be. Not to say there wasn't any perfectly framed shots. The way he films cars driving was unique. There's a shot in the movie that's taken right out of ‘A Clockwork of Orange’. This guy can make movies like ‘Boogie Nights (1997)’ - A drug rush of funky disco in 1970’s California. Then makes ‘There Will Be Blood (2007)’ - A slow pace horror movie about oil drilling. And now ‘Phantom Thread (2017)’ - The most British thing ever, set in the 1950’s about fashion with shocking parallels to Hitchcock. Are you beginning to see a pattern here - The mighty 7’s.

Daniel-Day Lewis was absolutely fantastic in this movie - Yeah, what’s new. Of course this needs repeating, because he’s wonderful as the picky **** Reynolds ****. What makes him so enthralling to watch is his special ability to embody his characters down to the smallest details. Sometimes during the film, you get close up of his worn out fingers after touching fabric and you immediately know it’s real. To prepare for the role, Day-Lewis actually made a balenciaga dress from scratch. This guy is a mad genius. Without any words spoken, his reaction when people make eat too loud or irritating little noises are hilarious. If it’s true about his retirement from acting, then he picked a great way to go out. He will be missed.

A standout performance from Vicky Krieps, who plays Alma, the woman Reynolds falls for. Krieps deserves more praise for her powerful performance, as she holds her own against Day-Lewis. Both having great chemistry that’s so sweet and yet messed up. I hope we see more of her in the future.

Lesley Manville plays Cyril, the cold silent type who sniffs out trouble in The House of ****. She serves as a helping hand to Reynolds during difficult times, since both are siblings. Another surprise standout who also goes head to head with Day-Lewis and has some of the funniest lines in the movie. Her Oscar nomination was deserved.

Jonny Greenwood’s score is heaven to my ears. Listening to it feels like a warm blanket wrapped around me. One of the best things I've heard in quite a while﻿.

And of course with it being fashion, the costumes and production designs are all terrific. Mark Bridges and Mark Tildesley crafted an astonishing piece of art that breathes life on to the screen.

Something that doesn't get enough praise is the sound design. Really detailed with every door slam, movement of plates and cutlery, needles going through thread, and crust from bread.

This plays out more like a Brother’s Grimm story than a romance. Characters constantly talk about curses, superstitions and the afterlife. Brides not touching wedding dresses as fear they will never get married. Sewing hidden messages within any fabric. Reynolds sewn a piece of his deceased mother hair into the canvas of his coat, keeping her close to his heart. The story about dressmaking and the artist was never the main focus, but something more ghostly. This refers to an irresistible motion of repeating sewing until the fingers get weary, even through their work are already done. Hence the title “Phantom Thread ”.

Overall Rating: A classic chic."

But I, objectively, can't do that because it would be a bit unfair to classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane.
Honestly though, I can't say I found any faults in this movie. It's Paul Anderson's work and I already consider his Magnolia one of my must watch movies (and there was quirky AF and weird enjoyable story of Boogie Nights). It stars Daniel Day Lewis, the man who effortlessly time again slipped into so many characters and brought into narration in such a glorious way that it leaves all of us glad about cinema. And the supporting couple of Manville and Krieps are almost are as good at bringing the best out of the interactions amongst the trio as the subtle and upheaving score that hums, a bit like a phantom indeed.
There's the rating, the acting, the cast and obviously, by now, you are most likely convinced. So, here's a right proper nudge in the direction of why south of two hours of your life's time is absolutely well spent on this: It is because Phantom Thread is one of most unlikely sort of biographical story and antitheticlally, the most personal sort of biography possible. It is the story of a man who was known for his work but what really needs to be told about him is who he was and how he behaved, why he was perturbed and how it comes to a beautiful tumble down for him. While Phantom Thread is a movie on the life of Reynolds ****, who sew the best for the best to wear, but the title of the movie is almost a beguiling pun; for it is the phantom threads of His life that really get unwinded in this superlative act of storytelling.
I hope I have helped somewhat in making up your mind. And if you don't want to, 'you should eff off back to wherever you came from'."

Phantom Thread

Even though the plot has nothing out-of-the-box to offer and even though all the characters seem familiar and even though if you have seen a similar feature of this premise, it always is worth to see the world through Paul's eyes. Phantom Thread has far better editing than 'There Will Be Blood' resulting into no faults on execution and just like a slow timer the movie even though being longer than 2 hours, reaches comfortably to its climax and still being wanted more of it by the audience. Daniel makes you fall in love with a character that is utterly rude and obnoxiously self obsessed; need I say more on him, and he is supported well by Leslie and by Vicky who surprisingly has a parallel role. Paul; as mentioned earlier doesn't take any chance on execution, but what's appreciative here is his writing skills for even though being restrained in a not-so-wide and popular genre, he goes bold and stands on his ground till the last page. Phantom Thread screeches onto one's fragile heart to its vulnerability and failure that ironically defines obscured and irrelevant hope allowing audience to shift seats on a definite answer which is its core beauty."

Phantom Thread did not go the way I expected and although it took me a while to like it, the story eventually reeled me in and I became immersed in this captivating film. Not my usual kind of movie but it's Oscar season and apparently the last you'll see Daniel Day-Lewis in a movie. He's retired again so don't all gasp at once.

Daniel Day-Lewis is the renowned dress-maker Reynolds ****. Living in 1950s London, his routine life takes a change when he meets his new muse, a young woman named Alma (Vicky Krieps) yet his highly organised bachelor life is soon disrupted by Alma. We've had a couple of films this year that decide to take a weird turn in the third act and Phantom Thread certainly went off in an unexpected direction. Not your typical love story. Day-Lewis does it again, giving another brilliant performance. Perfect casting, the chemistry between Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps was exceptional. This one is definitely a slow burner so let yourselves become engrossed in the elegance of Phantom Thread. The level of care in every single shot is mesmerizing, from the cinematography, the lavish dresses and the spectacular score by Jonny Greenwood. There's no denying Day-Lewis' performance is perfect and I expect nothing less to be honest. Yet what stood out the most for me was the haunting soundtrack. Absolutely stunning, one of the best film scores in recent years and well deserving of an Oscar. Highly recommended for all you Daniel Day-Lewis/Paul Thomas Anderson fans out there."

But, again -- I repeat -- the trailers really undersell this thing. Because, in actuality, ""Phantom Thread"" is a mesmerizingly well acted and framed study in subtextually pregnant subtlety, featuring some devilishly unexpected twists and turns along the way.

The same goes for director Paul Thomas Anderson, who, like Day-Lewis, opts for quality over quantity by selectively releasing a piece of work once every 3 to 5 years.  When combined, as they've done with 'Phantom Thread' (and the second such instance following 2007's 'There Will Be Blood'), the necessity in seeing the film is given an order of magnitude greater importance.

At best, 'Phantom Thread' stands to receive a polarizing reaction from viewers.  It's a fine (I'd say perhaps even exemplary) film within the drilled-down genre of ""English-set period-piece romantic dramas.""  However, when judged from a broader perspective, the film is simply far less captivating than either Day-Lewis' or Anderson's prior work, and the rather esoteric ending leaves audience members wishing the two had dedicated their respective time and effort to another pursuit."

It seems to me that Phantom Thread is a more accessible film than Magnolia, but you can still have the same problem with it as with the frog rain or perhaps any Paul Thomas Anderson film. I found Phantom Thread fascinating, and the acting splendid. It’s a film about greatness (in a minor art called fashion) and obsession, which may be what you need to be great in anything. It’s also about how people choose to live their lives – or maybe it’s not really a choice. It’s a fascinating film, and I enjoyed it."

His portrayal of London dressmaker Reynolds **** proves no exception. On the other hand, I found the whack ending to this movie to be far from believable, and consequently insufficient to salvage a film that is most easily labeled as a long-winded character study.

The film is set is 1950’s London.  It’s time in which social rank and class snobberies are still quite in vogue.   Kudos to director Paul Thomas Anderson for his subtlety in this regard, and avoidance of a lot of overt explanations about the time, place and social class structure of the time, and leaving it to the viewer to figure out.  **** is portrayed as a man who is totally self-absorbed.  His work is his life.  He demands perfection out of everyone around him.  He has zero capacity for indulging the needs or desires of others.  His clients are European high-society and royalty, but he does not socialize with them.  He has no friends; only the memory of his deceased mother to sustain him.  It’s a life that appears to be full on the surface but, in fact, is mostly empty.   It’s been reduced to a repeating cycle in which **** works all hours of the day and night until he reaches the point of exhaustion.  Once he recovers, he starts the cycle over again.  The only time anyone can tell if he’s happy is when he is ordering a big breakfast.

**** is not homosexual, but neither is he deeply physically or emotionally attracted to women.  Instead, he is attracted to women who have a certain body type that meet his ideal standard for fitting into the dresses that he creates.   When they later fail to meet up with his social and cultural standards (such as when they make too much noise while eating), he judges them inferior and becomes bored with them.

Alma is a waitress in a restaurant.  Her accent gives her away as an immigrant.  Here again, director Paul Thomas Anderson wisely avoids overtly calling attention to their different social statuses.  **** is attracted to her because shape.  She’s flattered by his attention but thinks she can engage him on her terms, which succeeds only in annoying him.   **** begins to lose interest and mocks her but, for reasons that are unclear, doesn’t dismiss her.   It is at this point that the movie begins to lose credibility.  What she does to him next in retaliation is beyond forgivable but, bizarrely, **** interprets her actions as true love.  Beyond that, I cannot tell you more without spoiling the movie.  Suffice it to say that the ending feels entirely out of character with the rest of the movie.  To my mind, it’s vaguely reminiscent of Kathy Bates in Misery, and Isabella Rossellini in Blue Velvet."

This movie is like a perfectly executed standup routine delivered by the world's most unassuming comedian. I'll be laughing about this one for years to come.

Luckily, Phantom Thread manages to be much more than that. Shot with spherical lenses, Paul Thomas Anderson's film hearkens back to an era of film-making of decades past. The muted color scheme manages to draw attention to itself, though not in a gratuitous manner. It goes without saying that the film's set design and costuming is breathtakingly beautiful. That is not to say however, that Phantom Thread serves as a mere technical spectacle alone. The composition of each frame is so meticulously designed, that is starts to burrow into one's mind far after the credits roll. Day-Lewis delivers a performance for the ages, in a role that would be a lifetime achievement in acting excellence for any other actor. The role is Reynolds ****, an enigmatic fashion designer whose intense attention to detail is matched only by his austere nature. Having a Freudian obsession with his deceased mother, the perennial bachelor meets Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress at a hotel he dines at early in the film, whom he takes  in as a model to pose for his dresses (The dresses themselves have an odd sort of aesthetic functionality to them. They elevate the wearer in a mental sense, giving them a regal authority in the way they carry themselves). Alma's presence is both welcome to the distant designer, and an intrusion of his work process. However, to simply summarize the film's plot points would do it a great disservice. Johnny Greenwood's continuing collaboration with Anderson has yet again proven fruitful. With its haunting strings, and melodic piano tones, the score is deeply immersive, and enriching. Day-Lewis doesn't take on characters, he hurtles himself at them, inhabiting their every idiosyncrasy to ludicrous detail. Anderson lets the camera roll, and Day-Lewis takes over. One imagines that Day-Lewis will be hoisting up that golden trophy come March, but it'd be an all too paltry of a recognition, given the work he's done here."

Letitia Wright’s performance is easily one of my favorite of the year and I really hope that she gets recognition for it. Every other performance here is great to. There is not one bad performance in this film. Everyone does an outstanding job and it seems like this film will get that recognition for its performances. The writing is top notch. I can tell from his writing that McQueen is interested in telling this story and the way he writes his dialogue is perfect. His direction is also very well done too. This man knows what he is doing. The story follows 9 African American’s put on trial for a protest that was squashed by the police and made to look like a riot. A lot of this film is in court and usually, movies that primarily focus on court cases don’t do a lot for me but this was special. I was always engaged in these scenes. We get to see a different side of the police around the world, not just in America and it’s infuriating to see how grossly the police were in this scenario. My main issue with the film was that sometimes, the cinematography felt a little stale. Most of my issues are with the beginning of the film in fact. It’s just not as interesting as the rest of the film. I’m not saying that the first part was boring but I was way more investing in everything after the beginning of the film.

Hmm ... I don't watch romantic movies, but I liked this one.
Let's start with the biggest white ball: music and cinematography. I never realized how beautiful the black and white films are. I do not know if this movie was shot more nicely than Roma ... I think I like more Cold War. Helps (in my opinion) the aspect ratio of 4:3. The songs are great. I think I'm going to listen to the soundtrack again.
Another white ball is acting. Am I the only one that thinks Joanna Kulig looks like Jennifer Lawrence?
And now comes the bad part ... I did not really care about the characters, I do not know why. There are some moments when I should feel sad but ... I could not. I think I would have given it a 95/100 if I had been interested ... I think it's my problem, I do not know.

Frase pronunciada por la actriz Ingrid Bergman es básicamente la esencia de esta historia, en donde la belleza de cada cuadro dice mucho más que el dialogo.

El director polaco Pawel Pawlikowski que había mostrado su maestría con Ida (2013), regresa trayendo un romance imposible que tiene de telón de fondo la guerra fría, Pawlikowski cuenta una apasionado romance imposible entre dos personas de diferentes orígenes y temperamentos. Desde la primera escena de esta cinta el espectador queda hipnotizado por la belleza de la imagen en blanco y negro que resalta y contrasta momento de fuerte sentimentalismo sobrio y elegante, que desespera en momentos, que se acompaña perfectamente con la música seleccionada, que parece haber sido creada especialmente para la película.

La película comienza a fines de los 40, vemos una recreación fiel de las distintas épocas por las que la película pasa, mostrando por medio de la música el paso del tiempo. La historia va avanzando, vemos reconciliaciones y reencuentros, siempre hermosos, pero en el fondo sabemos que no durara, nos volvemos participes de la desesperación de dos personas profundamente enamoradas que por los obligaciones laborales y los problemas que se vivían en la época no logran consolidar su romance.

Simply because the romantic relationship between the two main characters is not clearly illustrated and surprisingly very shallow. I even couldn't understand why their love is so strong; why these people are so stuck to each other. I would have been more convinced that they fell in love with each other if their love was at-first-sight kind of love. But their love is even more corny and superficial than I could have ever imagined. They continue to move all the time and make love and argue, while there is not enough emotional heft to their relationship. The movie never even delves into the romantic aspect; it only displays the parts that unit the ""lovers"" before driving them apart again. And I honestly wasn't invested neither in the characters, nor their relationship and the obstacles they face over the years. It comes as no surprise that the movie becomes boring at some point. Yes, that means that I wasn't bored per se all the way through the movie, and that's for some reasons.

For starters, the cinematography is simply awe-inspiring! Every scene is one of breathtaking beauty. The black-and-white color style creates a romantic and nostalgic atmosphere that tricked me that I would enjoy a love story that fits its setup. Cold War hands down deserves an Oscar for best cinematography, despite the fact that there are many 2018 films I've seen that look astonishing. Cold War has a truly striking visual aesthetic.

In the beginning of the movie, Pawel Pawlikowski skillfully showed us the life in Poland after the war and the folklore culture. The nostalgic sense and the illustration of another culture in another era are so pure and genuine. Let alone the mesmerizing singing scenes that serve as small feasts for the senses.

As for the ""political"" territory that the movie tackles, it's equally superficial and flat as the romantic aspect. Nevertheless, I was surprised that I cared about this ""capitalist world"" more than I cared about the romance between Zula and Wiktor, considering the fact I'm not into politics at all.

Both the two leads, Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot, elevated their colorless characters by delivering powerhouse performances that were enough to make me not hate Zula and Wiktor.

I was prepared to see a masterpiece, and now I really feel that I've been cheated. Cold War left me COLD! And I'm thoroughly underwhelmed by it.

Beautifully shot in black and white, this bittersweet tale pays fitting homage to European art films of the 1950s and '60s with a narrative somewhat reminiscent of the French drama ""Betty Blue"" (1986). However, after a strong beginning, the picture begins to meander somewhat toward the middle, as if the director didn't quite know how to bridge the opening to a conclusion that he already had in mind. It feels like all the makings **** film are here but that they don't quite gel as well as they might have in the finished product.

The acting is exceptionally good and completely believable. And Pawlikowski always seems to find an interesting “angle” from which to shoot a scene, which enriches the film, but also is sometimes a distraction, at least during the first half of the film after which you are so caught up in the story that such details don't matter anymore, but the passion of the lovers does."

Why, then, two perfectly balanced, happily married people, like us, experience strong connection with those two, feeling their every raw emotion?
It has to do with the mastery of the filmmaker, Pawel Pawlikowski, Polish director who made ""Ida"" (best Foreign Movie in 2013). The movie is dedicated to his parents and loosely based on their love life. They separated and got back together three times, leaving back their new spouses.
 
Music carries the whole film, from folk Polish songs and dances to soviet-era Stalinist songs to jazz, it helps to create authentic feeling of post-War Europe with the main theme of one forbidden love (""Two Hearts"").

it is adequately infinite..

Pawlikowski’s writhing response to politically and personally challenged era lops your thinking and puts an honest mirror in front of the screen whose parallel world is equally soothing to encounter as it is inedible to swallow. Despite of being fueled by pathos ideology, it is adequately infinite. The general subjective method is bizarrely genius and jaggedly on mark, that it gives you an abyss feeling which is cathartic to the core. Your nerves pops out with some beautifully shot bright scenes; jaw dropping cinematography, that even though, is black and white, it is immensely appealing.

The structure of the script is weaved out to keep you enmeshed in its poetic world, addition to that, it rhymes. Pawlikowski’s passion for music is the soul reason how he fills in those tiny gaps between sequences and somehow it grows out to become its core strength. To cohere such a wide concept within two characters, is an example of fine writing skill. Ticking for only 90 minutes, Pawlikowski sufficiently pours out his intentions on each frame. If the initial stage is general and contains the dirty politics and answers some challenging questions, the latter one is so personal that you can practically sense those characters around you.

It is a pleasure to watch three dimensional characters come out of the screen, as a character quips once in the movie, “..love is timeless..” Pawlikowski proves his passion for storytelling on a much larger scale than ever. Ranking each other, as the story develops, the characters are purely humane and for the sake of the explanation, the makers keep them unfiltered; their rawness is what attracts us. Kot has a reserved act to follow, troubled but mellow. His character needs to speak through eyes, his underdog character has to be calculated by himself on each scene and he keeps his end of the promise. On the other hand, Kulig gets an expressive one.

It doesn’t suggest that it isn’t layered, in fact hers is much more simpler, wider and sensible; moody yet justified. Horns clashing on screen, both the actors brims their entire performance with flow that is hard to stop. It might be set on practical times, but the characters are so not pragmatic. Their superpower makes them stand alone in the crowd quite early in the movie. Their affection towards each other is impenetrable, even the conflicts weaved out by themselves fails to do so, the purity is both harrowing and mesmerizing.

This mighty old crown of genre that Pawlikowski has held on his head has actually been passed over to many a great filmmakers, but only few of them has got it right, personally, I feel it is more romantic than it is dramatic, sweep off the political distraction, the fragile poem residing in the core of this tale is waiting devastatingly to be read. The vertiginous concept that it attempts to convey in the most possibly simpler terms is what fuels this romance. Zimna Wojna is actually confected from a single pure emotion, the title won’t be suffice, neither will the storytelling be."

En ese  tiempo ella vivía en un campamento de equitación, junto con tres jóvenes. La señora G, su entrenadora de equitación, una mujer disciplinada y guapa. El señor G, fue la ""pareja"" (como ella lo llamó durante mucho tiempo) de Jenny cuando ella tenia 13.

This is the only issue I have with The Tale, but it's definitely a grave one. I won't be lying if I said that sometimes I couldn't even tell what was Jennifer, our protagonist, wanted to know, or what she was trying to discover. All I wanted is a specific aim, and that shouldn't have been hard to achieve. But there are so many things that can redeem this film. All the performances are great; Elizabeth Debicki is wonderful as Jennifer's riding teacher, and I didn't even realize that she has these masterful acting abilties. Laura Dern is very good as Jennifer, but I think Isabelle Nélisse who played the same character at the age of 13 is the real star in this movie. She excellently balanced between the innocence and the cruelty; as the movie mixed between the past and the present.

By the way, this is one of the most important things that made this movie so intense. Jennifer Fox, as a director, used the technique of mixing the past with the present to create some sort of an unsettling atmosphere that made this movie so difficult to watch. Also, there is a particular scene in which this technique was used, that I consider as the best scene of the movie, and one of the best movie scenes this year so far.

Another great decision the director made is retelling Jennifer's story every time she discovers something new about her past. That made me that every new piece of information is like a clever twist.

There are plenty of moments that will make you feel nervous. Moments that will put you into Jennifer's shoes, and make you keep wondering what this character will do to her? what this character's answer will be like? Is this is even the truth? As you can see there are many great things in terms of the directing, and that means that Jennifer Fox's directorial debut is very successful. But it's her writing abilities that need to be developed.

The Tale

A wide range of such genre features are created that focuses on the fragile aspects of the society, but only few of them gets it right on both - the cinematic and infomercial - the ways and maintains the perfect balance. It is visually beautiful with impressive camera work and cinematography that unfortunately isn't supported to that extent on technical aspects like background score and editing. There are few cringe worthy scenes; which is obvious considering the premise, that took lots of gut to pull it off on screen by the makers. The writing is strong, sharply accurate and ballsy that ups the ante and the energy of the cinema on screen as it doesn't flinch on visiting unexpected places and tell its own story. Jennifer Fox; has done a plausible work on writing the script but an even more tremendous job on executing such an eerie feature with such confidence. The character's perspective as it struggles on recollecting the occurred events is brilliantly depicted that proves not only the excellence on writing but the wittiness on the tricks and treats installed by the makers for the audience. The feature scores majestically on performance where everyone is giving their best especially Laura Dern who is a revelation in this masterpiece and is supported by a great cast like Elizabeth Debicki, Chelsea Alden and Jason Ritter. The structure of the plot isn't one's usual melodrama that spends its time on grieving and instead takes action through its own methodology and is delivered by some amazing heartfelt conversations.

I won't say a great deal, plot wise, as I'm not sure quite what I could say that would entirely make it make sense, frankly - its certainly a quirky film. I liked the moments where Patersons partner, Laura (played well by Golshifteh Farahani) is shown being creative at home, getting satisfaction from perhaps seemingly basic household tasks. I liked the dog, Marvin - he's a cute English Bulldog who features in a few scenes. I wouldn't say this is a great film - I liked it in one way and in another way it felt a bit too pretentious in a way. I suppose its typical Jim Jarmusch fare really. Oh and also, I did like that when Paterson gives voice over/narrative reading out the various poems he has in his mind, said lines appear on screen - some are more thoughtful, perhaps, than others. Its a relatively interesting film, a little bland/quirky perhaps in a not brilliant way but in another way its fairly good, so I'm giving it a 7 out of 10 rating, for the more poignant and touching lines of poetry. There aren't too many films that feature a main character keen on expressing him through poetry and keeping it to himself for the most part and I myself do (or certainly did) write poetry every now and then, so I could somewhat relate to that aspect.

If it sounds of interest, then its probably worth a watch, especially for fans of Adam Driver, who plays the main (titular) character but it is also a bit of an acquired taste perhaps - certainly if your looking for a big laugh type comedy or an exciting watch, then this may well disappoint.

The time Jim Jarmusch has struck back. He does not make films often, but those he makes are not easily forgettable. I don't think people hate his films, especially the grown ups. They know how hard the real life is and contents this filmmaker use for his flicks aren't much different. But the thing is, in his style, adding a slight fun, romantic, poetic, all together works so well. I still remember how I become his fan after watching 'Stranger Than Paradise'.

As usual, he wrote the story for this film. Even if he'd to borrow from another source, the screenplay is generally his. For this film, it was original & that's what worked out awesomely. But he had to borrow some poems from his favourite poet, Ron Padgett. A great team work, because when their work came together, the film became a masterpiece. It was nothing less than any literature, for sure. Definitely this film should turn into a book. The readers deserve their own imagination of this tale.

This is the story of a man's life in a week's time. Starts from Monday and ends on next Monday. So, his name's Paterson, a bus driver from the city of Paterson. A happily married man, & love his profession. In the meantime, he's a poet. He has kept a book where he writes his poems, especially during his lunch time, even in the small breaks when he gets. His mind's always filled with thoughts. Chanting words, verses.

His inspirations are the places he goes through his bus & the strangers who ride in his bus. Their each others conversation about their lives & experiences is his motivation. His wife is an interesting character too. Sadly, she wasn't focused as much as he was. Though there're enough scenes to enjoy the role. But I think she deserves her solo film, from another angle, about her life, her hobby which her husband backs.

It's a simple, normal life. Without much trouble, a peaceful life the most people would ask for. The film isn't everything about him. But he's the centre of the story. When other, one time characters enter the screen. It's because of his presence around them. Hence some interesting facts revealed. Just like our life when we ride a public transport where we come in to contact with many passengers coming & going in different stops. But all the above, what they talk, which we, everybody in the bus listen without hesitation. Paterson is a person who learns every day out of that.

❝Poetry in translation is like taking a shower with a raincoat on.❞

His other activity's walking his dog out at every night. It's an opportunity for him to mix with some friends at the pub he had made with frequent visits. The place which has its own story as the film progresses. So all these stuffs keeps repeating every day like what we call a mechanical life. But Paterson is neither enjoying it nor depressed over. He usually does best out of the given time & place. The difference is, not every day're same. Even a slight change in order of activity brings a new thing in. His wife insists him to publish his works. But the narration strikes with an unexpected twist before the end.

I have said many times when I liked the films I've watched that they are so poetic. But it's very rare to find a film from top to bottom being very poetic. Recently I saw one, in fact, two from Japan known as 'Little Forest' duology. And now this one. Particularly if you love poetry or if you're yourself a poet, then this is a must see. Surely you would love it. As well as a good film to gift to any such person you know in your life. Believe me, this film is like a wine bottle. As it gets older, it'll turn the best. I've already changed my stance twice & rated better every time. I consider it is a bit low rated right now. But only time will answer to that.

For me, it is the director's top 3 films. I have seen Adam Driver in many films, he's not considered a solo lead actor, because of marketing purpose. But he's really good which proved in this flick. So it is his best performance I have seen so far. He really took the driving classes to learn drive the bus to perfect his character. That's the dedication the creator of the film expects from his cast. How much I loved it means, I'm eager for a sequel, despite knowing this kind of films are one-off. Otherwise, I'll be happy if the director and him join the hands once more time for a new project.

Very slow moving tale. But not a boring film. If I had watched it when I was a teenager, I don't think I would have felt similarly. From middle aged people to the older ones, they are the target audience. In order to see and feel what this film reveals, one must have experience in real life. Hence, not all the youngsters, particularly the teenagers would thumb up. In my world, this kind of films is the Oscar worthy. I would have surely nominated the film, as well as the director and the lead actor. So by now you would have learnt what my final word could be. Recommended!

541,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/paterson/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Spangle,"Feb 25, 2017",8,"A slice of life film, Paterson depicts one week (Monday to Sunday) in the life of Paterson (Adam Driver) who lives in Paterson, New Jersey with his girlfriend Laura (Golshifteh Farahani), his dog Marvin, works as a bus driver for the city, and goes to a bar run by Doc (Barry Shabaka Henley). Aside from the weekend, his days are relatively the same. He wakes up, gets breakfast, goes to work, has a conversation with a fellow employee who's life is in shambles, he drives, he goes home, he has dinner, he walks Marvin, he goes to the bar, and then repeat. Yet, much like life, things change every time. To the untrained eye, particularly when it is your own eye, life barely changes from day-to-day. Capturing this beauty and showing how it changes, Paterson is a simple and down-to-earth film that plays like a poem about life and all of its odd idiosyncrasies.

Paterson is, above all, a film about people. That is the biggest change from the day-to-day. Every morning, Paterson wakes up next to Laura. Every morning, their sleeping position is different. Every morning, he eats breakfast. Every morning, he is eating something different, sitting somewhere new, or the dog is somewhere new. Every morning, he goes to work. Every day, he encounters new people, new sights in the city, new conversations, and new incidents. Every day, he goes home. Every day, Laura made something new for dinner, painted something, or purchased something new. Every day, he walks to the bar with Melvin. Every day, he sees somebody new or has a conversation with a stranger. Every day, he goes to the bar. Every day, he sees new people who are new or familiar faces to him and the conversations or situations are different. Though, on the surface, Paterson is a film about seven days that just repeat themselves like Groundhog Day, each day is vibrantly different. It is a film that celebrates the mundane nature of life, but also the subtle changes that make each day feel new. It is not merely a world defined by the fact that the sun rises every morning and sets every evening. The times of the sunrise and sunset even change each day, symbolic of the slight and practically unnoticeable change of each day. We have our routines, especially Melvin, but things will not always go to plan and things will often change from the day-to-day. Jarmusch's picture is tribute to that and a simple and structurally unique poem to that simplicity.

Beautifully acted by Adam Driver, the role is incredibly reserved as he plays the quite and meditative Paterson. Constantly writing in his secret notebook of poems, he writes about simple things like a box of matches. He finds the poetry in life and pens poems based upon that simple beauty. Largely not emotive, he is a man that simply goes through life and likes what he likes and what he likes most is poetry. Yet, his reserved nature even applies to his love. He does not read his poems to his girlfriend, he does identify himself as an aspiring poet to people he meets, and he does not want to share his poems with the world. Writing the poems is enough for him, nothing more and nothing less. He is content with his life in Paterson, driving a bus, living with his girlfriend, and going to the bar. His poetry, as it stands, is all he wants it to be. Every inch of his life, even his girlfriend and her obsession with black-and-white, is what he wants it to be. His aspirations are to wake up as himself the next day and to do what he likes, even if it does not conform with the aspirations and dreams of society.

Yet, what sets Paterson apart is its complete lack of cinematic aspirations. In many ways, Jarmusch's film is like Paterson himself. As Laura pushes him to release his poems, he half-heartedly promises to make copies of the poems. Whenever the audience thinks the film is setting up something via foreshadowing or about to reach a scene of unspeakable tension, the film refuses. With a street tough warning Paterson about how Melvin might get dog jacked, Paterson talking to an aspiring rapper who seems oddly intrigued by the dog, Everett (William Jackson Harper) bringing a gun to the bar, and Paterson's bus breaking down, it feels like the film is constantly foreshadowing or introducing palpable drama. The most common fear is regarding the dog and that fear could be felt in the theater. Left outside the bar as Paterson drinks and pals around, we are constantly left with the belief that Melvin will be stolen. But, inevitably, the screen fades to black and he begins the next day next to Laura in bed. There is even a scene where the door is open and Melvin runs out, but it is shown to be merely part of his routine as he immediately scampers back in. Jarmusch even openly mocks his audience in regards to the bus incident. With it breaking down due to an electical problem, passengers immediately ask if it will blow up. The film seems to play into this by having Paterson tell everybody to stay a good distance away from the bus."
542,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/paterson/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DirigiblePulp,"Feb 24, 2017",8,"The beauty in the routine of everyday life. The most Japanese American movie ever made. Paterson is shaped like a poem, with its repeating structure of slight everyday variation, and suggests that, maybe, if we stopped to think about it once in a while, we could see the beauty in most things. Everything isn't poetry until we stop to see it as such, to think about it as such, to express it as such.

This is the most pleasant of films, filled with likable characters and pleasing conversation. You don't really want it to end, much like life, and it's not always the most thrilling -- except when it is, sometimes at the most inopportune of times -- much like life. Paterson and Laura have a perfectly dichotomous relationship -- representing the need for balance, for helping to see the world from a different point of view -- with Driver and Farahani having nice chemistry.

Paterson doesn't care if his (or its) poetry is any good. What matters is the strive for it and the need for it. Poetry doesn't have to be elitist, dense, high-brow, etc. It can be what you make of it. Maybe that's too simplistic, but this is just the one point of view, of many."

Adam Driver's equally subdued performance marks yet another worthwhile performance of his and the film's themes of love, poetry, etc. are interesting enough. However, I was really quite surprised at the lack of conflict in the film. Too often it seemed a little too simple and straightforward both story-wise and for the characters. Overall, despite its over-simplicity and quiet nature, it's still a film that made me ponder and think a bit and Driver makes fine work of it as well."

We watch his daily routine: he gets up, drives his bus (and pens his poetry), spends the evening with his devoted wife, walks the dog and drops by a local bar for a beer. This is a low-key character study from deadpan director Jim Jarmusch. While it's always interesting, almost nothing happens…just observations of his life and love. (The dog provides some delightful lighter moments.) Driver's soulful eyes dominate his sensitive portrayal and the final scenes are truly moving. Jarmusch's quiet observations and poetic montages combined with quietly compelling situations create a sweetly affecting cinematic poem."

The story has a slow and deliberate pace, much like the bus driven by Adam Driver's character as he watches the world unfold before him, using what he sees and hears and feels as inspiration for the poems he writes in his coveted notebook.

It's a role that is probably the closest we'll see to the real Adam Driver, representing the continuation of a remarkable streak of films that are among the best being produced by Hollywood today.

There are times in the movie when one desires a greater evolution of the characters, or settings, or plot, but that feeling runs against the grain of the film itself.  The point is that life is repetitive, and the only way to get better at it is through consistency and persistence."
548,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/paterson/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,KaptenVideo,"Jan 23, 2017",9,"Paterson is the name of the city where the main character (Adam Driver) lives, and also his name. He is a man of constant simple routine: works as a bus driver, writes poetry to his secret note book, goes home to his beloved wife, eats dinner with her, takes her dog for a walk and goes to have a beer at the same bar every night. That’s it.

The legendary writer-director Jim Jarmusch only releases a new movie after every 2-4 years but when it happens, it’s always worth the wait. Yes, his unique style of storytelling is boring and frankly incomprehensible to those equating cinema – especially American – with quick thrills. But if you happen to be able to stay on the same page with him, you will be happy to spend two hours watching how seemingly nothing or little happens story-wise.

Jarmusch is all about details and how little things make bigger things meaningful – both in life and on screen. One can’t just watch his movie, it would probably become boring long before the end. You need this specific meditative mood, be ready to delve into what’s presented and forget the real time in your real world. Jarmusch’s stories are slooooooow, they are not so much about specific events and dialogue than the lead characters’ state of mind or chosen way of being, which is often illustrated by recurring events and details. In this context, some of his projects are „easier“, such as „Paterson“, and some one you wouldn’t really imagine yourself watching twice, even if you liked it, such as 2009’s „The Limits of Control“.

Having called „Paterson“ one of Jarmusch’s „easier“ movies doesn’t mean that it’s mainstream-friendly. It’s still very much a slow, meditative experience where little happens, basically the main event is shown multiple times with little variations, there’s not much dialogue or many different characters. Also, I did not symphatize with Paterson’s unconditional admiration for her wife. And I loved the movie! Goes to my personal „best of 2016“ list for sure.

So, how did Jarmusch take a story about almost nothing and make it one of the best-reviewed American movies of last year? Like stated above, the god is in the details. Jarmusch’s style of presenting everything – creating mise en scène to put it in technical terms – is so captivating, efficient and powerful that I can’t couldn’t help but watch with interest from the very first seconds. Every little thing can be interesting or, for example, funny, just because how Jarmusch has decided to show it. And nothing on screen is meaningless or trivial. He is not the only famous American director with a penchant of concentrating on fascinating details instead of extensive story and dialogue – Wes Anderson is pretty popular, too – but he sure is one of the great masters of it. And somehow it works for creating and maintaining suspense through long two hour movie (OK, for this, the music is used efficiently too). If you like „Paterson“, you like it just because how it feels. It’s not flashy in any way, and there are no big „Oscar moments“. The result is very much like life itself: it has a deeper spiritual message but one that is not carried to you on a silver platter. If you choose not to uncover or recognize it, you will not get it. And there’s nothing wrong with not getting it either. You get it when you’re ready. If not, then you’re not ready, and hearing about it wouldn’t help you. (The hint is in the beginning of this review, by the way.)

The actors are part of the puzzle, not meant to stand out specifically. But the performances are good and Adam Driver as Paterson is a rising star for sure. I love him from HBO’s „Girls“ already and am happy to see him now having leading roles in movies also. He’s also Kylo in the new „Star Wars“ trilogy if somebody cares about that."

Paterson is one of the most relatable, sweet, and charming movies I've seen this year. While the story is simply and straight forward on paper, but the final result is quite unique. Before seeing the movie, I've heard nothing but great things about this movie, even at Cannes it got excellent feedback. And boy, it didn't disappoint.

Adam Driver once again knocks it out of the park in this movie. By giving a very quite and kindhearted performance that's quiet something. He's in everything recently and I'm glad an actor at he's range is getting the work he deserves.

I would view this movie as kind of a character study. For example: Paterson main interest is poetry, as it is he's escapism, because he lives a simply life and usually dose the same routine everyday. He's a talented man that's stuck in a dull life. There's many times in the movie where he will be sitting at a bar (alone) and he will be watching other people and you can clearly see there's something going on in their lives. Or his friends would come up to him and talk about their day, which has a lot going compared to him. It brilliantly captures loneliness and the necessity of the main character. Even through he is married and has friends, he still feels isolated.

Jim Jarmusch wrote and directed this movie so brilliantly that I can't imagine any other director doing this. What's so interesting about Jarmusch direction is that he focus more on mood and character development than anything else. And that's why I felt the main character isolation and futility. The strongest part of ""Paterson"" (putting aside the acting) is Jarmusch screenplay, as the film is heavy dialogue. The poetry in the movie is so well written and wasn't terribly force like other movies when trying to be poetic. Excellent work Jim Jarmusch. Haven't seen his other work yet, but will do soon day.

Overall rating: ""Paterson"" is pure poetry in the most wonder way. I must admit, it left a big dumb smile on my face after it was over. The movie might be slow for some people and I can understand that, but there's something in this movie that I think everyone can appreciate."

The performances in this movie are great especially considering how young a lot of the cast is. The look of the film is unique which is quite amazing since it is set in such a dull and uninteresting environment. The cinematographer did an excellent job.

The film requires physical performances from its cast; dialogue is sparse, and often we are thrown in the middle of conversations that put context to the plot. We see the characters practice their craft and move through the community center that these young, inner city kids occupy. The camera stays on the main character, Toni, who is trying to move from the lone, masculine sport of boxing to a communal, feminine dance team. The creators used non-professional actors to give the film authenticity, while still providing a hint of strangeness in the plot. While it didn't completely hold my attention the whole time, it is rich with subtext while providing a complete and special vision."
559,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-fits/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Indiefilmlover,"Jul 1, 2016",9,"In an era of movies dominated by remakes, reboots and generic by-the-numbers filmmaking, it is so refreshing to see a movie like, ""The Fits."" Unlike typical Hollywood fare, ""The Fits"" assumes the audience has some intelligence and doesn't need every detail to be explained completely. The film also utilizes a distinctive visual style that immerses you into the world of the protagonist. It also sets the location in a very specific place (Cincinnati, Ohio).

The film is essentially a character study of Toni (played by newcomer Royalty Hightower), a tom boy who spends her free time in the boxing gym with her brother. During one of her training sessions, she becomes intrigued by a dance company that practices nearby. In a typical Hollywood movie, the story would be about how Toni struggles to blend in with the group and would culminate with her helping the girls win the big competition, but not here. Like many films of the American New Wave or early West African Cinema, ""The Fits"" is less concerned about the machinations of a conventional Hollywood narrative and focuses instead on Toni's journey of self-discovery.

Throughout the movie, the camera focuses almost entirely on Toni. This is most evident in the dance rehearsal scenes where the adult characters in particular, are kept mostly in the background. A viewer's appreciation for this film is directly proportional to how interested you are in the life of an 11 year old black girl. If you are, the film is immensely satisfying and thought-provoking. If not, you'll quickly become bored and frustrated with the movie.

A lot has been made of Royalty Hightower's performance. She is very photogenic and meets the physical and emotional demands of the material very well. However, she is not the only reason to watch this movie. Alexis Neblett as Beezy, one of the new girls with dance company is also a joy to watch. She brings an energy and youthful exuberance to her performance, that one doesn't often see in standard Hollywood fare. Significantly, the kids in ""The Fits"" look and act like real youngsters, not a Hollywood version of them. At least some of the credit must go to first-time director Anna Rose Holmer to eliciting some fine performances from her cast.

Another striking aspect about ""The Fits"" is its score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans. Minimalist in many respects, the score is highly effective and even menacing at times.   Overall, the film is technically well-made.

""The Fits"" is clearly not for every one. If the mention of the latest Hollywood reboot excites you or if you're looking for a movie with predictable plot points, you're best to look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for a film that allows you to think and feel for yourself, ""The Fits"" is definitely worth a look. Just remember to approach the film with an open mind."

Minding The Gap

Liu's documentary on a diverse group of people that are connected with one heart pumping passion is not only an essential eye opening subject to explore upon but is also a gripping and compelling family drama. As far as the clips of all the skateboard stunts are concerned, there is no need to look back. But one of the main reason why they work so smoothly on narration, is when the makers need a visual medium while someone is narrating, these clips help immensely for them to link all the parallel tracks perfectly. Divided into three tracks and three lives, the one that connects you with majorly is Johnson's or at least it did to me.

Since his track does not stand exceptionally alone, one can connect on multiple level with his life. On the other hand, the truly dramatic or cinematic of all, is of Liu's which is so sharp and powerfully executed that the emotions may rumble you down to tears. And the rest of the space is taken by Johnson who has his own dodgy issues where the other related to him too gets to factor in effectively, a fair and balanced trial put on by the maker.

Another primary reason it speaks more to the common people, is because they keep them grounded as much as possible, despite of having an exceptional life, the tiny details on their routines and light and breezy equation with someone, is how they easily get under your skin. Liu; the director, himself has done a splendid work on foliating the drama that they went through, it can be really difficult to project your own story with such conviction especially without any manipulation or milking too much of the material. Minding The Gap is the most balanced documentary possible, it sticks by its job, the genre never overtakes the content and the drama communicates with you."

What starts out seemingly like a skate-culture doc turns into a heart-felt and powerful meditation on abuse among families.  All three main characters are extremely sympathetic.  The way it all comes together - the way it invites you into the thesis - and how the filmmaker explains to his subjects what the doc is truly about -  is masterful.

The events that unfold around this family are undoubtedly some of the hardest to watch I have ever seen and probably will ever see. This is in part due to the focus on innocent children effected by the war shown in often gruesome, uncensored, horrible detail. I think it's important that it not be censored. These are real people begging for help and receiving none. Their stories and images need to be seen. I just think a bit more warning could have been given at the start of the film. The other aspect of this doc that made it hard to watch was my complete frustration with the documentarian for staying so long in a war zone being bombed nearly constantly with her toddler daughter when she had an opportunity to leave her daughter with her parents in a safer place. She addresses this issue and makes an argument for her choices, but she didn't come remotely close to convincing me.

It´s definitely engaging form beginning to end (despite being long, many things happen). Most of the characters if not all are quite amoral probably in an attempt at reflecting what all of us humans can be. Good and bad. Way more exaggerated than what most people in real life are in my opinion, but that´s not a problem of the film of course. A lot of issues are approached regarding sex most of all, also other types of relationships and mental states. Every actor plays their part successfully and nothing will leave you indifferent.

The director don´t go on directions that one could expect, in this movie you would think that the movie is over at the 3/4 of it, but then you realized that are more minutes of the movie, and that´s when you´re lost and the movie is not gonna help you find it, you must find it.

579,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/elle/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Feb 13, 2017",9,"On December 20 I wrote a review of “Things To Come” a movie starring Isabelle Huppert.    In it I said,

“Isabelle Huppert is one of those rare actresses who can be doing one thing while her face shows, expresses, shows deeper  emotions. Huppert is an interesting actress to watch and I am looking forward to seeing her in “Elle”, a much praised with Oscar talk performance, which can only add to her stellar resume.”

I saw “Elle”, for which she was just nominated for an Oscar as Best Actress, deservedly so, and who I will be rooting for on Sunday February 26 on the Oscar telecast. Up to seeing this movie I was hoping Ruth Negga would win for “Loving”. In any case they are more deserving than Emma Stone, who I have nothing against though her performance comes nowhere these two.

Isabelle Huppert plays Michele Leblanc, a video game executive, who, during the first scene of the movie, is brutally attacked and **** by a masked man. While there are flashbacks to this particular act there are also repeat attacks and Michele’s reaction to them seems to change from fear to desire almost as if she was controlling the man and what was happening.

There are many suspects from Patrick (Laurent Lafitte), a married neighbor, to Robert (Christian Berkel), Michele’s lover and whose wife Anne (Anne Consigny) is Michele’s best friend and business partner. There are also some of the men who work for her from one who doesn’t like her and another who follows her around like a puppy. There is also her ex-husband Richard (Charles Berling) not quite as successful as she is.

Along with her various reactions to her attacker Michele also has a 22-23 year old son Vincent (Jonas Bloquet)  who has a girlfriend Josie (Alice Isaac) and thinks he is the father of their child which is, obviously, wrong plus Josie having attitude to both Vincent and Michele. There is Michelle’s mother Irene (Judith Magre) who is very full of herself and has a stroke while in the background is her father who committed a horrendous mass homicide when Michele was a young girl and was in the middle of the surrounding publicity.

While Michelle is pulled in many directions along with trying to find out who her rapist was/is and wanting to control him and the situation Isabelle Huppert commands us, letting us see what she wants us to see, keep us guessing what she may be thinking and feeling but you believe everything she shows you.

Partially a character study and partially a psychological thriller “Elle” is a film with excellent performances, top production values from the soundtrack to the photography with sharp direction and a good screenplay all held together by Isabelle Huppert who, after 100 movies and at the age of 64, shows what the best acting is like!

A definite must see!"
580,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/elle/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TVJerry,"Jan 16, 2017",7,"This movie starts with a ****. The woman who's attacked (Isabelle Huppert), goes into stealth mode, playing down the effects of this act of aggression. There are some notable parallels: she runs a company that creates violent video games and a relative is a serial killer. This film seems like it's headed to a revenge narrative (it is directed by Paul Verhoven, who's no stranger to sex and violence in his work), but expands into a compelling character study of a seemingly stable woman harboring a number of issues. Huppert is always fascinating to watch, even as the character seems to spiral in unexpected directions. It's not exemplary, but it is an unusual, complex and interesting experience."

She's really never been quite better. The rest of the film felt somewhat scattered and dragged out and the film's content and story became a bit too aberrant and even somewhat ridiculous in the second half for my tastes. Overall, despite the story just being average in my opinion, it's a fine film that's worth checking out for the most part due to a career-best performance from Huppert."

583,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/elle/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,BHBarry,"Dec 28, 2016",7,"“Elle” is a French film based on the novel “Oh…” written by Philippe Dijan (“Betty Blue”) with a screenplay by David Birke. Directed by Paul Verhoeven the movie stars Isabelle Huppert, Charles Berling and Laurent Lafitte in this tale of a woman who is **** and how she copes with the incident. The **** scenes are brutal in their violence and makes the viewing of the film an uneasy experience. What is more uneasy is the mind of the viewer as he or she recalls and tries to understand the theatrical presentation they have just seen for the story is complicated and made even more so by the subtitles. I am sure a French viewer would find the film easier to understand than his or her English-speaking counterpart. All that being said, this film is filled with suspense and mystery and, more than anything else, is a tribute and testament to the talents of Ms. Huppert. Her unbelievable ability to communicate and exude various degrees of emotions and sex appeal without ever uttering a word speaks volumes to her amazing acting ability.  I give a 7.5 with a warning for the squeamish viewer to beware."

Can **** ever be funny? No, but when you find out who the rapist is in this film – and who his wife is – maybe then you will begin to understand Huppert’s Michele Leblanc and see the many absurdities and ironies in this film. When you meet Michele’s parents and learn about her father, you may understand her **** life more clearly. And you may even find yourself laughing and admiring how Isabelle Huppert manages to make such a character come alive so that you understand and even sympathize with her."

I had no thought before the watch, but while watching it, I felt it was overrated. That's for a moment, once I finished watching it, realised it's a better film. I mean I changed my stance, after over and over thinking about the film. So its the patience you need, wait till the film to end to decide how much you liked it. It was too long, but every space was filled up with the best parts. It took time to understand the characters, and with multiple angle events in one woman's life. Isabelle Huppert was amazing. Despite so many characters in the film, she ruled it. One of her best films I have seen.

The film focused on the boss of a video game designing firm. It opens with as she's been sexually assaulted in her home by an intruder. Followed by one of her employees morphed her face to an animated character as a sexual explicit material for the game they are working in. So she begins her investigation to find both the culprit who might be the same person. This is where the suspense comes into play to develop interest in us. Besides, facing family troubles takes some extra development. Subsequently, all the mysteries will be solved and to know how it ends, you should watch it.

""Michele to her cat: You did not have to claw his eyes out, but scratch him at least.""

It is official French submission to the 89th American Academy Awards. But as per the latest news bulletin, this film is out of the Oscars race, despite made into the Golden Globes. From the director of the original 'Total Recall' and his first French film. Based on the book named 'Oh...'. But I felt it was developed from a small part of 'The Little Death'. Basically, there's an understanding being it is the story of the adults, despite the sexual violences and that's how this story was built. So you must compromise on a few things that is shown in it if you really want to enjoy it.

I did not like it all the sudden, though looking back all the film events and joining them together made me see the film was decent. Especially that final line said by a woman who was evacuating her house makes whole thing sense. Maybe that's the real twist in the tale. Initially I did not think to write a review, but surely it deserved one from me, so I wrote this short and quick. This is the film for the grown ups, but not for all the grown ups. So I hope it will meet your expectation if you decide to try, but according to me definitely it is worth.

Many of the film's shocking sequences are on par with those found in pictures like ""A Clockwork Orange"" and definitely not for the squeamish nor faint of heart, but its superb lead performance by Isabelle Huppert nevertheless keeps one's eyes glued to the screen, almost no matter what happens. Those easily offended by violence and explicit sexuality would be wise to skip this one, but viewers who appreciate a provocative psychological thriller with a singularly cynical, macabre wit may find this an irresistible guilty pleasure."

It's fair to say that the film is about 10 minutes too long and for those paying close attention the eventual unmasking of the guilty party comes as no big surprise.

And my mind was blown. This is the best gangster movie Bollywood has ever made, and that's saying something since Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai also exists.

When the film begins, it seems like it will be the same old, generic good guy vs bad guy movie. But as the story progresses, the line between the good and bad people blurs to the point where it doesn't exist anymore. In the beginning it feels like Sardar Khan is supposed to be the hero, but slowly he's shown to be a terrible person who gets in fights with everyone and marries a second time just because he's getting horny.

Nawazuddin Siddiqui's Faisal is introduced in the second part after the demise of Sardar Khan. The bad guys really make you feel like killing them, and the way they speak is very reminiscent of the villages from Bihar and east UP. The acting by literally everyone is phenomenal, such that it inspired memes for years to come, and that's being in a good way. Every scene has been choreographed so well it actually gives you the feeling of those poor, low class families from suburban areas.

It is certainly a special movie which I very much recommend. It has earned 6 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and I think it is deserving of the recognition and praise it has so far received. Writer-director Lee Isaac Chung based this story of a Korean family settling in rural Arkansas in the 1980’s to start a farm on his own similar childhood experiences. In dramatizing his own story, Chung has made a film that is personal and relatable even if you are not Korean, or a farmer, or an immigrant. If you’ve tried chasing any part of the American dream, you’ll recognize something in Minari.

Stephen Yuen and Yeri Han play Jacob and Monica, a Korean couple who have just moved from California to Arkansas with their two young children, Anne and David, to pursue Jacob’s dream of having a big farm—like the Garden of Eden—that will thrive and allow the family to do the same. Monica is skeptical to say the least, especially when she sees the trailer on the plain plot of land that is to be their new home. Adding to her anxiety is David’s heart murmur and how far away they are from a city and a hospital. The arrival of Monica’s mother, Soonja, complicates some things (like the sleeping arrangement in the small trailer) and livens up others.

Minari’s focus is on the relationship that shy 6-year-old David has with his outspoken grandmother, Soonja. This isn’t a cutesy movie about a little boy and his sassy grandma, though they certainly have that dynamic. David doesn’t like that she doesn’t act like a “real” grandma: she doesn’t bake cookies, she swears, watches wrestling, and drinks Mountain Dew. Yuh-jung Youn as Soonja steals every scene and is far and away the standout performer of the film. She has earned a well-deserved Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination and would be my choice to win if I were allowed to pick the winners. She isn’t just funny—which she is—or the character most out of place in this new home—which she is—but the emotions she stirs and her relationship with David are the heart of the movie. Alan Kim as David is just what you hope for in a child actor. He does not draw attention to himself and his behavior always comes across as natural, not contrived, even when he is playing a gross prank of his grandma. They share a wonderful, quiet scene together at a creek near the farm where she plants minari, a leafy vegetable; it is my favorite scene in the movie.

Steven Yeun, nominated for the Best Actor Oscar, and Yeri Han work very well together as a believable married couple. He is determined but not bullheaded and she is not unsupportive or a nag but is justifiably feeling isolated and concerned. It is clear that they care for each other and even though they are at a place where their future together is uncertain, we do not feel that they have a bad marriage. Will Patton, a familiar face even if you don’t recognize his name, has a small role with a notable performance as the kindhearted but very eccentric local who gladly helps Jacob on the farm. He speaks in tongues randomly and, in a scene late in the movie, performs an exorcism that is simultaneously comical and emotional.

The beautiful Oscar nominated score by Emile Mosseri would be my pick to win that category, again, if I were allowed to pick the winners. It is ethereal and enchanting and brimming with pathos. Chung has a tenderness in his direction and his screenplay—both are Oscar nominated—towards each of the characters and their points of view. My only real complaint is the plot contrivance that leads to the climax, but it is not a major strike against the movie because it drives the drama of the story forward and the final moments won me back easily. From start to finish Minari is filled with the kind of small, intimate and affecting moments that are so rarely done well on screen. Wonderful, wonderful Minari indeed."

620,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/minari/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Iceman21,"Mar 24, 2021",8,"This American-South Korean indie film reflects memories from director Lee Isaac Chung's childhood. After manageable living conditions in California, the South Korean family of four Yi moves to rural Arkansas, where the father wants to start a farm. This decision causes tension with his wife. The two children try to distract themselves from the arguments between their parents. However, they are bored most of the time until their hitherto unknown grandmother strides into their lives.

The great strength of Minari lies in its outstanding cast and their chemistry with each other. There is no clear protagonist, they all get their own storylines and experiences. Alan Kim, as the youngest son David, is already confronted with fundamental situations. He and his big sister Anne (Noel Kate Cho) have several moments where unconditional sibling love is communicated in a very simple way. This makes their bond enormously natural and real. The most profound relationship, however, is shared by David and his grandmother Soon-ja, played by the fantastic Yoon Yeo-jeong. Although they don't get up to operating temperature at first because David refuses to acknowledge Soon-ja's anti-granny ways (she doesn't cook or bake and uses swear words), the two grow closer as the film progresses. Every time they share the screen, hilarious and emotional dialogue is guaranteed. Exclusively the latter applies to Steven Yeun and Han Ye-ri, who play the two parents Jacob and Monica. Although their mutual love is always palpable, they are in a continuous conflict that reaches its climax at the end. Jacob wants to leave sorting chicks behind and prove himself to his family with his own farm. Monica, on the other hand, is tired of living in a trailer and doing Jacob's bidding and is eager to give her children an adequate home. Both embody a couple that seems stable on the surface but is crumbling badly underneath.

In addition to the fantastic actors, Chung Minari's direction adds the finishing touches. The script is funny, gets under the skin and gives someone the realistic picture of a family that wants to start a new and better life in the land of many opportunities. But the American dream is really only a secondary matter in Minari. Rather, Chung captures a natural and down-to-earth mood with stunning camerawork, a beautiful score and a lot of focus on the atmospheric mood. This makes the film a technical masterpiece that takes a lot of time in some scenes and therefore often seems almost still. This can sometimes seem tedious, but is completely in keeping with the overall feel of the film. While the first two acts of Minari focus on a lot of build-up and interpersonal interactions, things come to a head enormously in the last third. The film is told in a matter-of-fact way. Its inner and outer beauty makes Minari the feel-good experience of 2020!"
621,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/minari/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Stream2BigScree,"Mar 20, 2021",8,"Minari was nominated for 6 Academy Awards this week, including Best Picture; so, I had to see what all the hype was about. Minari has been in select theaters for about a month and is available for rent on demand, but I can't say that I had heard much about the film until recently. Written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung, who received nominations for both, Minari tells the story of a Korean-American family that relocates from California to a farm in Arkansas in the 1980s. The father, Jacob Yi (Steven Yeun), has a plan to grow Korean vegetables in order to set his family on a path to the American Dream; and the mother, Monica (Yeri Han), strives to improve her skills as a chicken sexer to support the family as she continues to be skeptical of Jacob's ambitions. The promotion for this film says that this is the movie we need right now. We shall see.

It is obvious that this is a personal story for Lee Isaac Chung. The family dynamics are depicted very tenderly, and although there are differences and arguments between the parents, neither is painted as a villain. Both Jacob and Monica want what's best for their family. We see much of the film through the eyes of the youngest Yi family member, David, who is played by Alan Kim in a remarkable performance for such a young child. There is a newness of the Arkansas landscape and the distant surrounding community that they all have to get acclimated to. While the plot of Minari is pretty basic just following whether Jacob will be successful in establishing his farm, once Monica's mother (Youn Yuh-jung) shows up a new energy and conflict is brought to the film.

All the parts of Minari come together to create a satisfying whole. Chung focuses of the members of the family such that each one has a personality and a stake in what's happening. The cast that was brought together do great work. I certainly understand why Yeun and Yuh-jung were nominated for their acting and why Alan Kim will be a kid popping up in order movies in the future. Moreover, the lush landscapes of rural Arkansas look very inviting and the score heighten the emotional heft of the movie. For me, Minari was surprisingly enjoyable for an otherwise straightforward family drama.

In conclusion, Minari is tender and emotional. More than ever, it does seem like it could be the movie we need right now. It reminds all of us about the typical American family that just wants its piece of the American Dream. Chung's personal touches makes Minari enjoyable and impactful. If you get a chance, get a big box of popcorn and watch this film."

I just hoped it didn't resort to melodrama at the end, as that sort of betrayed its naturalistic approach that kept the movie afloat, in the first place, from succumbing to its conventional plot.

The struggles and challenges they face in achieving the dream creates friction, but ultimately strengthens their bond as a family.

624,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/minari/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,1stReviews,"Mar 9, 2021",9,"Minari is one of the most inspirational family films I have watched in years. This exceptional cast pushes the limits of their family dynamic, as well as our hearts, as we see them struggle with everyday life problems. Jacob, played by Steven Yeun, moves from California to a Farmland in Arkansas with his family. The goal is to build a sustainable farm and live the American dream while dealing with many real-life issues that test the resilience of the household. He and his wife, Monica, played by Han Ye-ri, are recent immigrants from Korea in search of a better life for their kids. Jacob's dream of owning a farm brings the family to Arkansas with the purchase of a large farm and a house made out of an eighteen-wheeler. Monica is not fully happy with this plan for many reasons but goes along with the move to keep the family together. Director Lee Isaac Chung wrote and directed this semi-autobiographical film in 2018, ironically around a time he was considering retiring from directing. Though not a factual documentary, Chung included many memories into the film based on his childhood home in Arkansas. The fact that the film is based on many important moments in Chung's life is the driving force of the film. Early memories help to define who we are and Chung uses Jacob's son, David, as our guide through the film, allowing the audience to witness all these beautiful moments in his life unfold before their eyes. Moments of discovery, moments of understanding, and moments that teach him life lessons. Every member of David's family teaches him something important about life at some point in the film and these moments will define him for the rest of his life. Many of these important life lessons come from his relationship with his grandmother Soonja, who he spends all day with while his parents are at work. The two often travel down to the creek where they have started a small garden of their own with a plant from Korea called Minari, echoing the much larger garden of American vegetables that Jacob has grown.

Their kids Anne (Noel Cho) and David (Alan Kim) are at a very delicate age in their lives and Monica knows that their new environment will be a major change for them. One of her fears is the loss of their Korean culture because there are only a few Koreans in the new town they live in. Monica's mother moving in to help out with the kids is one of the ways they try and keep the Korean traditions thriving in the house. David also has some unexplained medical issues early on and living in the middle of nowhere poses an issue in the case that a hospital is needed for him. All of these issues are just some of the things that the family deals with which are easy to sympathize with.  The family is also struggling with their faith in the film. Having moved to a new town, working new jobs, and balancing new priorities, Monica worries that the kids are not going to practice their faith as often due to the town not having a Korean Church, but they choose to attend the towns Sunday mass in order to provide their children with an outlet to continue practicing their faith as well as interact with other local kids. Ironically, as everyone struggles with their issues, the one character that seems to be the happiest is also the most faithful in the film; Jacob's farm helper, Paul, is an extremely dedicated Christian who carries a cross around town each Sunday. To the Yi family, he comes off as a nut but he is often the voice of reason and offers his opinion in many situations, even though he is often discredited. As the head of the household, Jacob often has to deal with very difficult decisions that sometimes put the family at risk, and he often makes these decisions without even discussing them with Monica. Jacob's desire to succeed sometimes clouds his judgment and puts his family in harm's way but that he lives with his choices and continues to fight tomorrow. Regardless of how big or small; any choice you make in life has a repercussion and many of the choices made by the characters, seem to come full circle in the film. They often present themselves as new problems or make situations worse, however, it is the family's determination to learn and grow through these decisions that is most important. I really connected with this film and the Yi family, so much so that each member taught me something about myself in one way or another. Minari is now available on all Video on Demand platforms."

‘Minari’ is one of those ""slice of life"" movies set in 1980’s Arkansas, where a Korean family try to start a farm and make ends meet. This is the type of movie that even though the story is about a Korean immigrant family, you can still draw a deep emotional connection to it.

While the subject matter can have its dramatic elements, but it’s not to say the movie doesn’t have a sense of humor. It’s funny and incredibly endearing to watch. The movie does a great job of making you care about this family and you wish everything would work out for them. All thanks to the amazing script that helps flesh out the characters and made them all complex.

The performances from Steven Yeun, Han Ye-ri, and Youn Yuh-jung were all fantastic. Even from the child actors, Alan S. Kim and Noel Cho, gave great performances, especially during the more dramatic parts of the movie. Just goes to show there are great child actors out there.

The score, composed by Emile Mosseri, was superb and mixed Western and eastern styles to create a uniquely rich score. The movie itself looks so warm and sunny. The bright sun made all the mixture of different colors like green and blue look so luminous, it felt peaceful.

I can tell a story like this came from a personal place from director Lee Isaac Chung. You see, he came from a Korean family and he spend his childhood in Arkansas. The story was told from the heart and it was beautiful to watch.

Overall rating: A touching and heartfelt movie that deserves all the praise it’s getting. If you get the chance, check this one out."

I had just learned this film existed a few weeks ago but since this film was getting such high praise I went into this with pretty high expectations. This is such a gentle yet emotionally straining film, it’s truly a special experience to watch. The plot is great it’s an entertaining and deeply engaging story. It starts off as a story that has been told before but becomes much much more. The pacing is great from the first scene until the credits role it’s well paced. The acting is great Steven Yeun and Yeri Han give great performances. Yuh-Jung Youn gives a fantastic supporting performance, she is easily one of the best parts of this film. Alan S. Kim and Noel Cho give great child performances as well.

The direction is fantastic from Lee Isaac Chung, his direction is incredibly impressive and you can tell he was very passionate about making this. The script is great it’s a memorable and very well written script. The cinematography is fantastic, this film is full of shots that are so beautiful it’ll make your jaw drop. There is a certain shot where Jacob and Monica are watching the kids playing in the hospital waiting room and the camera focuses back and forth on the two faces. That one shot perfectly captures the story of the characters in less than a minute. The editing is great and the score is great as well.

The comedy is very subtle but when there is comedy it’s wholesomely funny. In terms of the Oscars there’s a strong possibility that this will sadly be overlooked/snubbed. If this did get it’s deserved attention from the academy I feel this would probably get nominated for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Supporting Actress: Yuh-Jung Youn. The ending scenes of the film are very emotional and the last shot is just brilliant. Overall Minari is wonderfully wholesome and emotionally engaging film that is truly a special movie. 94% A"

644,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-farewell/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,wayne_posh,"Jan 16, 2023",8,"In a nutshell, The Farewell can be described as a beautifully shot, well-acted family drama. It’s certainly all of those things, but it manages to take on so much more in its 100 minute runtime. Lulu Wang offers a unique insight into a family struggling to uphold tradition and even when it directly contradicts their own values. In this struggle, we see the long dormant dynamics of a New York based Chinese-American family get rattled into action as they travel to China to reconnect with the family matriarch in a time of need.

The cast immediately allows these family dynamics to be made tangible. Awkafina as Billi exudes a modern millennial apathy while at the same time balancing it with a sincere sense of sadness and vulnerability that brings the film’s protagonist to the forefront in a realistic, relatable way. The rest of the cast is rounded out by mostly unknowns (with the exception of the as always excellent Tzi Ma as Billi’s father) but they all bring to the screen a verisimilitude to this family that never allows the audience to question their love for one another. Brothers reunited after decades spent on separate continents engage in conversations of family duty and patriotism. A worried mother both admonishes her unambiguous daughter and defends her from other scrutinizing critics in the form of Aunties. And the ailing, frail Nai Nai brings family members from all parts of the globe to a single dining table to share a family dinner making up for lost time. Every scene is so well performed that the actors never appear to be reading lines or memorizing their blocking. The ways in which the family squabbles, cries, embraces, and forgives unfolds in such a real way that you are rooting for everyone even when their goals are in conflict. Beyond the performances, Lulu Wang’s direction brings China to life in a way few other films have achieved. While most Hollywood-backed films set in China tend to exoticize the location, The Farewell treats the setting with both a reverent and casual hand. The film depicts the changing infrastructure of China by highlighting the high rise buildings and modern architecture that replaced quaint, ancient communities. City streets lined with neon show China as a modern country that has all of the qualities a modern audience needs to anchor themselves into the narrative. But, thankfully, this modernity is juxtaposed with a view of China a western audience may never get to see. The dynamics of the kitchen and dining room implying the importance of a family meal shared where a family can both come together and hash out differences. A particularly moving and funny scene involving a visit to a gravesite allows a brief view into the importance of family within this culture that extends even into their passed ancestry. Without ever explicating, The Farewell offers to the cannon of cinema a compelling look into an unfamiliar landscape while making it accessible to even the most untraveled viewer.

The Farewell stitches many threads into its final woven masterpiece. The compelling and ultimately satisfying story leads the viewers to observe sadness, glee, and fear while giving them reasons to acknowledge those emotions within themselves. Actors who have an important, admirable job of bringing to life traditional customs unknown to their audience. And ultimately, a better understanding of ourselves and choices made in our own relationships. The Farewell will provide you with answers to questions about life you didn’t even know you had while beckoning you to rewatch before much time has passed."

Writer/director Lulu Wang’s first feature is about as good as it gets for a debut, especially one based on emotional situations involving her family. She captures the divide I suspect many immigrants must experience when settling in a new country and identifying with a new culture. In some ways, it might have been good for her to play herself in the lead. But then, with being a first attempt at feature movie making and a project as personally involving as this, I agree, that would have been a hefty call.

Her cast is marvelous, with each delivering perfect characterizations to the somewhat demanding situations they bring to life. It’s billed as a comedy (I figure mainly for the sales angle) and while there’s a good degree of ironic humor, I seemed to spend more time with watery eyes. Her director of photography, Spanish-born Anna Franquesa Solano delivers highly professional steady images, for what appears to be only her second feature and it's a welcome relief from the clumsy wobble cam so often found in Indi shows. Perhaps it’s a little longish at 1h40m and might have done with less of the slow-mo (although some of this is emotionally strong)  Composer Alex Weston provides a thoughtful score and the careful selection of additional accompanying songs is superb, all helping to create a warm feel to proceedings.

It’s to be hoped we see more quality features from this talented young woman, and that she may resist the temptation to throw it away on lowly commercial features – she certainly has proven that independent stories can out-gross even the big budget productions. The DVD features extras and is nicely transferred, although the white subtitles would have benefitted from an added black drop-shadow (and yes, one of the deleted scenes should not have even been considered for the final script, a good decision by whoever made it) Above Average.

The Farewell is written and directed by Lulu Wang, and starring Shuzhen Zhao, Awkwafina and X Mayo.

The film follows a Chinese family who, when they discover their beloved Grandmother has only a short while left to live, decide to keep her in the dark and schedule an impromptu wedding to gather before she passes. Billi, feeling like a fish out of water in her home country, struggles with the family's decision to hide the truth from her grandmother.

I wasn't so excited to see The Farewell, I haven't even seen the trailer, but I saw Blu-Ray preview and I thought that this might actually be a good movie, and it was! The Farewell is such a great, beautiful and sweet movie, and what makes this movie really works that it doesn't focus on the farewell only, but it discuses some other cultural themes, and that what makes this movie really works, that it has so many other things to do besides it's main storyline.

The Farewell is beautifully shot, Wang did a great job with this movie, MOST of the movie was shot flawlessly! Each scene was combined with amazing soundtrack, and that made this movie so saddening sometimes, and I guess that was the message from this movie, to discuss a true tradition that Chinese people used/or use to do, and it gets to your heart so quickly, because you kinda feel for them, and Wang directed this movie in a way that will make feel for them so quickly.

You'll find yourself crying at least once during this movie, no matter how tough you're, it's hard not to cry throughout this movie, part of it because of the amazing OST and Wang's amazing long scenes and build up, but most of it because of the acting; everyone in this movie did an amazing job, there're no exception, because everyone did his role perfectly, and they showed emotions like if it was a real life documentary, their acting didn't feel like acting, it was so real and that's why it was so heart-touching!

This movie is not only sad, it was funny from time to time, and that gave the movie an even more realistic theme, because life isn't always sad, even in their situation they found a way to add some laughs, and that worked very well, because a movie like this needs a little bit of a positive energy to move forward, Wand understood that perfectly, and she made a great combination between real-life cultural themes, with some slight humor.

This movie isn't just about the Chinese culture, it's not just relatable to the Chinese people only, though it does that for the most part of this movie, but it also did a great job comparing the Chinese culture to our American culture, it was only shown in a couple of scenes only, but I'm so glad that they did that! Also the movie has some relatable themes, either you are Chinese, or American.. or whatever your nationality is, the movie has something else than those themes too, and I won't spoil it for you, because it wasn't shown in any of the trailers, but what I would say about it is ""Home is where the heart is"", people who watched this movie will get what I mean, and the movie discusses THAT in a great way, deep and emotional!

The movie's not flawless by any means, don't get me wrong, it's not a perfect movie or anything, we'll get to that in a minute, but a movie like that isn't easy to hate, that's what I would say,  so before I get into flaws, if you haven't seen The Farewell go check it out, it definitely worth a look.

When it comes to flaws I think this movie has some dull scenes, for instance there's a scene where Billi and her uncle were walking down the street and he was telling what she should do and what she shouldn't do, and went telling her the same things over and over again, I don't know if it was meant to be funny or not, but it was kinda long.

There's also a scene where the main family was playing games at a wedding, it was also long, and unnecessary... Some other scenes were like this, long and unnecessary scenes, though the movie is 98 minutes only, there're some scenes that could have been cut from the movie, and they're not few for a 98 minutes movie!

The build-up of this movie was well-crafted, the first and the third act were amazingly crafted, but the second act kinda drag a little, it took a few turns that only made the movie longer, and some scenes dull, not the whole act though, but some of it made some unexpected choices.

The Farewell is an amazing movie, well-acted, well-crafted and beautifully shot, it's one of the most memorable movies of 2019, though it's kinda not so rewatchable.

I'm gonna give The Farewell a B+!

Go see movies like this, it's really good to see people making these movie in 2019, instead of all those CGI-filled movies, this movie definitely deserves a look."

I admit that I think it received more appreciation than it deserved and it's not that for any reason I'm saying this is a bad film is just that The Farewell is just a simple drama and completely within the norm.

More than one may feel identified with the family dynamics the film portrays although I honestly had some complication with the main point of the narrative because although it has its cultural explanation it seems offensive to hide such news from the person receiving that news. To hide something like that from someone is to deny their own humanity and dignity.

It certainly has its touching and endearing moments although as I said nothing out of the ordinary however I grant it the extra half star because it will certainly make you have a good talk after seeing it and when a film achieves that, it gains my recognition.

And hey, Awkwafina can act."

The Farewell

The writer and director Lulu Wang is on mark. To say that she is onto something would be understating things. And I do mean just this film and not her work throughout her career. For the film is armed with an extremely powerful script. And if looking at her procedure, her execution of this film, it certainly follows textbook rules efficiently. There might not be any boundaries broken or creativity flared across the screen, but just authenticity is displayed. And if thought about it, her own script doesn't leave anything for her to stretch and celebrate.

The script is beautifully, sharply and almost necessarily edited. Each sequence makes sense, one after the another adds up and lines up fittingly. It flows like it should. If you take out one string of this film, the entire film falls apart. The theme is specifically specific in terms of the situational objections it creates yet, with an incredible set of characters and cast, the branches are important in this tree and they set out arguably one of the finest generic and timely film. It also is said to be funny.

But it isn't funny in the sense that it makes you chuckle. It makes those characters happy and not us. We as an audience are told to be focused on entirely something else. Those sub texted narrative points is where The Farewell makes this emotionally simple and sweet departure so heavy. The Farewell also has this one fine quality that I miss these days. And that is that there is no way you can predict where this is all going. Leading towards. We are sort of like the Nai Nai character in the film. But then it doesn't matter if the elders (the younger in the story and the makers outside the story) says to just tuck it in."

She plays the lead role fantastically and is supported by quality performances from the rest of the cast. While this film's tone is for the most part serious, it does have good comedic beats that are truly funny rather than just your average slapstick comedy. Overall, Lulu Wang is able to carefully walk the fine line between making the movie flat out depressing and making the audience unable to take it seriously through her clever blend of drama and comedy. The plot of this film ultimately takes a unique approach into investigating cultural differences and how said differences affect our familial relationships. This film at the end of the day is about those familial relationships and how they can be strained during times of sadness. You don't have to be Asian or Asian American to find this film relatable or enjoyable. My criticisms of this film are brief and mainly amount to: this film didn't do a whole lot that I haven't seen before. This film is very well crafted from start to finish. The direction, writing, cinematography, and acting are all superb, but at the end of the day I feel that a lot of the messages that this film tries to get across can be found in very similar ways in other films. This film is a must see, but in my opinion is not as revolutionary as some might say."

The Farewell is a touching story of death and family. It reminds me a lot of The Royal Tenenbaums in the sense that this movie takes immaculate cinematography, the highest comedy, the lowest tragedy, and a family dynamic, all while juggling and juxtaposing its deep themes throughout a litany of great performances. The cast is awesome, and there really is not a weak performance in the ensemble. Everything is so realistic and honest, and it just blew me away with how raw it was.

Where The Farewell falters is in its third act. The editing somehow gets worse in act three, and where every shot leading up to the finale is perfect, there are some really bad edits that really made me wonder if they ran out of film by the end! Speaking of endings, I didn't feel that The Farewell knew how to end. Maybe that was intentional? It was just jarring to have three separate scenes where everything is wrapped up so nicely, only for the movie to continue and remind you how nicely everything was wrapped up. And The Farewell kept doing this. This movie is based on a true story, and I feel this method of ending the movie really held it back.

All in all, this is a really strong, fantastic movie that I have no doubt in my mind I will watch and enjoy again and again. If you get the opportunity to see The Farewell, I can't recommend it enough. I can't wait to see what other people think of it!"

In US, the doctor bear legal responsibility to deliver the death verdict to you. In China, the news is usually delivered to their family member and it is up to the family to decide how or if they expose the news to their loved ones. This decision is usually only apply to the seniors in the family. It is a ""crime"" committed by the whole gang. To people live in China, it is not questionable. It is the way it is, it is responsibility of the offspring to bear the burden. This is premise of the movie. A practice is questioned by their uprooted American grown granddaughter, Bellie. The movie is not exactly all about this premise, dilemma, paradox. It is about how to love. In Chinese family, love is not being said, but done. As the grandma, Nainai, says, how to do it matters. Bellie want to say her last goodbye to Nainai; but to Chinese, we don't say goodbye. To say it out is shallow, but keep it deep in the heart. On the top of mourning, the movie also shows the dynamics between family members: Nainai and mom has under tension going; mom and dad are on rocky term; mom and Bellie has tense feeling on Grandpa's death; Mom and aunt argued about China and US... These conflicts are all yielding to their over hang grief. Death is the final God. And this is how Chinese family, community and country work together to keep harmony. The movie is a masterpiece worth watch over and over. The plot, if you referring to the premise is very simple and straight forward, but it layered many aspect in such a small space and time frame.    And there is Ellen, singing her heart out for Little Nainai, Nainai's sister and the family. What else you can ask for a movie like this?"

She plays an Asian-American who returns to China with her family for one last visit with her grandmother, who's been diagnosed with advanced cancer. The catch: because they believe that the news will do more harm than the disease, they can't tell grandma. This leads Awkwafina to brood for the whole movie, almost never taking advantage of her comic abilities to add contrast that would make the heavy moments more poignant. Even so, this examination of family connections and cultural expectations is crafted as a sweet personal drama."

It is what use to be called  a 'small' film but in reality it covers a lot of subjects all families deal with which brings laughs and tears and major differences no matter how small or big a family is.

I have seen Awkwafina in both """"Crazy Rich Asians"" and ""Ocean's 8"" and I vaguely remember her 'wacky' roles but here she becomes a major player in movies and should get an Oscar nomination if not more. In the pivotal role as Billi, a daughter and granddaughter, she is rarely off screen whether in the New York or Changchun, China. Starring opposite her and, at times, stealing the picture from everyone, is Zhoa Shuzhen as the grandmother Nai Nai who has kept a close relationship with her granddaughter.

The film opens with ""based on an actual lie"" and it is a whopper of one as Nai Nai has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer without too much time left and the whole family conspires to keep the news from her and, yet, as in all families little lies are brought to light as we get to know the characters.

In more than one way ""The Farewell"" is a family movie, for any family of any nationality and background. This is a film the whole family can see together and in many cases will see themselves in how they relate to the various relatives from parents to siblings to cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc.

The film is based upon the true story of the director's, Lulu Wang, family and she does a great job of drawing you into the story without any melodrama, keeping  the lie real and except for two scenes keeping it all low keyed making it more moving not to forget bringing in a lot of humor.

Has not knowing of her diagnosis did Nai Nai live longer and if she had known would she have died sooner? Be sure to see the ending credits which, in a way, answers that question but, in any case,  be sure to see ""The Farewell""!"

The lead actress, Akwafina, plays the U.S based granddaughter who travels to China to join the rest of her family there. It is this interplay with all her relatives that affords the writer/director the opportunity to create and blend comedy and drama all in the same vehicle. The film captures the essence of what true family is all about regardless of the culture, race or location of the events that may befall them.

A atuação de Nina Hoss é o maior marco do filme. Ela casa muito bem com a atmosfera e diz muito apenas com suas expressões faciais, que são quase hipnotizantes. É impossível não simpatizar com ela, visto o que ela passou e o que a aguardava. Cada sorriso ou olhar sucinto foi muito bem estudado e isso é magnifico. Os personagens foram muito bem desenvolvidos. Nina Kunzendorf entrega uma melancolia profunda, que com alguns sinais, já eram o suficiente para imaginar o que havia de vir. Ronald Zehrfeld é consistente e passa mesmo uma imagem de que está desesperado para sair daquela vida, mas de forma sucinta.

O roteiro, junto a direção, trabalha muito bem com o psicológico da Nelly, e de acordo com o que vamos descobrindo junto a ela, ficamos cada vez mais aflitos quanto ao momento que ela se revelará. E que final, meus amigos...

Phoenix is a film that rips your heart out as you watch this woman realize what has happened in the aftermath of her being sent to a concentration camp.

The film is about two characters who bump into each other and slowly start opening up about things, about their family, culture, death, career hopes and other such things. It is somewhat thoughtful and while its a reasonably slow film, plot wise, it has a nice laid back sense to it which I enjoyed, even though it is somewhat serious at points.  Yes I'd recommend this film...perhaps its a little indulgent and certainly it won't appeal to people wanting constant action or 'full blown entertainment' as such but its a good film never the less - it certainly has an aesthetic appeal to it, which is a little hard to fully put my finger on.

It’s when considering this that it’s hard to ignore just how deep he looks into the abyss and explores philosophical ideas. Anomalisa is yet another example of this. In truth, his films make a lot more sense if you have prior knowledge on the psychological explorations that he’s intent on. In this case, Kaufman takes a condition known as the “Fregoli delusion” (notice the name of the hotel in the film), a genuine condition in which an individual believes those around them are all the same person and are actually only in disguise. Needless to say, the paranoia and uncertainty with such a condition would be immense but that’s exactly what drives this the masterfully accomplished work. It challenges perspective and the decision to make it stop-motion animation is an absolute masterstroke. Not only is it precisely detailed but it manages to combine both realism and surrealism in its artistry which is a wonderful tool in exploring the unravelling of our protagonist’s psyche. Patience is certainly required throughout the film as it takes things very leisurely and requires a mature audience to capture its themes and intentions. However, if you surrender to Kaufman’s intricate majesty, it’s a thoroughly rewarding work and a shining example of the overlooked medium of stop-motion animation where Kaufman’s co-director, Duke Johnson, also deserves high praise."
721,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/anomalisa/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LegitSalt,"May 6, 2020",9,"Charlie Kaufman is my favourite writer for film and television. In many ways, Anomalisa follows thematically with other entries in Kaufman’s oeuvre, but it also explores new ground. Kaufman himself is a man who struggles deeply with his mental health, something that is reflected in his work. Anomalisa is Kaufman’s second directorial piece and comes during a time when his work was not deemed commercially viable, as such the film was crowdfunded. Despite being made on a shoestring budget, the budgetary constraints allow for Kaufman to push himself. In other words, the unintentional constraints allow Kaufman to do more with less. Anomalisa is a Claymation surrealist film that explores many elements of human connections. The limited cast and simple animation give the film an air of authenticity. Both highlight the creative choices made and allow for the thematic elements to become more defined. The writing is one of the most commendable elements of the film. It is filled with wit and subtlety, something that is present in all of Kaufman’s writing. Anomalisa offers a strange, yet uniquely pleasing experience, it is rough around the edges but is just as easily loved."

The presentation looks impressive. The stop motion animation is really smooth and fantastic, the sets are unbelievable and look so realistic that at times I forget I’m watching a set of a stop motion film and the lighting and the cinematography are amazing. The characters also look unique and they have a stylistic choice that is done not because “it looks cool and different” but also because it fits with the messages this movie has. Everything feels so human, so realistic, from the world to the actions of the characters, it’s impressive. There’s so much to talk about. It is a movie that will end up blowing your mind for sure. It talks in a cynical way about how life and human relations can get monotone and boring. It portrays loneliness and how it doesn’t matter if you have everything, you can still feel miserable. Again, it has so much too say in just a runtime of barely 90 minutes. My only issue is the pacing I guess. Because the start is a bit slow and then it becomes a lot more fast-paced and remains like that for the rest of the movie. It is also a breath of fresh air to see a stop motion animation clearly made for adults. While Isle of Dogs is not really a kids movie it isn’t rated R, meanwhile Anomalisa is, and takes advantage of that to bring a truly mature story."

Anomalisa

Anomalisa is a character driven animated feature whose exaggeration of a metaphor is so poetic that it leaves the audience in an awe of it throughout the course of the feature. The writing is rare and exquisite where its ""baby steps"" procedure is not only a pro of it but a calculative risk. The conversations aren't pragmatic but it is so beautifully sketchy that it falls in piece by piece into the puzzle and unlocks something beyond cinematic. In fact, there is a conversation between Leigh and Thewlis that is weaved in with an eye on such a closure, that the audience is staring at an abyss in the end of it.

It is also brimmed with humor, that draws a chuckle every now and then and is imputed with no additional force. The narrative flows like water and melts like butter that is soothing to the long last appetite of the audience. Kaufman isn't ready to compromise its craft at any level, the boldness is as much as scary as it is glorifying. It's world of smoke and mirrors are not mere hoax to hold the audience and project the unexpected but is pure ethos; it may not rhyme or it ought not to rhyme, to tap with the beats. It is rich on technical aspects like cinematography and editing but is somewhat short on background score. The art designing is pure finesse and plausible especially to pull it off on such scale. The voice cast Thewlis and Leigh (she sings beautifully) has done an amazing job with Noonan literally supporting through thick and thin. The humane emotion, the chemistry, the conversations, the randomness and the specificity, all of it are the high points of the feature, every last detail. The director duo, Kaufman and Johnson has created a masterpiece that is at best simply emotional and at worst technically complex. Anomalisa is more personal than a cinema ever will be, and it's a calm ride to hop in."

731,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/anomalisa/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"Jun 14, 2016",7,"Through the eyes of one who thinks everyone in the world is alike.

The film was based on the stage play. Originally it was meant for a short movie, but during in the production it was extended to a feature film length and ended up knocking the Oscars door. A R-rated stop-motion animation, which is the first in the history of the Academy Awards to get a nomination. My last stop-motion was the last year's 'Shaun the Sheep Movie', so that makes this kind of filmmaking is going extinct. For that reason alone, I just don't want to miss it out, as well as I prepared to enjoy every bit of it and so I suggest others to do the same if they find it interesting.

My expectation was quite simple which is entertainment. But usually animations are comedies, in that perspective, this is slightly a letdown. Wait, this film is for adults and of course the humours in this narration was delivered on its own style like a black comedy. It is a weird title right! But the film explains it in a simple manner. That's not it, there are more weird stuffs in it, like I was confused over the character voice tones for both the sexes and again the film had the reasons which will be revealed at a crucial segment.

It was something like 'Lost in Translation', about a middle-aged man named Michael Stone, who is on a trip to Cincinnati to promote his latest book. Slowly it unfolds what kind of person he's really and going further, his struggle in the married life comes the prime focus. So this tour opens a new door for him once again to fall in love which leads him for a tough decision to make. But at a certain extent, the reality check comes into play. About everything he's doing and all the life he left behind makes him feel he's trapped in some kind of delusion. His ultimate decision is where this tale going to conclude.

""Sometimes there's no lesson.
That's a lesson in itself.""

The camera never takes off its lens in its throughout narration on the main character, Stone. Right from the beginning till the final scene, the film follows him like in a real time. So the entire film was like everything that happened in a 24 hour. That's the character development you would get. Besides, there are scenes, like the sex part that may stun you. Because it was not like I have ever seen one, not in animation. Even compared it to the Hentai, Hentai was 2 dimensional pictures whereas this is technically a 3 dimensional, so the effect was much more realistic and the impact on the viewers definitely will be strong.

The real problem those who saw it to end up in a disappointment is that it's not your regular animation. Which is usually aimed for children and family audience, but adults too can have a great time, whereas this film had a very matured and sensitive contents. Maybe they did not want the display of the real life experience to be narrated with a bunch of toys. But in the perspective of stop-motion animation, it is a great artistic achievement. It is not only their anticipation that killed their joy, but failing to accept the fact that we see regularly in the live-shot films to see them again in a different format.

What I liked the most in it was the message regarding the main character on his suffering. When he sits in front of the antique he bought for his son which makes him realise himself on what he's seeking in others around him. But what's his delusion is that he thinks the world is not balanced, everyone are alike. So what he actually needs is a redefined life, in which this film portrayed how close he came to one before everything ****.

This is not just a comedy, but a very real film for the people who wants to understand the life on its different stages and threat it poses where every one of us go through in our lifetime. Surely it is no masterpiece, but there's no reason to ignore on the subject it deals. It will remain one of the best stop-motion animation, exclusively made for adults. There are grown up who simply ignore animations, because they think it is too cartoonish. Undoubtedly it will be a good film them to try.

It was not a masterpiece, it was not the best animated film but is possibly the best movie of Kaufman. The only problem is I did not understand because Michael Stone in a scene drops the part that holds the mouth of the doll. That's not realistic, that's pretty rare. The rest not much to tell. I liked the characters, the drama I liked, I loved the character design and I laughed too withthe voice of other characters. Micheal Stone is someone who really looks like human unlike others. After all, Anomalisa is not the best animated film (in my opinion Shaun the Sheep Movie is), but a good adult film and shows that animation can not only be just for kids (there are insults and long sex scene ). I would say that is the best I received this year and I think adults can enjoy. It's just not felt like a masterpiece as the critics say."

HELL NO
The movie is great, great ideas, nice voice acting, great characters design and characters development. But the animation, with no doubt, is one of the best animation in animation history. It doesnt feels artificial or they have cartoony faces, they look human, act human and they are shown as humans.
A delightful movie, but for teens interested in animation or just for adults, not kids"

Eternal Sunshine is one of my favourite films of all time and Anomalisa closely follows suit. The film mainly takes place in and around the hotel in which Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) visits to deliver a press conference.
However, more and more is explained to us as the film carries on and we find out that Michael Stone has some sort of issue; or is it the people around him? The film deals with personality, narcissism, misogyny and delusion in a way that you can slowly decode but in an encrypted enough fashion for you to want to watch this film again. There is an intense amount of things going on under the surface of this film.
The film is also a very emotionally anchored film, that really makes you believe in the characters in a human way. The film is also beautifully shot and includes each part of creepy, comedic, and touching tones to the film that are all captured perfectly.
The film may end in a way that leaves you slightly unsatisfied but it does to some extent complete Michael Stone’s story arc. This film is complex and delicate, and is an astonishing achievement to see.
There is so much I can speak about with this film but I don’t want to give too much away so all I can say is go watch this film and then discuss it with others online.

I would never watch this film again, becasue it is very Depressing and feels incredibly incomplete by the end *smart move, just like love* but give it a shot if your in for a semi-philosophical joy ride."
738,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/anomalisa/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,bttrmovies,"Feb 2, 2016",9,"In a lot of ways, I think insecurity and self doubt is an essential part of being human. Now that isn't to say that it should control us or be a key component of our day to day life. I mean it in a way that we all suffer from it, but it is how we approach it that helps determine how we can function and how we succeed in life and handle failures. Because of this, Anomalisa and Charlie Kaufman in general succeed on multiple fronts and stick in your mind long after the credits roll on the screen. And by addressing the ideas of self doubt and insecurity, Anomalisa is a depressing yet ultimately fulfilling trip that may reveal more to the viewer than what it seems.

This film follows a successful writer and human services expert, Michael Stone, on a two day business trip to Cincinnati. Michael seems unsatisfied with his trip, his life, and his family. He keeps a breakup letter from a former lover in his pocket and reads it as a way to relive a moment when he felt something. What he felt seems to be unknown, even to himself. In this world the viewer is presented, everyone has the exact same voice. Which is why, about 30 minutes into this short film (only 85 minutes long, not including the end credits) when we hear a voice that is definitively different from Michael and the rest of the world, Michael, and in turn the viewer, takes notice. He hunts down this voice to find the kind and unassuming Lisa (voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh, who does wonderfully in the role as someone who is - like Michael - insecure, but a lot more open about it).

In Lisa, Michael sees someone different. A way to escape, a new world being presented to him. And he doesn't want her to leave his side. At this point, I'll leave the plot for those who wish to see the movie and go into the actual review portion of this write up. Anomalisa plays with the insecurities that we feel, pitting them in the eyes of Michael. Michael isn't the greatest character. In fact, we know very little about him given that we are only viewing him for 2 days in his life. That said, we may not know all of his personality and history but we do see his soul. He is a lonely man who just wants to feel something - whether it be a connection to his family, his ex lover, or Lisa. We feel for him and can see so much of ourselves in this middle aged man. And when he meets Lisa and begins to show interest in her, we feel his excitement.

This movie also features a very tastefully and intimate love scene. I haven't mentioned it yet, but I will point out that this movie is completely stop motion animated. This means that this love scene could oh so easily come off as comedic and in poor taste, especially since animation is most often associated with children's movies, or even adult comedies - of which this is neither. But the love scene is so well done that it doesn't feel off or funny, although there will inevitably be a few moments before and at the beginning of the scene where the viewer wonders how far this scene will go and feel slightly thrown aloof. But I assure you, it is well handled.

Through his experiences with Lisa, we don't get a happy ending for Michael (spoiler alert I suppose, but if you've seen a Charlie Kaufman film you should be prepared for this turn). But we do get a glimpse at a man who may be finding a path towards his reversal of fortune. A nervous breakdown towards the end of the film offers some sort of release for Michael and we get the feeling that while his moments in Cincinnati didn't ""fix"" him, they may have given him some sort of reprieve from the life he seems so afraid and fed up with.

Overall, this is a well acted and made film. I cannot imagine the man hours that went into the animation of the film, but it was worth it. Furthermore, I believe this movie is the one that should win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, not Inside Out. I doubt that it will happen because not many will see this movie and Disney/Pixar have a pretty tight hold on the Animated Feature Oscar. However, it is very deserving of both the award and the praise, as this should hopefully spark more filmmaker interest in making something like an adult drama in the form of an animated film. That said, it is also Charlie Kaufman which makes me think no one else would be crazy enough to try this on a grand stage like he is, and that the rest of us as viewers are both better and worse off for it..."

On the plus side, David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh as the two lead voice talents felt perfectly cast and fit the model of their characters rather well. Overall, the whole stop-motion idea was an interesting choice and the film's story also had some fun little quirks and ideas to show, but I still can't help but feel like it came up rather short of my expectations, as well as its potential."

Everything about the film is twisted around a relatively normal idea or emotion but either the films use of animation or the disassociation felt by Noonan voicing every single side character. The script, written  by far out storyteller Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation) looks at a married businessmans feelings of not belonging to the world he lives in as he travels to a conference only to be presented with Lisa (Jason Leigh), a woman unlike anyone he knows. The film tackles feelings of not belonging, of not being able to notice the unique elements of life. The film tackles the psychological nature of married life, the idea that complacency can lead to inadequacy and can make you feel like your life is just more of the same. The fact that Noonan is everywhere you turn in the film only propagates this idea. Ultimately its hard to find the joy in life every day but once you fail to find it, it becomes easier to miss it more and more until unhappiness blurs the way you perceive life and in Anomalisa you get a glimpse of that kind of thinking and it's a little disconcerting but no less captivating."

Anomalisa is about a depressed customer service rep faces the mundanity of his life and one day finds someone he can finally connect with.

What a better way to end the year is to talk about ""Anomalisa"", one of my most anticipated movie of 2015. Charlie Kaufman is an inspiration, as a writer and now a director. Synecdoche, New York is one of my all time favorite movies, and yeah it's for everyone, but I personally loved it as with every repeat viewings of the movie made my love each more. Now we've got Anomalisa, Kaufman's new film and I did have the pleasure of watching the movie last night, I thought it was freaking fantastic. He did it again everyone.

What really surprised me is how Anomalisa is the least complicated film by Charlie Kaufman, I mean Synecdoche, New York was very complicated and really needed Analyzing with repeat viewings just to get a gasp on what's happening, but here it's not that complicated. But the movie has a lot of clever and excellent choices that makes this movie just as unique as it is, I mean since we live in a age that every movie is the same, this movie stands out from the rest and it's execution was better than most of the animated movies I've seen this year.

Duke Johnson and Charlie Kaufman are the main directors of this movie, and both of them have created one marvel of a film. Both of them mixed humor and seriousness together perfectly well. Duke Johnson is best known for working on TV shows such as: Moral Orel, Mary Shelley's Frankenhole, and Community. So yeah, ""Anomalisa"" is Duke Johnson's first feature length film and I thought he did a brilliant job on this movie, as he worked well with Charlie.

Another thing I have to praise is the animation as it is freaking flawless. The movie is in stop motion and it's seriously impressive. When are main character goes through doors into different rooms and hall ways it was handled marvelously, because it makes this universe that the movie is set in feel real. The voice acting and the character designs made these characters feel like real people. Oh and how can I not talk about the characters eyes in this movie, as it was more realistic and impressive than any other animated movie I've seen this year. ""The most human movie of the year. And it doesn't star a single human"". - From Matt patches

Overall Anomalisa is one of the best animated movies of 2015. It's way better than ""Inside Out"" (In my opinion). Charlie Kaufman has done it again everyone and it's glorious."
748,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/anomalisa/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,samichsupernova,"Dec 31, 2015",9,"""Anomalisa"" is a seriously beautiful experience and a hell of a thought-provoking meditation on human loneliness and longing. It's an examination of what makes us so damaged and hurt and frail and yet capable of both love and fear in equal measure.

If you look at just the bare bones plot of this story or get too caught up in judging the narcissistic protagonist, you're missing the point. Here the devil is in the meticulous details and specificity of the emotional journey our protagonist is on. The movie's thesis really manifests in the third act which hits really hard. This isn't your typical love story. It's a story about existential crises and the paradoxical nature of love in our twisted modern age. We are all both Michael and Lisa whether we know it or not. We all just want to love and be loved. But that happiness is so hard to find in a world where, as the customer service mantra-speech Michael is set to deliver proves, people need to be reminded constantly that every person is an individual and that every individual has needs.

As might be expected from legendary scribe Charlie Kaufman, it's heavy, darkly funny, and existential as hell, but anyone expecting something as epic, layered with subtext, and intricate as his magnum opus ""Synecdoche, New York"" should be forewarned that this is almost the opposite of that film. It's very specific and intimate, almost disturbingly so, uncannily insightful in the subject of loneliness, and precise in handling its subject matter. For that reason, it may also hit harder and closer to home for most people than the labyrinthine, grandiose meta-fiction of ""Synecdoche"" (which is one of my all-time favorite films, like seriously top 3 material). In some ways this film is even more painstaking than ""Synecdoche"" because it recreates our boring old world down to the minutest detail in stop-motion animation.

I also love all the questions Mr. Kaufman posits (can we really love someone if we don't love ourselves? what is the relationship between love and attachment? where does the individual end? why do we hurt so badly and continue to hurt others if we know how badly it feels? how do we justify our selfish actions? is this really what love has become in our corporatized world?).

""Anomalisa"" is not going to please everyone and in fact it may make a lot of people uncomfortable, but ****, I loved the ever-loving hell out of its awkward, anomalous brilliance. I'm really gonna have to see this one again."

751,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/long-days-journey-into-night/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Bertaut1,"Jan 11, 2020",7,"A luminous esoteric puzzle

As unconcerned with formal conventionality as it is with narrative resolution, Long Day's Journey into Night is an esoteric puzzle made up of two distinct parts. Whilst the 2D first half is a reasonably conventional noir, the second is composed of an unbroken 50-minute 3D shot that's as aesthetically audacious as it is narratively elliptical. The second feature from Bi Gan, Long Day's Journey is aggressively enigmatic, and the absence of character arcs, the formal daring, the languorous pacing, and the resistance to anything approaching definitive conclusions, will undoubtedly see many react with equal parts bafflement and infuriation. However, if you can get past such issues and go with the film on its own terms, you'll find a fascinatingly esoteric examination of the protean nature of memory.

Long Day's Journey tells the story of Luo Hongwu (Huang Jue). In 2000, he met and had a brief but memorable relationship with the mysterious Wan Qiwen (Tāng Wéi), whom he has never been able to forget. When he returns to his home city of Kaili to bury his father, he sets about trying to track down Qiwen, as the story of their relationship is told via flashbacks. However, it soon becomes apparent that just because Lou remembers a thing doesn't necessarily mean that that thing happened. When his search leads him to a dingy movie theatre, he puts on a pair of 3D glasses and finds himself in an abandoned mine from which his only hope of escape is to win a game of ping pong. The rest of the film takes place in his dream world. Or in the 3D movie playing in the theatre. Or in an amalgamation of both. Or in something else entirely.

Long Day's Journey's biggest selling point is unquestionably the aesthetically audacious second hour. Unlike 'single-take' films such as Climax (2018), Utøya 22. Juli (2018), and 1917 (2019), which use long-takes and 'hidden' edits to give the effect of a single-shot, the second half of Long Day's Journey follows films such as Russkij Kovcheg (2002) and Victoria (2015) insofar as it was legitimately shot via one single take. And it's a complex and visually layered shot too, featuring drones, Steadicams, intricate blocking, elaborate external locations with multitudes of people, practical effects, complex interior locations, even a lengthy sequence set on a zip line. Considering the scope, it would be an impressive enough accomplishment in 2D, but that it was filmed with bulky 3D cameras is almost unbelievable.

What's especially laudable about the sequence, however, is how it never becomes gimmicky. Most movies released in 3D have no real thematic justification for being in 3D, nothing in their content to justify their form, whilst films such as Victoria have no real thematic justification for being single-shots. Long Day's Journey, however, justifies both decisions. This is a film about memory, specifically the idea that memory can be deceptive, and may have as much to do with subjective dreams as with objective reality. In this sequence, as memory, reality, and dream seem to blend into one another, Gan shows us not just the content of a dream, but the illogical texture. You replace the 3D with 2D, or you replace the single-shot with edits, and you lose that texture; the 3D/single-shot form is as important as James Joyce's removal of punctuation is in creating the impression of a mind on the brink of falling asleep in the last episode of Ulysses – restore the punctuation, and the interrelatedness of form and content is lost.

Thematically, the conventional first half of the film concerns itself not just with memory, but with the imperfect nature of memory, suggesting that obsession is nothing more than a trick of the mind, an attempt to reattain something that may never have existed in the first place. Indeed, it's worth noting that the most recurrent visual motif is that of reflection – not just in mirrors, but so too in puddles, which act as slightly more distorted (subjective?) versions of the relatively perfect reflection one gets from a mirror. So even here, one can see that Gan is examining the fault line between objectivity and subjectivity.

All of which will go some way to telling you whether or not you're likely to enjoy Long Day's Journey. It's rarely emotionally engaging in a conventional sense and the storyline is elliptical, the characters archetypal, and the themes subtle. You either embrace the emphasis on mood and tone, or you fight it. Personally, I loved its formal daring and admired Gan's confidence and the singularity of his vision, but I found each section outstayed it's welcome a little. Gan also walks a very fine line between emotional detachment and emotional alienation, and it's a line he crosses a couple of times. Nevertheless, this is an awe-inspiring technical achievement, an ultra-rare example of a film which perfectly matches form to content, and a fascinating puzzle that trades in the undefinable nuances of memory."

Di Qui Zui Hou De Ye Wan (Long Day's Journey Into Night)

Bi believes in the physicality of the storytelling. Visually, the writer and director, Gan Bi may hide plenty behind the curtain but it certainly oozes sexiness like I haven't seen in films, lately. Split into two acts, the first one has an inspiring filmmaking style to learn from. In each frame the world seems resisting or rushing towards something. It is perpetually vibrating and sensibly the camera are told to be still. This attention towards peace isn't forced but calls for it with a disturbing behaviour. Tricking us into believing how edgy or shady or abnormal the acts are. The food eaten isn't enjoyed or dives are taken dutifully instead, luxuriously.

There is often something flowing, blinking, moving, rotating, floating, burning, humming or blowing behind the staged set. This metaphor of continuation or even capturization is also transferred, latter, into audio. And when the camera stands still, the close up of someone's face mourns, silently. Now, this tells you how difficult it could be to go through a process like such. Yet, you are hooked, intrigued by not the mystery it spirals out but the romance.

The romance between the objects around it, a clock or a letter or a photograph or a book or a glass of water or a even a bat. Now as much as hefty this first act is, the second half is equally lofty and light on its feet. And I might not be the proper observer to scale that part of the film. I am gullible for one take shots. And imagine my feeling when I hit this gold mine that lasts for more than an hour. No matter how many detours then is taken I don't want this Long Day's Journey Into Night to end."

Wait, a payoff? That is right, in this glorious family film that strikes again with a vengeance. When I said the first film was like Paddington being on his own for the first time, just like a fresh high school grad goes off to college or moves into his or her own house, this one shows a secondary function when certain unexpected dilemmas can clash into you and have to think fast to get yourself out of it. Paddington works until he loses his fur to pay for a surprise book that he wants to give to his aunt for her one hundredth lap lap around the sun. He becomes treated in the opposite way of the first film: a jailed hero when mistakenly accused. There is great satire in this movie when it becomes stylized in the same way as the films acclaimed films One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and The Shawshank Redemption when there is motivation involved to inmates. Most movies do not always result the way as planned, but there is always maximum effort shown by the characters.
	I do not only see Paddington 2 as a rare sequel that is better than its predecessor, but I see it as a film that makes the characters revitalize their self-identities and hope, even if a coincidence is likely to ensue."

793,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/paddington-2/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DavidWasHere,"May 28, 2018",9,"We are too good for the Paddington films. Not only are they pure and innocent and genuinely sweet and charming, but everyone put all the care in the world with making them. From Paul King's excellent direction that not only is full of energy (there is no slow moments in the film), but also having a ton of interesting shot composition too, to the fantastic cast, with Hugh Bonneville, Sally Fields, and Jim Broadbent returning to the cast and bringing their magic and enthusiasm to the films, and of course Ben Whishaw's warmth and tenderness as the voice to the titular bear, and with the new editions of Hugh Grant and Brendan Gleeson sharing scene stealing roles, to just the writing alone teaching fantastic life lessons to younger viewers and giving older audiences not just genuine laughs but a wonderful story that gives everyone with an open heart warmth and joy. There is no cynical bone in the film's body that usually ruin kids films like this. It's just a fantastic feel good film that is well made as a movie overall! I mean the set design, art direction, and even the coloring is top notch!

Sadly, there is one major flaw with the film, the CGI. This is a complaint with the last Paddington film, because while the design of Paddington is great and there are a ton of characteristics and movements that are indeed spot on, the integration just isn't the best and often feel too unrealistic. It is not a deal-breaker as the movie is still a lot of fun regardless, but still it is a shame. Also there is a bad green-screen effect that is painfully obvious during the third act.

Regardless, this is a must see for all ages!"

800,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/paddington-2/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,PipeC,"Mar 11, 2018",9,"Possibly the best movie sequel of a family live-action pic in a long, long time.  First of all, the new installment inserts, in my opinion, a female predominance that is a little synthetic, forced and purposeful to the issues of today's women and men equality. In the opening scene, it's not papa bear who executes dangerous feats, it's Aunt Lucy, who proves to have enough guts, up to there a generous honor, however, all female sub-plots in the Brown family become erroneously comic: swimming an entire ocean or writing a men-free newspaper? Really? Fortunately, the excessive female empowerment ceases from there, and perhaps it'd have worked better if this cool load had been distributed throughout the film, the saturation of the onset didn't help at all. Moreover, the script is not exempt from showing stereotyped and traditional versions and failed comedy moments, but, they're, luckily, limited, opening the way to the eccentricities that enable it to be a family film, probably, belonging to the best of the best of the new century.

As most of the supporting plots lack a solid and credible identity, writers Simon Farnaby and Paul King opt to deposit all their narrative inventiveness in the protagonist's central plot, since, in the end, it's he who must be under the spotlight, of course, an action made possible by a three-dimensional antagonist. Hugh Grant stands in for the main role in the scenes where the bear is missing, because this villain, a funny character and peculiar enough not to surpass the barrier of the absurd, makes possible the gratifying amount of comedy situations and justifies, eloquently, the progress of the story and its corresponding junctures. The acting power not only lies on the antagonist's shoulders, we also receive charming and juicy interpretations from actors such as Peter Capaldi and Sally Hawkins, creating a dynamic pace and a fluid connection with the audience. It's important to dedicate a whole paragraph to the unexpected humor of the feature film because supported by elements previously mentioned such as cast or artistic inventiveness, it manages to be one of the best shaped, most virtuous and functional comedies of recent times. It's known that within the feasible ""Paddington"" movie franchise, the comic factor rests mostly upon the shoulders of the dewy-eyed bear, because of this we see how, amusingly, different jobs pop up through the life of the animal. With all the different variables and combinations for comedy genre, the film chooses to put one more physical and boisterous in scenes where the nice protagonist is usually the architect, in the same way, it's evident a dynamic and sincere collective charm that always derives from the interaction between the characters and the leading role. Likewise, the screenwriters are perceptive enough to interweave every funny moment with subsequent situations, in other words, the characters or actions, they perform without intent, are generally part of a humorous range bigger than the achieved with a single scene, a better result. On this occasion, the vivid colors, an innate feature of the first film, return, however, it differs, radically, because they don't end up being cloying, Erik Wilson knows how to endow a film focused on a defined-personality animal, clearly, supported by a source of inspiration, however, this doesn't devitalize the enchantment and strength of a world that makes speeches through the visual landscapes with aplomb about hope and union. A major achievement is the artistic section of the work, it's dazzling and laborious the way in which they avoid ridicule moves even having pink-dressed prisoners, a family with extravagant garments or a metropolis with serious wrapping but colorful content; every little feature is visually coherent as a whole, a polychromatic whole. It's a huge victory for family comedies. Added to the handsome cinematography, it seems incalculable the number of special effects responsible who took an active part in the film, however, based on their work on specific scenes, it's possible to give approximations with full conviction. No wonder, Paul King's ""Paddington 2"" returns to the top, materializing splendid visual wills and proposing important teachings, operations that allow it to be a compelling film for general audiences; A creative and deep-felt comedy that means a real event because it vindicates the poor quality of the most recent family flicks. As a motion picture, it borders on the critical perfection and commercially  has become a moderate hit, however, the true victory of King's movie is to conceive one of the best cinematic adventures about love, family and, could not miss the peculiarities of a charismatic kind-hearted bear; creatively surprising and narratively dynamic, we welcome a feature film that is truly worth paying for, without noticing its smell of marmalade."

The answer is no, it's mostly real human actors (good ones, too!), and the bear is so lifelike, it doesn't seem animated at all. The bear is wonderful, and you just want to hug him. If there was an award for a performance by an inanimate object, he would win it. Both Paddington1 and Paddington2 are very entertaining for adults, not just kids.

Sometimes it's nice to completely leave behind any sort of critical analysis of a film and just laugh at some crude jokes for an hour and a half. The magic wears off, however, when seemingly every new comedy is of this ilk. In times of ""dumb comedy overload,"" I have to sit back and reminisce about the first time I experienced the magic of films like Dr. Strangelove and The Naked Gun. Of course, Strangelove and nearly all of Leslie Nielsen's comedy films have plenty of dumb jokes that clearly required little thought. What separates these classic comedy films from the countless forgotten lazy, dumb, crude efforts that have fallen into the abyss of forgettable comedies is the fact that Strangelove and Naked Gun make the effort to exercise all of its writers' comedic chops. Some dumb jokes make it into the final cut, sure, but such humor is thrown into a comedic gumbo with all sorts of visual gags, clever dialogue, memorable one-liners, and a slew of characters ranging from the zaniest **** scientists to dead-pan detectives. The mix of elements is what makes such films timeless; The Death of Stalin is one of those films.

The subject matter is simple: Stalin has died, and his underlings now must compete in a political king of the hill in order to claim power. Anyone with an elementary background in European history will know who ultimately succeeds, but it sure is a trip watching these historic figures bumble their way through necessary proceedings to get what they want. There is no one stand out performance as each cast member brings his or her own brand of humor to the table. Everyone gets a turn, and everyone delivers. Not every joke is a gut-wrencher; in fact, I chuckled more than I roared laughing. I doubt I even caught all of the jokes, as I was often too busy chuckling at a previous gag. For once, I enjoyed a barrage of comedy that did not build up to one big payoff but rather made the effort to keep me smiling and thoroughly entertained.

I do not want to spoil any jokes, as I myself was able to appreciate a spoiler-free experience and am grateful for such an experience, so I will make this review brief. Surprisingly accurate historical accounts and a mixed bag of gags, one-liners, and situational comedy make The Death of Stalin a refreshingly intelligent and hard-working 2018 comedy that gives its audience glimpses of influence from some of the greatest comedies in film."
827,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-death-of-stalin/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,AugustKeller,"Jun 4, 2018",8,"Some may be disturbed by its dark humor but the brutal honesty that The Death of Stalin is able to get across while poking fun at the absurdities of the situation is a feat to behold. Never too cheeky and just cruel enough, this film balances its tone through its brilliant acting and clever writing. From the mind of Armando Iannucci and given to the experienced cast of Steve Buscemi, Jeffery Tambor and Simon Beale; this is a movie that oozes with craft. Mixing gags with horrific moments, The Death of Stalin‘s ambition is only matched by its wit as it takes its viewers through the wild ride of top political power movement and shows off the mixed motivations of its devious characters.

As many comedies do, The Death of Stalin sometimes lacks mind-blowing effects or a surplus of artful camerawork but that is more than made up for with razor-sharp humor. This film’s way of pointing out the extremes people will go to for power, manipulation or fear (in a word: politics) is impossible to ignore. This movie achieves every goal that a charged, political comedy wants to achieve because it gets honorable laughs and also leaves viewers with poignant food for thought. Simply put, The Death of Stalin is political satire done right.

I especially loved the presentation of the movie, with the scene fading to black some times and lines from the Soviet constitution appearing, and the slow-mo to introduce characters. It lightened the mood, which was necessary to balance the more dark aspects of the movie."

This is great political commentary drowned with black humor. This film should be taught at school because it contains great truth value of how most bureaucracy and organizations work. Forget about what your political leanings are, this is a great film about human nature at its core."

The hilarious performances, strong historical themes and Iannucci’s direction help elevate this story past satire into being both an outrageous comedy and dissection of Russian politics. This film should not have worked given the topic and yet Iannucci found a way to make something hysterical and memorable."

The energy level stays high but sometimes veers out of control leaving the viewer trying to decipher what is being said in scenes of chaotic shouting. Steve Buscemi is always compelling and scene-stealing on screen. Jeffrey Tambor and Michael Palin are both hilarious. Worth seeing if you’re interested in the subject matter but it does occasionally get down in the Soviet history weeds with some of the jokes and asides."
833,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-death-of-stalin/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,KeithDow,"Apr 12, 2018",8,"'The Death of Stalin' is the kind of film that makes you want to climb inside the head of the writer/director--in this case Armando Iannucci--and probe all the little dials and sprockets and gears to see what makes him tick.

Iannucci somehow manages to create a wholly original and surreal work of power-mongering satire steeped in dark humor and absurdism while perfectly blending together the largely true events surrounding Stalin's death.

Add to that a powerhouse cast of dry comedy and improvisation, including Jeffrey Tambor, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Palin, combined with magnificent settings, and 'The Death of Stalin' immediately becomes this year's hidden gem of the season."
834,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-death-of-stalin/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TVJerry,"Apr 5, 2018",8,"The titular event takes place early in the story, which leaves the remaining government officials in a frantic struggle for power. While there are moments of the evil that pervaded the USSR at that time, most of the narrative gets its thrust from the mean-spirited dark humor that writer/director Armando Iannucci does so well (he created VEEP). The cast has a great time conniving and conspiring against each other, while fighting to secure their place in the new regeime. The spirited satire provides intellectual laffs, even though the comic momentum slows before it's over. Still, it's witty and entertaining in an art house way."

Every single acting performance was really top-notch and satirical. It was also nice to see Michael Palin doing work again! Every shot is meticulously crafted, as if you are watching a historical epic, but the profane humor gives this an excellent contrast. It's very easy to see the parallels between a post-Stalin Russia and the current Trump America. Fans of dark comedies, farces, history, and political thrillers are really going to enjoy this one.

Iannucci has produced a delightfully buoyant account of the mad grab for power in the days following Stalin's death that captures the absurdity and hubris of those closest to him which, without shielding the atrocities from the viewer, sets a tone that allows the audience to laugh along at the sheer Machiavellian complexities on display. With excellent performances from the ensemble cast, and beautiful set design providing a sumptuous backdrop to the riveting storyline, this is a funny and irreverent experience that is  thoroughly enjoyable. 8.78/10"
844,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-death-of-stalin/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MeritCoba,"Mar 9, 2018",9,"I have not been much interested in Stalin, even though he is an pivotal figure in history, but for his death. The events surrounding his death (and the struggle for power that ensues) made me think of the death of Tiberius, the Roman emperor who succeeded Augustus and was succeeded in turn by Caligula. There are similarities there, even though Tiberius struck me as the more sympathetic ruler of the two. One moment especially made the connection, Tiberius lies on his deathbed, but he suddenly seems to come back to life. Caligula, who has taken the signet ring from the emperor's hand, cringes, pleads and begs his excuses. The emperor falls back on to the bed and is finally definitely dead. Another version has the head of the guard choke the emperor to death. Almost a similar moment can be found in this movie when Stalin seems momentarily to recover, making Beria, head of the security services, cringe and terrified as well. He was already setting in motion the takeover of power. Something the dictator might not see in a favorable light.

The movie is a terrible movie, for it shows what shocking terror the people in the Soviet Union had to live with under this most abject of rulers. And even though it might look over the top, reading up on sources will show you that it was like that. There is a danger to compare him to ****, that other abject ruler but let's not go into that. The terror can be felt in every scene and one of the shocking moments sees the entire house of Stalin being emptied by security forces and most of the staff and guards get shot by other guards. Beria's orders do not even spare his own men. Nobody is safe. The scene ends with a truck driving off with the guard ordering it to drive away getting shot in the head by another guard.

The movie is positioned as a comedy and a drama, and even though there is a certain comedy, mostly very dark, at no point is this cheap or over the top. Point in case is the opening scene. We witness the end of concert which is broadcast by a radio station. The phone rings: it is Stalin. He instructs the man to ring him back in 17 minutes. Terrified the man calls back and is then instructed to deliver a recording of the concert to dictator. But they did not record the event. And panic ensues as they redo the concert as to record it and, of course, everything goes wrong. It is funny in a way, but the underlying terror and dread is palpable. You might think this is all not real, but we know from history that Stalin actually did this. The acting is superb and I cannot actually say who takes the cake here, Buscemi is excellent as Khrushchev, Beale matches his with his portrayal of Beria. But also Tambor makes a marvelous role as weak Malenkov and Palin does a nice job as sycophant Molotov. My opinion is that one should invent an oscar for the best group of actors in a movie. My vote would be for this movie.

If there is a crucial moment in the movie then it is the moment that Beria, losing grip on the situation, threatens the other members of the Central Committee. You could feel that it would backfire. And we see how Khrushchev makes use of the moment in a marvelous but, for him no doubt, nerve-wracking manner.

The movie is an incredible well done teamwork and I love it is done by people like Buscemi, Tambor and Beale. Give actors a good script and they pull it off. This is how movies should be. It is why I often blame the badness of movies not on the actors, but on the director and the script. I would almost give this one a ten. The reason I don't give it a 10 is because the movie takes shortcuts with history. A cursory glance says that some of the events did not happen that way. Just read up on Beria's death."

Sometimes funny, sometimes dark funny. But there is also a very tragic side since this is also history. Good pacing and extremely well timed editing. It is very much an adult theme movie, since the brutality of the regime is well depicted. I give it a 80%. Just for the actors performances is worth the price alone."

It flips from dark and grim to witty and hilarious in a matter of seconds. Honestly not everyone is going to enjoy The Death of Stalin but it’s a gem.

A truly brilliant script and wonderfully directed by Armando Iannucci. An excellent cast all round, particularly from Steve Buscemi and Jason Isaacs. They really can do no wrong.

The writing is just perfect. The characters are all very unique, while non of them are pure perfection or pure evil. My favourite character is Bill, he seemed to be the nicest person, who didn't always complain even though he probably had the biggest problem. This movie is definitely about character drama, but the dialogues are extremely funny and I loved that. The plot is also very intriguing.

The cinematography is gorgeous, I loved the landscape shots. The production design is vivid and colourful. The pacing is perfect, I didn't want the movie to end, it never felt boring. The score is also beautiful. The acting performances were spectacular. Woody Harrelson was my favourite, while Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell were outstanding too.

Very Coen-esque, and not just in that it stars Frances McDormand, who's appeared in several of their films and is actually married to one of the brothers. Most notable is the way director/screenwriter Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) gets us familiar with dozens of rounded, colorful characters, fleshes them out and makes us care about how their paths intertwine. Or, in most cases, how they collide, break apart and ricochet into the next unsuspecting object. This really gets going in the second act, when a core character makes a profound decision that results in a solid hour of nonstop chain reactions.

But it's not all dark gristle and angry monologues. Often, it works as an effective black comedy, which I realize is a tough thing to recognize after admitting it's about a **** investigation. Such tension-breakers are crucial, though, to keep us from getting too bogged down in the solemnity of it all, and to maintain a sense of momentum.

Wonderfully shot, with plenty of time dedicated to exploring the beat-up small town at the center of all the drama, it's also expertly paced, brilliantly acted and continuously surprising. A deserved favorite for the Oscars."

866,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,FilipeNeto,"Jan 23, 2022",10,"This is an undoubtedly tense film, in which the story of an unsolved murder serves as the backdrop for a much deeper and more elaborate drama, in which the victim's inconsolable mother seeks, by all means, to force the police to seriously investigate what happened to his daughter. It's not the first film where the police are seen as villains, but it's far from being a lighthearted film, with friendly heroes and execrable villains. The film strives to create and highlight the nuances of the plot and each of the characters.

I remember perfectly that this film was one of the heavyweights of the 2018 Oscars, and one of the great candidates for the Oscar for Best Picture. It didn't win the statuette, nor a good part of the nominations received, but it left the Dolby Theater with two awards in important categories: Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor. Personally, I believe that the film would also have been a fair deserving of the award for Best Original Screenplay, since the differential of the film, for me, is to give us a script with an elegant and well done story, with drama and depth, and in that each character deserved a close look and an interesting development. The biggest problem with this incredible script turns out to be, in fact, the open ending and the feeling that it doesn't give the audience the conclusion they expect to see. It's not about wanting a happy ending... it's just about wanting an end point and not just ellipses.

In the wake of the story of the unsolved crime and the billboards, we observe the tense relationship and mutual misunderstandings between mother and daughter, and the way that mother feels remorse for the way she acted with her murdered daughter. We see how the police want to act, but they can't for lack of evidence, for being forced to follow the law and not being able to simply arrest everything and everyone or treat each one as a suspect. We see how honest and potentially good men can be lost if they do not have an opportunity to improve their conduct, and how there are indeed people who are committed to their work, despite the criticism they receive. And we see how, at times, the voice of the people can be more caustic and unfair than any other.

Martin McDonagh is a new director, who many didn't know well before this film. I had seen one of his films before, ""Bruges"", and he really improved a lot, not only as a director, but even as a screenwriter. Frances McDormand presents us a complete, intense, committed and powerful performance, which holds us from beginning to the end. Needless to say, it was probably her life's greatest work, and that it would be an injustice of titanic proportions not to reward it fairly, as it did. But she doesn't carry the film alone: Woody Harrelson is also very good here, in a difficult character that gives the film an added density. He also gave us, in this film, the best of himself. But even more powerful and intense is the work of Sam Rockwell, an actor I've never seen work at this level, and who was truly impressive in the way he grabbed the character and gave it body and density. The film also has satisfactory collaborations with Peter Dinklage (an actor who was not always treated well in the films he was in, despite being very good at what he does) and Caleb Jones.

Technically, the film is truly a quality parade. Let's start by looking at its elegant cinematography. With an exquisite work of filming and very well executed, the film has excellent colors, sharpness, framing and makes the best use of the beautiful filming locations where it was made. I especially enjoyed some shots at dusk, where the sunlight gives the scene a poignant nostalgia. The editing was equally well done, and the cuts are not even felt. The sets were very well done and are full of details, and I would highlight the police station or the store where Mildred works. Finally, we have to talk about the soundtrack, sad and introspective, signed by Carter Burwell, and the wise inclusion of the song ""Last Rose of Summer"" by the incredible voice of Renee Fleming, the icing on the cake in those opening scenes."

There are some plot twists and its a fairly thoughtful film too. Well worth a watch - I'd recommend this."

Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is faced with a very difficult task; the movie must present its heavy subject matter in a way that neither obscures the piece’s value nor makes too light of the content. The movie handles issues like discrimination, vigilante justice, and sexual assault with much care. This said, amidst cancer, arson, and ****, the movie has a heart and brevity, it isn’t all sticks and stones. As was mentioned previously, the cast of characters all feel authentic and bound within the town of Ebbing. They give well-oiled performances, but Frances McDormand especially portrays a tortured mother, someone so filled with grief and hatred that she comes off as ruthless and inhuman. Despite her initial outward appearance, McDormand’s character, like many of the others in the film, is deeply multi-faceted and is constantly struggling to balance the many of life’s challenges thrown her way. The shot composition, score and cinematography were all well done and fitting, but the writing and casting make this movie as good as it is."

The film came out on 2016 and has been regarded as a cult classic ever since. It tells the story of Mildred, a mother of two whose daughter had been murdered and ****; as there is a lack of interest from the local police on the murder of her daughter she decides to take justice in her own hands and push the police to restart the investigation in the form of three billboards with messages against the chief of the town. Little does she know that everything will go off the rails from there….

The movie on itself is a pretty worthwhile experience, there is plenty of good acting, specially from the main leads played by Frances McDormand (in probably her best performance to date) and Sam Rockwell. Their characters, despite having differences on their perception of justice, manage to deliver a solid and believable hate relationship that evolves in such a natural scheme that you find yourself astonished on how almost perfectly everything plays out for them at the end of the film. There is always a feeling of unpredictability to it, you never know where the story is going to go, you could certainly say that most of the movie is composed of plot-twists but it is mind-blowing to know that they don't feel forced at any moment as the story progresses with a pretty light pace without feeling over-stuffed during its whole runtime.

The technical aspects are breathtaking, McDonagh proves to be a masterful director once again with a familiar story that takes a bizarre approach to its subject matter. There is plenty to enjoy from masterful directing to a beautiful soundtrack composed of country and classic music that turn Three Billboards into a remarkable craft. Motherhood, vengeance, redemption and regret are only a handful of the themes touched in Three Billboards. The emotional parts hit you hard most of the time because everything about it feels so authentic, it is an amazing work of passion. Conclusion: Three Billboards is probably the best movie to come out on 2017 and its impact will remain as one of the most heartbreaking black comedies of the decade, the conflict feels real and the characters, the heart of the film, make it worth a watch."

The emotional scenes where just simply a masterpiece and they delivered the feelings of sorrow, love, vengeance and anger in such a meaningful and artistic way. The director's style and choice in cinematography is simply something Iv'e never seen before. Fresh and very well executed. The movie is such an entertaining piece and it keep the tension high all the way through with it's amazing unforeseen events and turns that it depicts the struggle of real life perfectly. The shadiness and lies and every single detail was outstandingly executed. The characters are just so perfectly written and acted and such complex personalities with profound moral codes that it is hard to even start to comprehend yet still believable, because it strongly reflects the reality to much. The emotional power this movie has is just amazing. The music also helped the impeccable immersion and tension. The situations our main characters are presented with and interacting with each other are often grotesque. But the humor and funny situations are very well delivered as well. I honestly had gags in one minute and tears in my eyes the other minute. It's literally like a lifeline of emotional overwhelming project. Overall it's an amazing movie which it's a must watch if you can stomach the drama genre. It was always a 10/10 masterpiece but the conclusion and ending was a bit lack luster which cut right before the apex of the events. None the less the message is clear and strong visiting true problems in the world. AMAZING!!!!"

At times watching this I felt scenes play out in a way that is somewhat disjointed from itself...(lead character burning the police station?).

The leading role is one of the strongest of the year, a woman who desperately seeks justice and revenge for her daughter´s death. The film reflects the many flaws of our society and leaves us thinking about the different possibilities and the many things in life we can do to take one direction or the opposite. Also, that very often, things are left unresolved and one has to live with it. Homophobia, racism, cruelty, hypocrisy, and many other sides of human beings are tackled here. And not one main character is left out of that. Especially interesting the arc for one of the police officer´s character, played by Sam Rockwell. Frances carries the film perfectly too as only she knows. It doesn´t feel like something especially new or artistic, but it wins us with its unpredictable nature and entertainment value."

1-The characters aren't angels or demonds. All the protagonists have good and bad things. You know, like most humans! This shouldn't be such a rarity, but it totally is!

2-The funny parts (not always done to make laugh out loud, which is the way it should be) do not require ""out of character"" stuff. Everything that is funny its really the logical conclusion of the funny situations the characters are in, and their normal responses. That's why this deserves a lot of praise for the writing, which is insanely good (except for a couple of huge mistakes)

3-Then there's the drama/story which is perfectly paced and it has social commentary, but I'm not sure that part is neither revolutionary nor especially interesting. Its good.

The acting is pretty great overall.

Now the gripes: -There is a particularly female character that is treated like a ""slow person"" for no apparent reason other than some might laugh at her. It seems malicious more than social commentary on that type of person. Because she isn't a person, really, the way she's writen. -The Friends of our ""hero?"" are DIVERSE. Its too on the nose, and really not particularly interesting giving that they won't even be characters (they do little to nothing). They are ""token black guy"", only they aren't a black guy.

Had I known it was written and directed by Mia Hanson-Love I might have decided to stay well away - after being disappointed by the 2011 ‘Goodbye First Love’. But, with this surprisingly mature work, she has taken her own family experiences and crafted a story so filled with thoughtful observations the viewer feels more like a voyeur - within the unfolding lives of these very real characters. I kept expecting the now common clichés to start unfolding i.e.; lonely deserted wife seeks solace in a carnal relationship - but surprisingly and pleasingly, all superficial TV and cinema modernisms are avoided in preference to intelligent character study. Being raised in a home with two philosophy teachers as parents, Mia Hansson-Love uses in-depth philosophy to examine her central theme/s. Nathalie, her main character, illustrates strong points by telling her family, acquaintances, and students, that in her youth she had been surrounded by Stalinists but, she read Solzhenitsyn (who exposed many vague notions about the ‘idealism’ of the USSR!). Without labouring her points, she invites her students and anarchist friends to think for themselves, even lifting a veil against the trendy leanings of Post Modernism. She freely quotes the philosophies of Rousseau and Gunther Anders (might any of this had an influence on the avoidance of sensationalised clichés within the intelligence level of Love’s script...I wonder?)  With succinct statements Nathalie invites them to recognise the positive points of right and wrong with an open mind. This is a woman grounded in pure realism - even though, beyond her control, some elements that have constituted her world till now are beginning to alter.

If I may have questioned anything it could have been the resolve with which she accepts some of her situations – she says to her husband and the father of her children; “I thought you would love me forever” - then simply, without even questioning his leaving her, goes along with it. This could be the reaction of someone who was expecting the situation, but to one who thought all was well....I’m not so sure. Nathalie is superbly played by Isabelle Huppert and supported by a well-chosen cast who, take us on a slice-of-life journey that’s reminiscent of some of Bergman’s better works – examining the intimate challenges that life brings into most all our paths - without trivializing or cheapening the experience. The careful selection & use of music is evident (as with earlier works) adding to the soundly grounded profundity of this enlightening cinematic achievement. The fluid imagery of prolific cinematographer Denis Lenoir (Still Alice ‘14) is not always suited to subtitled topics but one imagines the budget and subject would have dictated this style – so, some may find viewing and reading could need a little concentration at times. Still, the rewards are well worth any efforts necessary to stay with this strong and satisfying work."

926,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-star-is-born/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,kyle20ellis,"Mar 13, 2022",8,"Had heard nothing but great things about this latest 'A Star is Born' film, with even my own sister saying it was a must see. There was also the interest to see how Lady Gaga would fare in her acting debut and how Bradley Cooper would fare as first-time director. Decided to see it when taking a break from practise with nothing else better to do, going in with very high expectations, as part of my ""seeing as many 2018 films as possible"" quest.

This is not the only, or first, 'A Star is Born' film. There is one from 1937 with Mitzi Gaynor and Fredric March, my personal favourite. There is one from 1954, the most famous, which is overlong but does contain Judy Garland's best ever performance and terrific songs (especially the heart-wrenching ""The Man That Got Away""), love James Mason in it too. There is the 1976 film with Barbra Streisand, personally don't care for it but Streisand sings beautifully and ""Evergreen"" is to die for.

As far as the versions of 'A Star is Born' goes, this one from 2018 compares extremely favourably. Not quite as good as the 1937 film, but on the same level as 1954 and better than 1976. May not love it as much as others, but the appeal is justified and the acclaim is deserved from my personal perspective. In terms of films from 2018, 'A Star is Born' is among the better ones.

It's not perfect. A few story elements are a touch rushed and lack credibility, like Ally getting stage spotlight in such a short space of time, and occasionally it's a little on-the-nose like the making Ally glitzier advice from Rez.

The final act also could have been tightened, slightly too padded and dragged out.

What 'A Star is Born' does so well is taking a familiar story and making it still fresh and relatable. It's always entertaining and glamorous yet the love story is every bit as important, and even more so, and is both charming and emotionally impactful. Everything about 'A Star is Born' is slick, endlessly entertaining and with lots of heart and surprising poignancy, also had the experience of not a dry eye being in the auditorium with tears silently rolling with me.

Visually, it's very eye catching and sumptuously made, beautifully shot with lots of glitzy glamour and style. Loved the songs, none are quite on the same level as ""The Man That Got Away"" and ""Evergreen"" but they are extremely well written, easy to remember, have a wide range of emotions, are very well sung and staged, are integrated beautifully integrated into the story, some moving the story forward or telling it through the song rather than being a grinding things to a halt distraction. ""I'll Never Love Again"" and ""Shallow"" stand out.

Dialogue has wit and heart and the story shines particularly in the first third. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, with Lady Gaga providing a contender for the most surprising performances of the year in a quite outstanding acting debut (her singing is also absolutely great of course), a star is born indeed. Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances as a charismatic and charming yet conflicted leading man, do not associate him with musicals and worried as to whether he would fit but it fits him like a glove. He too directs for the first time, and it is hard to believe that a directing job this slick and audacious was only his debut, really do disagree about his contributions being a vanity project with so much effort being put into everything. There is fine support from particularly Sam Elliott and the chemistry between the two leads is wholly believable.

Altogether, very, very good and often splendid. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

Its a little formulaic I suppose but the performances were very good and the music was especially enjoyable, both in terms of energetic live performances and also with numerous scenes showing the two main characters in quieter, low key settings (at home, outside in the dark etc.) where they sing to each other, so it's certainly still worth seeing. There's some good cinematography and I liked that it has perhaps a more modern feel to it, with the drag club setting and one or two plot points being representative of modern times.

More importantly, it's their love story is a beautiful combination of perfect chemistry and wonderful performances. Gaga is astounding with charisma and subtlety that's continually captivating. Of course, her singing (done live) is spectacular (the song's are strong too). This is probably Cooper's best performance, he lays out his character with magnetism and raw emotion. Being an accomplished actor pays off when it came to Cooper directing the film. Not only has he elicited poignant moments from every member of the cast (with lots of lingering closeups), he's skillfully created an appealing narrative (the strong script helps). My only complaint is that the ending, although sad, didn't move me. Otherwise, this film features 2 wonderfully-compelling performances in a truly touching love story"

I haven't seen any of the earlier films, so I started refreshing with the latest version.

The film has wonderful moments, but also its weaknesses. Towards the end everything drags on and is not quite as magical as it was at the beginning.

Actually it is really very high level, especially from Bradley Cooper, who (understandably) already puts Lady Gaga in her place, even if Lady Gaga's acting is really good.

From a vocal point of view, logically the reverse case. I also have to say that I never really followed Lady Gaga with interest, but you just have to bow to her voice, there is a lot of heart and love for music behind all the pop and all the extravagance.

The film didn't become a masterpiece, but Lady Gaga's song Shallow ... really nice. I can only recommend the Star Wars parody ""A Star Wars Is Born"".

Overall, a piece of film worth seeing."

957,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hamilton-2020/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,RefinedInsights,"Aug 16, 2024",10,"I’ll admit it: I’m not the biggest fan of rap or early American history. In fact, I was practically dragged by my friends to see *Hamilton*, convinced I was in for a dull evening of revisionist history set to rap music, something akin to the parody work I'd seen in commercials over the years. I could not have been more wrong. What followed was a completely unexpected, jaw-dropping experience that left me utterly captivated.From the very first note, *Hamilton* knocked me flat. The music—each song more powerful than the last—was nothing short of phenomenal. Every track was pure gold, and I was astonished by how the story was brilliantly crafted, weaving together history, emotion, and a sense of urgency that made the tale of Alexander Hamilton feel anything but boring. The choreography and dancing were mind-blowing, with every move executed flawlessly and filled with deeper meaning. The creativity and symbolism infused into every scene were remarkable, offering layers of depth that took the entire production to another level. I was genuinely blown away. Hamilton wasn’t just a musical—it was an experience, one that stayed with me long after the final curtain. Since watching it, I’ve found myself replaying the songs in my head daily, and I now listen to the soundtrack almost every day. This modern masterpiece has earned its place alongside the classics I grew up with, like Grease, Fiddler on the Roof, Mamma Mia, and West Side Story. I never thought we’d see another musical of that caliber emerge in this day and age, but Hamilton is as close to a modern-day classic as you can get. The sheer originality of every song, the ingenuity behind bringing historical figures to life, and the way it transformed what could have been a dry, historical recounting into something vivid and captivating was awe-inspiring. I can’t recommend Hamilton enough. Having waited 10 years to see it, I now only regret not watching it sooner."

I like a good musical, although I suppose im somewhat less keen on theatre shows. I thought most of the songs were quite catchy and fun and the choreography is undoubtedly slick. It has a nice flow to it. I knew it was quite contemporary, in terms of the musical styles/genres used, including some rap/hip-hop (though there are numbers which are slower and less frantic) and I supppose it does give it a fresh feel, so to speak. I can only imagine how much energy you need to appear on stage and take part in only some of this nearly 3 hour long production. Phew. It's certainly an entertaining watch. I can't say I followed the story it tells fully but I get the general idea. I can understand why this is so popular - it definitely has a 'toe-tap' aspect to it, which is a good sign.

I wouldn't say this is entirely amazing or anything but if your a fan of musicals and this sounds of interest, then yes, I'd recommend it as a  live version of a theatrical production, rather than a film set to music as such (if you know what I mean). Its quite long at close to 2 and three quarter hours long but its certainly got a nice beat to it throughout and I thought it was pretty entertaining overall and as I say I'm not someone esp. keen on theatre. Perhaps this isn't entirely brilliant but it's certainly not boring or overly bad, hence it's worth a watch."

There are so many musical styles and influences on display here. It's not just rapping about the founding fathers.

Of course the show is great, but I want to comment on the production as a film. I was blown away by the direction and editing that manages to deliver the theater experience while always giving the audience the best seat in the **** better! The on-stage closeups and multiple camera angles are things that simply can't be experienced in the theater, and they are woven seamlessly into the performance.

989,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hamilton-2020/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,notor12,"Jul 8, 2020",7,"So I'm going to review Hamilton from a historical accuracy perspective here. Yes, I""m gonna be that guy. This will probably not be a popular opinion, so feel free to ignore me if this kind of thing bothers you:

1) Hamilton was not pulled up by his own bootstraps like the musical suggests.

Yes, he was an orphan born out of wedlock, but he was adopted by an incredibly rich merchant in what is now Kits and Nevis at a young age. That merchant paid for Hamilton to go to one of the more prestigious schools in New York in his teens (What is now Columbia University). He was not really an immigrant any more than the other colonists were....Before the revolution British colonists all over the Americas had a sort of collectively shared identity, including those in the Caribbean colonies....

They all identified as British, and generally all those white British males thought white British males were the pinnacle of human civilization. They had to believe that to justify colonization at all. They wanted white British males to have lots of freedoms that weren't afforded to people who weren't white British males and they wrote the U.S. Constitution to reflect that, to protect their freedoms but not those of other people they viewed as inferior and who were therefore subject to exploitation at their leisure. Sorry, but that's just how it was, and anyone portraying it otherwise is just not telling the truth about what happened.

There wasn't some secret hidden agenda to extend the same protections enshrined for themselves to other's freedoms at some later date as they wrote this document. That just was not on anyone's mind at the time, and there is no evidence to support that the framers secretly had that motive at all. That modern retelling of the narrative of the country's founding is completely made up for today's propaganda purposes, and the Hamilton musical was definitely indulging that fantasy a whole lot throughout.

2) Hamilton also would not have sniffed American high society without his wealthy adopted father's contacts and money and connections to fellow wealthy American merchant capitalists. Why does the musical seem to pretend this did not happen?

He did not come to the colonies to ""find himself,"" he came to go to school and hobnob with power players in the colonies at his adoptive father's behest. I feel like this misleading portrayal was once again trying to sell people on the idea of an American Dream which wasn't even really true to begin with....That we somehow don't have a mostly-closed aristocracy (when we definitely do) and that inter-class mobility is much more possible than it actually is under these conditions. Perhaps other people in history do embody that narrative of America, but Alexander Hamilton did not.

3) Hamilton also was generally not opposed to slavery and participated in the slave trade himself. He did not own slaves because he was an urbanite who didn't have use for them, but he made purchases of slaves for his family members. He was not an abolitionist.

It's a great musical as a musical, but like most biopics/dramatizations it doesn't tell the honest story of the person and their privileges that helped get them where they **** failing to tell that story it doesn't give an honest representation of the founding of the country either, because the country was shaped by the values and interests of a few people including Alexander Hamilton, wrong or right.

That's the problem with using real people in a story meant to sell tickets. Real life isn't glamorous enough, and hero worship often disappoints when you get to really know someone."

994,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hamilton-2020/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Davrosdaleks1,"Jul 6, 2020",10,"This is a filmed recording of the hit musical Hamilton, a musical about first Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton featuring a predominantly Hispanic and African American cast and hip-hop music mixed with other styles. From what I understand, it mixes footage from a live performance and separately filmed close-ups. This is a wonderful show!

The story in this is an engrossing look at one man's life and death, his tremendous highs and lows. Besides being dramatic, the clever lines in this can also be pretty funny.

The songs in this are truly unique. This presentation shows why Hamilton is the biggest musical of the decade. It accomplishes something that appears to be rarer and rarer in recent decades: every song is a winner. This is especially impressive since this is a song-only musical with basically no spoken dialogue.

The one part of this show that could be an issue for some is that singing and exposition can go by pretty quickly, especially in the first fifteen minutes, and you could miss something.

The choreography and staging are also great, not to mention very creative at times. The dancing really accentuates the story and songs. The set rather than changing scenes takes the minimalist route of having one basic set and the use of body movement, props, and a couple other stage aspects in order to tell the story. It's all so complex and fascinating to watch.

The performances in this are top-notch all-around. I've heard and seen a lot of comments that Lin Manuel-Miranda (the lead and creator of this) isn't as strong a singer as the rest of the cast, however it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. (Though by now, I'm sure plenty of people on stage have.) He just pulls off the man's drive so well in such a passionate manner. Going back to the show's sense of humor and unique interpretations, we are treated to a couple of delightfully flamboyant turns from Daveed Diggs and Johnathan Groff (from Frozen and Mindhunters).

The nice thing about this compared to seeing the show live on stage is that the close-up shots allow you to truly get a good look at the actors' expressions. (Though once in a while since the blocking is done in relation to talking in the direction of an audience, the actors can be facing the camera at an odd angle. It's not a big issue.)

Overall, I can not recommend this tremendous work enough."

Yes. Now to go a bit further into it. Not only had I actively avoided Hamilton before it's Disney+ release, but I also met idea of the show with a healthy dose of cynicism. I've long been a fan of music theatre who had grown increasingly aggravated by the form. So, Hamilton explodes across the pop culture landscape at a time when I was least receptive to the idea. That is to say that I went into the experience not as a fan and not even a neutral, but I was resigned to watch the show as it had finally become an inevitability.

I was foolish. The Hamilton film is not perfect. The sound balance is not quite where I wanted it. That could be written off by my equipment had limitations. Being a historical-based musical, it’s susceptible to criticisms of its omissions or things warped to serve story. Elephant in the room addressed, the founding fathers were great men who did terrible things. The show serves as an entry point. You are then free to research and make your assumptions but Miranda lifts them off the oil paintings. While it may not rightfully call all the characters to the carpet for there worst qualities, it is a far less sanitary depiction than the one we’re taught in school.  As for the positive, of which there many, Miranda’s love and reverence of musical theatre shines through the heavy use of themes and motifs. To call it “the hip-hop musical” is a bit disingenuous. A far more accurate description is that it is contemporary in a true form as opposed to the type of musicals that often receive that label.

The genres of music are a rich tapestry that reflects itself in the cast itself. Tommy Kail knows the show from all angles and his film direction solidified that. While it’s difficult, if not impossible to completely recreate the live experience, this is still my preferred method of viewing musical films.

The energy of production will leap from tv or your computer or your phone. Whatever your means of ingesting entertainment may be, I highly recommend that you do. While it took me five years to come around to the idea of Hamilton, the wait was worth it. The hype is certainly real."

A great and forceful film by director Samuel Maoz."
1007,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/foxtrot/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Bertaut1,"Mar 15, 2019",7,"A fascinating political allegory

Part satirical allegory, part surrealist indictment, Foxtrot finds writer/director Samuel Maoz working with similar themes as he did in Lebanon (2009), especially the ridiculous nature of war and the meaninglessness of giving one's life in the service of one's country. However, whereas Lebanon was set entirely in a Centurion tank, Foxtrot expands Moaz's thematic concerns to take in the grief and anguish of those who have lost children to military service. Much like Lebanon, Foxtrot is an intensely political film, and much like Lebanon, it has met with controversy in Israel, where it has been accused of slandering the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). As aesthetically impressive as it is politically divisive, the film is a savage condemnation of both a national psyche and a military mindset that trades on the most binary of them-versus-us dichotomies.

Divided into three distinct sections, the film tells the story of Michael Feldman (a superb Lior ****), who learns that his son Jonathan, a conscript in the IDF, has been killed ""in the line of duty"", only to learn several hours later that a mistake had been made and Jonathan is alive and well. The film then jumps several days back to a forlorn desert checkpoint on Israel's northern border (codename Foxtrot) manned by a group of wet-behind-the-ears soldiers, including Jonathan (Yonaton Shiray). The most action the group see is raising the barrier to let a camel amble through and checking the IDs of the few Palestinians who pass by. Without spoiling anything, the third section, which is kind of an extended coda, then returns to the Feldman apartment six months after the opening scenes.

In Foxtrot, Maoz uses allegory to deconstruct Israeli national myths. Interrogating what he sees as a culture of denial born from a reluctance to deal with the morality and sustainability of being an occupying force, the film gets a lot of mileage out of the metaphor of the foxtrot - a dance where no matter where you go, if you follow the steps correctly, you end up back at the starting point. Maoz is suggesting that without taking great care, countries will repeat the errors of the past, ending up exactly where they once were. Speaking to the Globe and Mail, Maoz explains, ""Foxtrot deals with the open wound or bleeding soul of Israeli society. We dance the foxtrot; each generation tries to dance it differently but we all end up at the same starting point.""

In a more concrete sense, in a scene at Foxtrot, the film examines the casual sadism and unspoken racism that can arise from serving in the armed forces of a country perpetually at war. Making a Palestinian couple stand in the pouring rain whilst their antiquated computer checks the couple's IDs, the soldiers don't care that they couple are dressed for a formal night, or that by the time they are cleared, their clothes are destroyed, as is her hair, and makeup. The scene is brilliantly staged, agonisingly realistic, and takes place in real-time, with Maoz concentrating on the couple looking at one another across the roof of the car, conveying agonised helplessness, compromised innocence, and, most saliently, abject humiliation. It's a masterclass in dialogue-free storytelling, and deeply political storytelling at that.

Aesthetically, Maoz shoots each of the three sections differently; the first is restrictive, trapping us in the confined headspace of the Feldmans, with the intense emotionality constantly threatening to boil over; the vast wide-open vistas of the second part contrast sharply with the confinement of the first, with the entire section threaded through with surrealism; the third section is darker than the others (in a literal sense), with a stark visual design that emphasises only those elements that are important to the scene. The Feldman apartment itself is extremely angular, and although it's very spacious, cinematographer Giora Bejach shoots it in such a way as to appear oppressively box-like.

Foxtrot won't be for everyone. Some will take issue with the pacing (which, it has to be said, is extremely languid), some with the allegorical nature of the story, some with the film's politics. For everyone else, however, this is a brilliantly realised tragedy, dealing with the randomness of pain and loss in a country refusing to recognise its past. Critiquing the xenophobic mindset that has crept into the Israeli zeitgeist, Maoz has been accused of making an ""anti-Israel narrative."" On the contrary, he is pleading with his country to change its ways, or it will repeat the errors of history. This is the act of a man who loves his country deeply, but who can see its flaws."
1008,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/foxtrot/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,imdoingmypart,"Jun 4, 2018",9,"We have seen films about grief before; the basic subject matter is nothing new. In fact, the ideas of military allegiance and its affects on family left behind are starting to feel rather familiar. Many viewers, including myself, fear a film that will waste its time on worn out ideas. Make no mistake: Foxtrot is not a worn out film.

Foxtrot follows a family, mainly a husband and wife, in Israel who have just received news of their son's death in military conflict. Neither parent can handle the news as the mother passes out and the father emotionally implodes. Military personnel are accommodating and professional but, most importantly, cold and distant. No one can blame them since they are simply doing their jobs and do not relate to the hopelessness that their former coworker's family is now experiencing. From there the story further unravels, and we learn about the cause-and-effect nature of life's events and how simple choices can both create beauty and also destroy everything that a person has in life. Through such events, the film does not offer much judgment but rather lets the characters' lives play their course.

The marvel of Foxtrot is partially in its creative shots and unpredictable story, as well as its moments of unexpected hilarity, but, most importantly, in the unspoken dialogue between characters. Many films feel the need to fill space with dialogue, which can unfortunately clutter the soundscape and cause the audience to drift further and further away from the characters to whom they are supposed to relate. Foxtrot takes a much more simple approach and allows the viewer to see the characters for who they are without having to be told every detail. We learn more from the characters' expressions and physical emotions than we could ever learn from a scripted conversation. That is not to say that the dialogue in Foxtrot is unimportant; on the contrary, the dialogue only carries weight because it is used so delicately. The film can be both loud and quiet, often in juxtaposing scenes, and each dynamic complements the other more and more as the story engulfs the viewer.

This film is incomplete until the final scene, which made me realize that I have not seen such a sophisticated jigsaw puzzle of a film in some time. Too many films finish in the second act and simply meander on screen for a completely unnecessary finale. Foxtrot spends each minute sparingly, though this fact may not be apparent to the audience until the conclusion. All of the emotions, decisions, and questions fit together in a gloriously small yet powerful finale, but only those patient enough to let Foxtrot work its magic will earn one of the most rewarding film experiences of 2018 so far."

It largely succeeds, but I was not that engaged while watching it nor did I think about it that much afterwards. I felt no real empathy with any of the characters. The main message is that we are all caught up in fate, life is not necessarily fair, and we have to decide how we manage to live with that reality. A worthy message and effort, just not so rewarding to watch."

Warwick Thornton, de Australia, presentó su tercer film en la Biennale y en el TIFF 2017 en donde recibió la bendición de la critica profesional.
Sweet Country es una aventura dolorosa cuyo paisaje demuestra la talentosa #fotografía de Thornton que retrata no solo la belleza y la quietud de un lugar salvaje, si no también, la ausencia de humanidad gracias a la falta de justicia y, aún así, su sensibilidad. I don't want to discredit the movie, which is beautiful, but it doesn't controls well the quantity of tension that it want.
Sam Kelly y su familia son abusados por los ciudadanos de un condado muy retirado en los años 20 de Australia y los actos ebrios de uno de ellos provoca que Sam sea culpado de asesinato. Esto provocará que la familia se vea perseguida y juzgada bajo términos nada imparciales.
Mientras la historia defiende la justicia que Sam busca al huir del juicio, también tiene el ingenio de juzgar a la justicia misma. El elenco hace un trabajo justo para representar sus papeles y logra generar la tensión que busca la historia, pero, sin querer desacreditar a la película, pues es hermosa, esta no mide bien la cantidad de tensión que quiere y, como tampoco busca complacer al público, usa el silencio como voz principal para expresar un discurso de agonía, opresión, trauma, ignorancia y angustia. Por lo tanto los personajes ahogan el razonamiento con decisiones impulsivas cuyas consecuencias se basan en el estatus social de la época.
Sweet Country es una historia que hace justicia a ese mismo valor. Crea una pesada tensión por su valor enorme que hará al público crítico feliz de su misma completud y al público en general cargar con una culpa que preferirán ignorar.

Warwick Thorton, from Australia, presented his third film in the 2017 Biennale and TIFF, where received the blessing from the professional critique.
Sweet Country is a painful adventure which landscape shows the talented photography of Thorton that shows not just the beauty and the quietness of a salvage place, but also, the absence of humanity thanks to the lack of justice and yet, how sensible it is.
Sam Kelly and his family are abused by the citizens of a far away county in the '20s of Australia and the drunk acts of one of them makes Sam to be blamed for an assassination. Then, the family will be persecuted and judged under impartial terms.
While the story defends the justice that Sam searches by running away his trial, it also has the cleverness to judge the justice itself. The cast makes a fair job to represent their roles and they achieve to create the tension the story searches, but, and I don't want to discredit the movie, which is beautiful, it doesn't controls well the amount of tension they want and, as it doesn't want to please the audience, uses the silence as the principal voice to express a speech of agony, oppression, trauma, ignorance and anguish. Therefor, the characters drown the reasoning with impulsive decisions which consequences are based in the social status of that epoch.
Sweet Country is a story that makes justice to that same value. It creates a heavy tension given to its high value that will make the critical public happy by its own fullness and the general public to burden a guilt that would prefer to ignore."

Sweet Country is a visually stunning film. The cinematography in this movie is similar to Mudbound's, but it's even more beautiful! Actually, it has the best cinematography of the year, so far! And while the movie looks poetic, the same goes for the storytelling. It reminded me of Days of Heaven. As a matter of fact, you may feel if you're watching a Terrence Malick film, except it's more fast-paced. The similarity between Sweet Country and Malick's movies don't stop there. As Warwick Thornton used symbolism in Sweet Country in a way that resembles Malick's use of symbolism. By that I mean the use of allegories and symbols in a beautiful way that feels literary or poetic. Unfortunately, the use of symbols in Sweet Country often feels superfluous, and completely unnecessary. Sweet Country is masterly edited, and I think that what makes it very watchable, and often enjoyable despite its poetic style that may indispose some people.

Thornton used intercut flash-forwards and flashbacks heavily. And while sometimes they help us understanding some events that happened, or will happen, therefore build tension, they often seem like nothing but artistic frippery, specially when they are used to make the movie seem if it has a non-linear storytelling. Sweet Country also should be praised for its non-sentimental approach to its message. Unlike other movies that tackle the same subject matter, Sweet Country doesn't dramatize any aspect of its story. The movie even doesn't have a soundtrack, and that makes it feel more realistic. The movie relies on its bleak and dreary atmosphere to imply its subject matter and moral instead of presenting them in the usual manner. All the performances are good. Hamilton Morris' performance is impressive because it feels genuine. Sam Neill is also very good even if his character, Fred Smith, is underdeveloped. Fred Smith is a very important character and should have been more developed, but unfortunately, it's a very flat character.

In general, the movie has some issues in terms of its characters. The movie has too many characters for its own good. And the movie tries to give almost every character its fair share of importance. In the end, Sweet Country a movie of visuals first and foremost, it could hardly be more visually impressive. But, to be honest, it's a very pretentious work. (7/10)"

Leave No Trace is a fairly mature film and without any objection, you manage to understand the problems these characters are going through. Thomasin McKenzie today has established herself as a great actress on the rise, but this 2018 film shows that her great work is reinforced from her first performances. The script and the direction demonstrate a great ability to show a point of view of these people with interests so intrinsic that they expand your way of seeing life.

Sin Rastro es una película bastante madura y sin ninguna objeción, logras entender los problemas por los cuales atraviesan estos personajes.

I find the plot interesting - the concept of people genuinely living out 'in the wild' so to speak. I thought it was quite an atmospheric watch and while the plot pace is quite slow and there's not a great amount of dialogue, I found it quite thought provoking, mainly in terms of it making me question how society rely on people living by their rules, or being judged harshly if not.

I could imagine what the father and daughter were thinking, at times in which their not speaking but clearly expressing themselves by way of body language. They are clearly very thoughtful people. I tried to imagine myself in their shoes, to think how I might regard modern society as someone previously living in the outskirts of it. Its a thinking persons film, I reckon. Not everyone will enjoy it, it might bore some, given there's no action scenes, no car chases etc. but as a character driven drama with some interesting themes (identity, privacy etc.), it was an intriguing and thoughtful watch. I also particularly liked the use of music in the background to add to the atmosphere in certain scenes - I imagine this would be worth seeing in a cinema if possible, for it does have a sort of mildly claustrophobic feel to it at times. Its one of those films which may well have you changing your mind about your opinions on the characters at different times in the plot but suffice to say things aren't entirely clear cut. There is also  certain poignancy present. In any case, I didn't find it a boring film - I found it somewhat moving, if anything."

I would have appreciated a little more information about the man and how things got to be this way for the two of them - there are hints, but we are left to speculate.

-""We can still think our own thoughts.""

The first movie that came to my mind after watching the opening scene from this movie is Captain Fantastic. While both movies share similar themes as they can be classified under the Survival Movies sub-genre, Leave No Trace is a completely different film. What makes this movie different and special is what it implies not what it shows at all. Like Rebel Without a Cause, this movie demands from the viewers to put themselves in the main characters' shoes. Without doing so, you'll not be able to relate or feel anything, and the movie would feel very bland and cold for you. Because this movie in particular stands out from the other movies of its kind due to
its non-dramatized approach to its subject matter. It feels so authentic and realistic, and that's exactly what some people find somewhat off-putting. But that wasn't, by any means, the case for me. I found this movie so moving, and I related to the characters so much.

Without Debra Granik's nuanced and delicate direction this movie could have been stiff and boring. But Debra Granik added some small, yet very effective, touches to emphasize on some sweet memories, and therefore make them stuck in our heads, and, before everything, in our hearts to evoke a catharsis in the audience by the end of the movie.

Both Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie delivered brilliant performances that feel as authentic as Debra Granik's serene direction. The result is a movie that massively succeeded to be heart-breaking without the slightest reliance on dramatic clichés such as the highs and lows we often see in this kind of movies.

All that being said, halfway through the movie, there was a slight tendency to continue the story in a formulaic way. Fortunately, that didn't happen. But that doesn't mean that I found the first, and especially the first, and the third act more cohesive, and more original as well. With more deviling into Ben Foster's character, Will, the second act could have been not only less flawed, but also potentially the strongest among the other two acts. With these problems, I found that I understood Will state of mind more than I felt it. That said, as the movie progresses I became more and more invested in his character, hence more emotionally connected to it.

What really impressed me is Thomasin McKenzie's performance. Her character, Tom, is incredibly compelling and complex, and the way we get to know her characteristics from is absolutely genius! Just from the dialogue and the naturalistic way Thomasin McKenzie responds in every single situation we know that Tom is grateful, caring, honest and very frank, and afraid of change like her father, but also has an entirely different reason for being so.

Leave No Trace is, first and foremost, a deeply moving humanistic tale thanks to its unconventional and unpredictable approach to its subject matter, and the honest and authentic performances from the underrated Ben Foster, and especially from the massively talented young actress Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie.

Leave No Trace

Granik's version of the book, ""The Abandonment"" written by Peter Rock, has the finiteness that makes you sink in its abyss. The finite number of characters, the finite amount of segments and its that repetitiveness that weaves out a poem that requires spatial of a larger margin, hence what she does in here is, tugs out all the mechanics for it to float freely without any strings tied. This father and daughter exploration is cathartic to the core and communicates neatly, not for its positive emotions but the negative, that it doesn't flinch to project. Since, if Foster has all the tactics to survive that he teaches to Mackenzie, he also has plethora of emotional burden of his forsaken and untouched past and that is not something which is supposed to be passed upon. It tells an honest tale of Foster and Mackenzie and their journey across the woods where the zeal to live by nature, costs each other unfeasible terms. No matter how artificial it gets at times, the touch of nature is imputed in each frame. And Granik does it by keeping both her lead character together even when they are separated; either their notions can be filtered out or their vocab. The characters in here doesn't need the element of surprise to scare, its their looks, their habits, their stillness, that leaves us shook. The primary reason why we are afraid of these simple characters, is because we start to care for them; if someone gets wounded, he or she will be taken care of with a first aid kit. There is very little skin in the telltale, it wants you to **** off and feel the blood and sweat of the game; these chess pieces are real. Foster hesitates to look Mackenzie in the eye while she gazes deep into his, this is a performance of life for both of the actors screaming through the entire feature. If those buzzing of the bees weren't loud enough for you, listen to it again, Granik has a story to tell you. She is not here to convince you to look closely and listen carefully, she demands it with her apt finesse on executing such a behemoth concept. Mackenzie's character is bred out of raw woods, hence her nature is to reside and breathe in the current moment, she is ready to take what's hers if be needed, she will earn for it and she will take it. On the other hand, Foster is chiseled with experience and lives in the past, which allows him to spend the entire breathe of his on preparing the trajectory of the future. Combining these two, the makers leave them around greenery (it is beautifully shot and has supremely appealing bright colors that grabs your attention since the beginning) and observes the retaliation that their chemistry spreads. This is a work of nothing but sheer passion that ought to fuel such a fragile concept and Leave No Trace will leave no opportunity whatsoever to heal your wounds."

1042,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/leave-no-trace/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Bertaut1,"Aug 12, 2018",7,"Deeply respectful of its subject

In Walden, his 1854 memoir/philosophical treatise, Henry David Thoreau chronicles a period of two years, two months, and two days during which time he lived alone in a small cabin he himself had built in the forest near Walden Pond, Massachusetts, on property owned by his mentor and friend, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Inspired by the tenets of transcendentalism, of especial importance to Thoreau was ""Self-Reliance"", an 1841 essay by Emerson, which argues that an individual must avoid conformity, follow their own ideas and concepts, and trust in their own instincts if they are to attain a deeper understanding of the nature of existence. In Walden, Thoreau was putting this concept to the test, isolating himself from civil society, and existing in nature with only the barest means of subsistence (""I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach"").

Walden went on to become one of the (many) foundational texts of libertarianism, the core principles of which are the valuation of personal liberty above all else and the encouragement of scepticism towards authority in general, and the state/government in particular.

All of which brings us to Leave no Trace, which could, perhaps, be described as a darker version of Captain Fantastic (2016). Directed by Debra Granik, and written for the screen by Granik and Anne Rosellini, based on Peter Rock's 2010 novel My Abandonment, the film tells the story of Will (Ben Foster), a veteran suffering from PTSD, who is living off the grid with his daughter Tom (Thomasin McKenzie). Making their home in a national park in Portland, Oregon, they embody many of the concepts underpinning Emerson's notions of self-reliance; individual authority, nonconformity, solitude, internal self-truth, with Will especially valuing freedom of thought. However, when a jogger sees Tom, park wardens are dispatched to track them down, and social services open an investigation into their situation.

None of the philosophical theories outlined above are explicitly mentioned anywhere in the film. However, knowledge of them definitely helps one to more easily understand Will. Whether Granik or Rosellini are even aware of these concepts is beside the point, as they serve to give one a more assured theoretical entry point into a not easily penetrated film. For example, does one have to know that Will is at stage six of Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development to understand or enjoy the film? No, of course not. Does it help? Absolutely.

On a less theoretical note, the film does a lot that on paper would seem to be wrong; for long stretches of time, there is no real sense of any kind of standard Aristotelian conflict, as we simply observe Will and Tom going about their day. In tandem with this, the film is extremely light on plot, incident, and tangible character development, focusing instead on mood and tone, and calling upon the actors to externalise their emotions through action and expression rather than dialogue. Obviously, this means almost everything hinges on the quality of the performances and the believability of the bond between the characters. Thankfully, both Foster and McKenzie are exceptional – he plays Will as someone who has seen the darker side of humanity and has no time for frivolousness, whereas she plays Tom as someone desperate to have a childhood, but who also wants to make her father proud. In one particularly telling scene, when they must leave on a moment's notice, he tells her to pack only what is essential, and she places a toy horse in her backpack, but only after she has wrapped it up so Will can't see it, an action which tells us a great deal about both characters.

The film's pacing is both its greatest asset, and its biggest flaw. To speed things up would have compromised the tone Granik is going for. However, this kind of methodical pacing is likely to alienate a lot of viewers, who will undoubtedly criticise the film as boring, and its focus on Will and Tom to the exclusion of almost everything else as too narrow. When it does branch out (for example, a minor sub-theme is the treatment of veterans upon their return to society), it is only insofar as to show how the two main characters are affected. What's especially interesting about the story, however, is that the narrative seems predicated on the transcendentalist notion of the inherent goodness of people; pretty much everyone Will and Tom encounter is trying to do right by them, even the social workers are genuinely trying to help them. In the end, what the film gives us is a deeply respectful portraiture of a man trying to make the best of it in the only way he knows how."
1043,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/leave-no-trace/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GrantD243,"Jul 27, 2018",9,"Leave No Trace follows a dad, who is ex-military, and his teenage daughter who live in a public park. They live in this park by choice, not necessarily out of necessity. They have a solid camp set up, a daily routine, and while the daughter doesn't go to public school her dad has homeschooled her very well. They aren't completely isolated, either, as they go into the city whenever they need to. But, one day a jogger sees the daughter while running down the trail, alerts the authorities, and they are scooped up and taken to a government agency. Eventually, they are let go and attempt to adjust to their new way of life in an actual house. That's as far as I'll go with story details, because that is where the story really begins. The story of Leave No Trace is not an exciting one. This is a pure drama and the true focus here is on the characters. We watch Will (the dad) attempt to adjust to living as a ""normal"" person in a house with a day job, while also battling his memories of war which often haunt him in the night. Living outside is all Tom (his daughter) has really ever known, so we also see how she adjusts and what she thinks about the average way of living in the U.S. Their struggle, and sometimes their inability, to adapt is what drives the story. This is a very emotional film as well. And by that I don't mean that it'll make you cry or tear up, but the emotion is so strong that it is almost a character itself. I was at full attention the entire time while watching this one. Everything just comes together in a way that easily makes this one of my favorite films of the year.

Characters: The real reason why this film succeeds so well in what its trying to do is because of the characters and the actors playing them. Ben Foster puts in what I would call an Oscar-worthy performance as Will. We sympathize with him, we see the conflict within him, but we also question him at times because of how set in his ways he is. Thomasin McKenzie also puts in a tremendous performance as Tom. As far as I can tell, she hasn't had many major roles but she is incredibly impressive with her ability to carry scenes here. She's also very strong in the more emotional scenes. Cinematography: There are some great shots in here, but the real reason why I wanted to note the cinematography is because there is a use of symetry at the beginning and end of the story that really impressed me. It was such a simple addition, but it really helped bring everything together. Also, I loved that the director chose to use music so sparingly. There are some scenes where there is absolutely no music at all, only the sounds of the environment and dialogue of the characters. Overall: Leave No Trace is a terrific movie that very well could end up getting an Oscar nomination or two at the end of the year. The strong performances and the gripping story really make it worth the trip to the theater."

Tom and her father have been living in the woods of Forest Park completely undetected for a couple of years. Her mother had died when Tom was young and her father suffers PTSD and we follow what happens when they are ‘discovered’ and brought into the world of community. There is a strong love between daughter and father and though she finds sharing life with others is giving something a growing teenager needs she does not want to be separated from her Dad.
Tom is way ahead scholastically due to the teaching by her father but meeting bunnies, dogs even bees along with discovering what the 4H is, learning how to ride a bike and meets a friendly boy, giving her a taste what she may have missed not knowing she was missing it.
There is no high drama regarding Will’s illness, no question if the two are homeless or just not living as most people do, just a quiet look at how people can take your heart and, sometimes, that is not enough.
“Leave No Trace” is a linear story that, in a sense, has an open ending but you have come to know these two people to the point that you almost know what will happen to them in the future—with some doubt.
Though it may not be a ‘must see’ it certainly is a way to escape the South Florida heat and humidity for an hour and fifty minutes and watching Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie give a star making turn is certainly worth your time."
1045,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/leave-no-trace/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Dufreshest,"Jul 22, 2018",9,"Leave No Trace is a film inspired by the book My Abandonment written by Peter Rock. Obviously, there are many discrepancies between films inspired by the stories in books and the actual stories in the books. As much as the story and film differ, I find Leave No Trace radically adjusts the narrative to direct and instruct more so than fulfill the telling of the story written by Peter Rock. My Abandonment feels like more of a **** process similar to Helen MacDonald’s H is for Hawk which carries a poetic resonance of Annie Dillard’s Holy the Firm though is less agonizing and grueling than the latter two mentioned.

Leave No Trace utilizes the “The Principles of Leave No Trace” in action to fulfill a core element of the story branching from My Abandonment which concerns leaving as is and letting go. There is a full redemption in the film and a freeing relinquishing that does not exist in My Abandonment. There are more than a few concepts at play in Leave No Trace — some more apparent than others — that must be addressed in accordance with the text of its inspiration.

There are very awkward still moments in the film that indicate an awkward attachment between the father and daughter which makes more sense in connection with the book focusing on Caroline’s (Tom/Yellow in the film) relationship with her father. Adoptive families and families from which adoptees come from are important topics which find a spin throughout the film which makes Will (Tom/Yellow’s father in the film) look more like a person assisting with and disrupting home placement at the same time (which ends up making the film more about a father-daughter relationship than a film about adoption processes).

Will becomes a more understanding parent by action as the film progresses and stands as a guiding force which gives Tom/Yellow the tools necessary to break away into her own. Tom/Yellow begins delineating the circumstances of which she wants to live with which is very important in viewing. Tom and Will spend a lot of time staring at each other conversing: both of them seem to be slowly separating especially as Tom begins to find that living with her father’s way of life is not most suitable to her liking. Leave No Trace makes choice very available for women — growing women in particular — that struggle breaking away from their fatherly nurturing to discover a broader world of choices available to them. In the film, Tom/Yellow is a woman of sensible grounding that has undergone proper training from her father on ways to survive and is capable of assessing social situations about her well enough to progress without suffering overwhelmingly due to her upbringing though she does go through slight troubles poetically shown through her interactions with her father in the film.

The other aspect is that lives are different regardless of the family from which one comes. There might be a familial purpose to assist growth — but, that will never be able to undermine an individual’s need — even want — to develop their life, within their own life, of their own circumstances. The film shows a great understanding from Tom/Yellow which results in a peaceable separation between Will and Tom. The book, My Abandonment, showcases a much rougher separation between Caroline (Tom/Yellow) and her father. Also, the effects of the daughter-father relationship extremely affect Caroline’s developments as an individual breaking into a more public-social realm: the daughter’s reality is completely twisted because of her relationship with her father and prevents her from even accepting the assistance of non-judgmental women willing to help her.

Both the film and the book create an accepting and overcoming on the daughter’s part of the father’s circumstances as well as of developing familial circumstances as the daughter in both the book and the film progress on their own with their available mind and skill sets. I understand the importance of parenting in one’s life — more so than parenting — guidance. People need guidance depending on their experiential, knowledge, and understanding levels which varies from person to person. I like the patience shown in the film which indicates a slow process might be necessary and best moving forward in one’s life where as in the text the daughter continues on her path though eventually finds her own pacing within the pacing she has come to learn from her father. There are a lot of good relationships that are available and to be had that should not find disruption due to one’s behavioral habits and understandings that may be detrimental to personal growths. A mind capable of truly developing and understanding does not suffer from having to experience familiarity and is capable of a flexibility which allows for the creation of life without bounds across many, if not all, mediums of existence. Overall: B+/A-

Their relationship is tried when they're pressed into living in a more traditional environment. Director Debra Granik (""Winter's Bone"") has created an underplayed examination of their relationship with sensitive beauty beauty. There are no big emotions or big calamities, just a compelling journey with a quiet intensity and memorable performances."

The people who live in the woods have all the traditional American virtues – fiercely independent, smart, hard-working, loyal, and kind-hearted. The film is also beautiful looking and beautifully paced. The acting is superb and completely believable. America also looks gorgeous. Debra Granik is a great director, and the actors are completely believable, especially Ben Foster and Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie."

It's a story about an army vet with PTSD who lives in the woods with his teenage daughter. They are hiding from people because he seems not to be able to live among them. He tries his best to provide for his daughter teaching her survival skills, homeschooling her, etc. They are very close, there is no need for lengthy dialogs. His daughter's mom is not in the picture, the girl practically does not remember her. She is all he's got in this life yet at some point the girl insists that she wants to live among people.
There are no villains in this movie, no violence; people do what they think they should. Yet it is so dramatic, raw and emotional...
All aspects of movie making are fantastic: performances, script, cinematography, realism. Every little detail is crisp and believable.

Brilliant movie, the best this year so far. Definitely Oscar material in many categories."

Been Foster and Thomasin McKenzie are so endearing together and really seem to form a genuine connection in every scene they share together. Like their traveling characters in the film however, the story felt rather all over the place at times and the ending was a slight letdown for me, but overall, Foster and McKenzie's onscreen chemistry and performances are the beating heart of this often rather touching film with lots of realistic and poignant themes to boot."

The film's superb performances and beautiful cinematography lend much to an engaging story that undoubtedly captures the smoldering sentiments many of us feel but don't have the courage to act upon. A little tightening up in the editing and a better fleshed-out back story would have helped make this a truly great film, though, as it stands now, it's certainly one of 2018's better offerings."

While the story isn't new, it tells it in such an emotionally relevant way it's impossible to ignore. Hell Or High water is a character-driven movie, with characters so interesting you find yourself inside their head. Each bank heist scene is intense and so realistic it feels real, and the characters are so realistic you feel they are in danger. Another thing that makes the characters so great is that they aren't invincible. They get hurt, which makes the tense scenes all the tenser. What also makes the characters so great is that they aren't perfect. They have problems that make them all the more relatable. The only problem I can find is that the movie can be a little uneven. It can quickly go from super intense to slow-burn very quickly. But nonetheless, Hell Or High water is a film you will love if you have good taste and love cinema."

1063,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hell-or-high-water/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TheRaggedFlygon,"Jan 26, 2020",8,"Hell or High Water appears as another standard ""rob the bank"" movie while a policeman hunts them down, but as the movie progresses, you begin to see it as much more than that. Each of the three main actors give amazing performances. Ben Foster is the hardened criminal who is in this because it is fun and couldn't care less what happens to those who oppose him. Chris Pine is the brains of the operation who has, for the most parts, good intentions and just wants to get the job done. Jeff Bridges is a cop who is near retirement who is searching for one last catch to end his career. All three of these actors are absolutely fantastic and they carry this film.

What this film gains in its character, it lacks in its plot. Its plot is quite simple, lacks few twists or turns, and ends just about exactly how you expect. The characters and dialogue are why you watch this film, not because its plot will keep you enticed throughout. That being said, this film does make a very interesting statement about capitalism by drawing comparisons between modern capitalistic practices and the mistreatment of American Indians. That, for me, was the most interesting part of this film plot-wise. The main storyline is still a bit lacking in terms of thrills, but it does succeed in clearly outlining its central theme.

Overall, Hell or High Water is unlikely to be remembered by me as one of the greatest films of all time, it feels very similar to other movies that I have seen, however what it is is one of the greatest films of 2016 that contains some of Pine, Foster, and Bridges' best performances to date and for that reason, it is worth a watch."

The revenge on the people harming your relatives by hurting the guilty ones shows always a good taste in film materials - strong and inspiring.

So I guess.. just be always there for all of your favorite people, relatives ones and so one. But this is just really small detail and I'm a virgo, so that explains it all. Great cinematography. No doubt. Clearly, in the last years, there has been some big progress in film shooting, film industry.  And that has set the bar a lot higher.

Watching good people do bad things for the right reasons isn't exactly anything new, so the strength of the movie doesn't come from originality. Instead Hell or High Water succeeds just because of how well made it is. The cinematography is gorgeous and the movie has a fitting soundtrack to go along with it's delightfully true-to-form depiction of the Texas lifestyle. David Mackenzie pulls incredible performances from what we know to be already highly talented actors. This is genuinely some of the best work of each cast member's careers.

The story itself is brimming with emotion and believable human interactions. The dialog is clever and often quite funny. The plot itself is familiar, but no less remarkable due to it's cleverness, thrills, and ability to pull the audience in. It grabs your heart and connects you to the characters. No matter which side of the law they are on.

Compelling drama, heart, soul, and the absurdity of Texas all come together in the careful hands of a talented director and fantastic to create something wonderful. Highly recommended."

Almost every shot in this movie was visually pleasing. And even more important, the script managed to ""flesh-out"" almost all the characters we came in contact with. Every scene managed to move the story forward without giving you the ""reveal"" toO early. The reveal was their motivations. A serious film which at times would show some comedic levity while showing you real characters; not what some would like to see as characters."

Pero con el tiempo y sumando que escuché hablar sobre ella a gente con un gusto parecido al mio de manera más que positiva, me lanzé a verla. Y la verdad, me parece la mejor película del año y mi favorita. Me encantó.

La película cuenta la peculiar relación entre dos hermanos y paralelamente la de dos policías, uno a punto de retirarse, que persiguen a los hermanos que roban bancos. Es la típica fórmula, sí, pero la grandeza está en sus diálogos y la relación que se establece entre sus personajes, unido a un toquecito de western crepuscular. Es magnífica.

I wanted to get that out of the way because I have a serious complaint about this film. Hell or High Water spends most of its time in a realistic place. It paints a picture of two brothers who have a realistic life with believable relationships with both each other and the world around them. It also paints a realistic scenario that, while not without holes, certainly gives a purpose behind the bank robbing and other shenanigans. Hell and High Water is also a fable. Not quite of the Magic Realism kind that one easily could have seen this film drift into but of the wish fulfillment kind. The kind one would expect in a children's adventure. In other words the ending of The Goonies. Now one could easily argue if The Goonies ending worked for well The Goonies but it simply doesn’t strike true to a film that admittedly was getting looser with reality as it went along. Upon reflection one certainly, could imagine that the writer or director was well aware that they were drifting into fable territory and simply loosened the rules of the world of the film as events progressed. I certainly am willing to give this finely crafted film this. The ending just seemed too clean for a film so otherwise grounded. The equivalent **** pirate ship drifting in the background.

Speaking of endings souring an otherwise fine experience. The inclusion of a blasting Black Sabbath song at the end of the first Iron Man worked because well it's and Iron Man movie and it's an Iron Man song. This film is drifting quietly into the sunset and suddenly we are blasted with this loud obnoxious country rock song (Outlaw State of Mind by Chris Stapleton) that doesn’t fit the scene, or mood and honestly at that point doesn’t fit the film. The film overall is great, The acting is more than solid all across the board and the film spends the vast majority of its running time in a good place. Like I said a very good film overall."

As far as movie goers go, I may be an exception, but I have a complete lack of romanticism with the American West. I understand the merit of older westerns, but nowadays, they tend to just seem dated. But something about Jeff Bridges in a Texas desert seems right. I’m also a **** for a good screenplay and some risky robbery scenes, and right off the bat this film lets you know that is what you are in for. The contrast between the four main characters, the two brothers and two rangers, drive the narrative to a point to where you aren’t sure who you are rooting for by the time the climactic scene begins. So if you like bank robberies, Chris Pine’s eyes, and dramatic scenes of cars being buried, you should check this out. 8.7/10"

We do not see any more of those shoot-em-ups against the “Injuns,” but instead a blurred line between sheriff and outlaw. Yet most noticeable of all, it takes place in the here and now, rather than the turn of America’s economic structure.

Hell or High Water, written by Sicario’s Taylor Sheridan, shows some of those gritty details that breathe life back into the shallow, feel-good classical genre. Here, we see what Texans under the law truly act like: they use a bulldozer to bury their P.O.S. car under dirt to hide any evidence, and they throw their chips in poker to increase their luck, all with the right rationalizations explained about their backstories to help you understand their turmoil. The two black-masked thieves we focus on here, played by the greatly underrated Chris Pine (Into the Woods, Star Trek) and Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma, The Messenger), make a living out of hopping from bank-to-bank as the only means to financially secure themselves. You normally wouldn’t want to care for a couple of crooks like them, but once you learn their background, you’ll understand.

Sheridan’s plot is not a terribly original concept for a modern-day cowboy movie, virtually copying the same tone and concept as the brilliant No Country for Old Men. This Western only sets itself apart from others by its lack of international relationships.

Even so, the hearts of all the men living here will haunt you. Each of them abuses their second amendment rights, even the filthy-rich passerby at the gas station carries firearms at all times. The town by no means chose to side with these crooks, especially not the near-retiring sheriff, played with a compellingly rich voice by Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, Crazy Heart). Despite his wishes, he sets off a cat-and-mouse chase to restore integrity to these disturbers of the peace. Think of it like a Bonnie & Clyde type of thriller, except without the fun, gore, and romance. Or better yet, a Thelma & Louise type of criminal’s sympathy story, except without any strong female characters.

Yeah, hate to break it to you: Westerns today still don’t contain enough girl power like we’d expect from them by now. The female characters are either dead mothers we never meet, moral support for the main characters, or bankers who get harassed by the two crooks. If these otherwise talented actresses were made somehow more active, then greater dimension would have been added to make the script strike closer to home.

Although the widely unnoticed director David Mackenzie deserves recognition for his compelling creation of Texas’ true culture. In his view of the dead south, automobiles display the ultimate sign of one’s wealth, and oil mines can be found in an average man’s backyard. Although everything looks like the everyday mundane life for these inhabitants, several signs still connect Mackenzie’s imagined world with the works of John Ford. A field fire seen in the distance from behind a herd of frightened cattle heightens the highly-saturated look of the picture, and the dusty texture of the art direction reflects the complexion of the men unqualified to protect the people. You even get a new take on the classic showdown between sheriff and outlaw- with a new psychological twist.

Hell or High Water will last as one of those pictures made by men from the old days for men from the old days. Not everyone will come out from the experience satisfied, but for the thinking-type of viewer, Mackenzie’s new take on a familiar concept will knock ‘em out dead."

""Hell or high water"" no será recordado como un gran éxito ni como una película de culto (al menos ahora). Sin embargo dentro de unos años, en un conversación donde salgan películas de este genero, a cada cual mas moderna, llegará un punto que tras nombrar ""No es país para viejos"" la gente se quedará pensando. Entonces alguien dirá; ¿os acordáis de esta película?, estaba realmente bien, me dejó sin poder pensar en otra cosa durante un buen rato. Y se pensará que estaba muy bien dirigida, pero que tampoco tenía nada transcendental.

Es entonces cuando un segundo visionado pondrá a esta película en su lugar. Cuando la vuelvas a ver, recordando ligeramente lo que iba a ocurrir, te darás cuenta de lo trascendental que es. O mejor dicho, de como con algo tan simple, te puede hacer ver tantos detalles. Esa sensación de estar ante algo que no habías visto antes y que te muestra distintos puntos de vista a los que tenías, esa sensación no la tienen ni muchas grandes películas. ""Hell or high water"" no consigue eso en su totalidad como película, lo consigue en algo mas pequeño, algo que se que está ahí y que creo haberlo visto varias veces.

Puede que me equivoque y sea lo contrario. Puede que algún día vuelva a verla porque me he acordado de ella y ya no vea esa calidad, bien porque era superficial, bien porque no había.

From the British director of 'Starred Up' fame, it was like another 'The Place Beyond the Pines'. Feels like a modern western kind, because of where this story takes place, I mean Texas. There's no digital world like phones, computers et cetera, just an old fashioned storytelling. This is the story of two brothers and their series of bank robbery job. They are doing it for a reason, but on the other end, two cops make their effort to find who they are and nab them red handed. So when they meet, that's where the story gets to its end part.

It has a strong opening, then slows down. Actually, it was approached like a classic crime film, which mean no high-tech. The story was a one liner, but the events in that story were extended. A simple screenplay, yet very effective presented on the screen. Of course the story ends with this film, but feels like there's more. It is very unlikely, though I'm thinking of a sequel.

The people will remember this film for Ben Foster and Chris Pine. One of the best duo on the screen. Easily one of the best films of the year, but just it is a different theme and genre. I watched it not knowing the meaning of the title, and then I googled it. It is nothing like a must see, but I believe that you might regret if you miss it or delay your watch. So I suggest you make a right choice.

1112,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/aquarius/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"Nov 4, 2017",7,"Home is where all the memories preserved.

I have to start the review by mentioning the recent year Russian film 'Durak', also known as 'The Fool' in English. In the same year, another similar themed Russian film, 'Leviathan' got nominated for the Oscars. What those both films highlighted were not just the corruptions, but the threats the common people face. Raising voice for good against evil is still a distant for such potential country. Here comes the Brazilian version. This is not on the same level. I meant the intensity of the event, how all folds. Nevertheless, the same core issue in a different continent.

This film met with several controversies. One of them omitted it from the Oscars race. But the film was received well from all the quarters. I did not find any issue. I thought it became unfortunate victim, especially, could be because of the developers and their connection with the corrupt powerful men. It's neither a masterpiece. I just consider it a good film. A message film. But not for everyone. Particularly, it is good for grownups viewing for the reason I'll going mention later.

The story of the 65 year old Clara. Her life has been successful being a music critic. Now a widow, and all her children settled down. It opened on her birthday where all the friends and family gathered to celebrate the occasion. Living alone in a small and beautiful beach view apartment. But the thing is she's the last one who still in that old building. Everyone had left it when the developers decided to demolish it and build a modern one. She's fighting to save the heritage. All her memories lie in there. But the developers have a different plan to force her out, and that's the remaining film to unfold how and other following developments.

❝So when you like it, it's 'vintage'. If you don't like it, it's 'old'. Right?❞

The opening scene was a slight offbeat. Because right away it does not reveal who is the person of the film. Besides, some of the odd scenes in the middle would raise some eyebrows. Those were not actually the full fledged scenes, but glimpses that goes back to like the 70s or something. The idea of those parts were not properly understandable, but I think it is about missing those good times. The lone fighter concept was inspiring. At one point, when everybody around her thought that she's making an unnecessary scene out of it, she was firm on her decision and did what has to be done.

This was one of those films I did not like it on the spot. But slowly captivated. Once it's focus was fixed on one particular character, the rest of the tale set forward on what it wanted to tell us. As I understood it, it was not exactly about corruption, except a part of it was. It was the fight for ones right. A fight to save the past. On the other hand, the people from her opposite are ready to take extreme steps to defeat her. That's where it gets into the controversy. The controversy of those stupid tricks used to achieve the goal. This kind of a film coming from Brasil is really wonderful to educate poor knowledge people who easily become victims in a similar fashion.

It was a French-Brasil collaboration film. I'm reviewing it after a couple of days of my watch. Because I wanted to think about it for a while, scene by scene. The more I recall, the more I'm starting to like it. So I advise same to you as well that don't come to any conclusion just after you have watched. Because it could not be what you have heard about it. My only issue was the runtime. The 150 minutes were a too long. But manageable if you watch regularly, such slow films.

Well written, directed and acted. Even the location was ideal. But they could have avoided the those sex scenes which I earlier labelled them as odd scenes. There were too many, even camera pans out from somewhere far away in the bush. Kind of unrelated. I am not against such an idea, as human daily life filled with those. But when the theme was seriously pivoting on a serious issue, these came as distraction. Why I'm pointing out that strongly is that a fine film like this should be for all ages, even for teenagers. It missed that opportunity. Otherwise and still a nice drama film to recommend the adults.

And dramas usually portrays either violence at the favelas or some sad, also violent story, taking place at a very poor part of our northeast area.

""Aquarius"" throws away all these cliches and it's just a great movie, period. Not a great Brazilian movie, but a great universal movie, telling a very compelling story about our society as a whole, with all its characteristics and, mostly, its flaws.

There are tons of themes in this film and that's my favourite thing about it. These are themes of revenge, war, responsibility and community, among many others. What I don't like about it is that there are many stupid character decisions, which the movie is conscious about, but it was still frustrating. I always try to look for reason behind the villains' actions, but Killmonger was so full of rage, there wasn't much reasoning needed. The protagonists are likeable, my favourite character is Shuri. I also loved Agent Ross's arc.

The direction is great, the visual effects are stunning, the cinematography is amazing. I loved the longshots and the spinning ones, the fight scenes looked great too. The score is unique, but not my style. I love Ludwig Göransson, but this is definitely my favourite of his. The cast is great, Chadwick Boseman (Rest In Peace) is great as the protagonist, I loved to see Winston Duke, Daniel Kaluuya and Lupita Nyong'o too.

Only fleetingly referencing the preceding (and forthcoming) films in Marvel's repertoire, Black Panther is a largely self-contained, by-the-numbers superhero flick. Which works both for it and against it. In one respect, that enables the entire cast to establish themselves. Safe from the need to constantly pay homage to Tony Stark or Thanos, Panther's supporting players thrive and King T'Challa himself goes through a complete character arc. On the other hand, it often feels like we've been here before. Maybe not specifically, as the film goes to great lengths to set up Wakanda as a unique culture with authentic customs, but certainly thematically.

As a ""back to basics"" approach with well-timed, socially conscious values, it functions very well. Its flavor is like nothing else we've seen from Marvel so far - a bright, optimistic blend of tech and nature that really works - and the wide diversity of the on-screen population is both effective and appropriate. A complete, enjoyable new entry in the publisher's stacked catalog of characters, and a short breath of fresh air, if not a complete breakthrough."

It has a good cast, an interesting story with a relatable moral dilemma and a strong villain that could be a great hero if things were different. After a flashback to the past the story deals with T’Challa becoming the next king of Wakanda. This is not granted as he has to fulfill a ceremony and not all groups / tribes in Wakanda are satisfied with the status quo. As sidenote: Wakanda is pretending to be an average African country but in truth they are far technological superior than anyone else and this is because of their Vibranium metal (Fictional metal with amazing properties far stronger than titanium). Meanwhile a strange soldier named Killmonger has a plan that can change everything. I am sorry to be vague here to avoid spoilers. The story is amazing. It deals with sins of the past, what makes a leader and responsibilities. Also the villain is really strong. His motives are understandable, he is intimidating and awesome. Like I said he could be a great hero if his past was different. For the actors we got a strong cast. Chadwick Boseman is the perfect choice for T’Challa. Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger is equally good and a favorite choice after Thanos for best MCU villain. I think I shorten it a bit a praise the whole cast and team behind the screen as it is well earned. The costumes, set and special effects were excellent too. Overall I think the praise is deserved and I also give a 10/10.

1149,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/black-panther/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,pur__0_0__,"Jun 17, 2021",8,"So before the release of Avengers: Infinity War, I had never watched any of the MCU movies before. It was only after the release of that movie that I saw everyone talking about it all the time, and that I had to watch all the movies before I could start watching IW. I had to watch all the movies so that I could catch up in time before Endgame. I had heard a little bit about some random guy named Black Panther getting snapped out by Thanos, but I really didn't care because I had never even heard about this guy my whole life. So after all the movies I had watched, Black Panther was next. I wasn't really interested in seeing this movie because it seemed so much culturally different, but I thought that if I had watched Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man without having known anything about them before, so I can do the same here also.

The first thing that strikes differently about this movie is that this is not exactly a character origin story. Black Panther was already previously introduced in Captain America: Civil War where his father had died, but he was never explained as to why or how he's the superhero. This is the movie which finally explains that part. The world thinks Wakanda is a poor country while in reality it is a powerhouse of vibranium. T'Challa is a leader and the saviour of the people. The king of Wakanda gets to be the Black Panther, for which they have to take the heart shaped herb that helps them acquire knowledge from all the previous Black Panthers.

Other than the superhero himself, N'Jadaka ie Killmonger believes he is the rightful ruler of the kingdom, because of which he challenges T'Challa. From Killmonger's point of view he should be the king because he wants to take revenge fromT'Challa's father T'Chaka for killing his father. The movie spends a good deal over it, such that it allows the viewer to sympathise with him, even though his actions are clearly wrong. Finally N'Jadaka beats T'Challa in the ceremonial fight which allows him to be the Black Panther instead. There are multiple moral dilemmas faced by the protagonists, as to whether let their kingdom be governed by someone who lets his emotions get the better of him or dare to overthrow their own king.

The moral dilemma is actually a very important point in the story, since in the scene where T'Challa, Shuri and Okoye are talking about this, Okoye says it's her duty to serve whoever sits on the throne no matter how the person is. That is a stark contrast from both T'Challa and N'Jadaka, since both of them see beyond their rules to see whom and what to fight for. The Wolf Tribe led by M'Baku is ready to help Black Panther, in spite of having previously faced a humiliating defeat by T'Challa in the Black Panther ceremony. While T'Challa makes allies along the way, N'Jadaka eliminates his allies.

Although the CGI was a bit off in some places, overall it was good. Since I had no idea what I was heading for, I didn't expect to see a Wakanda having such a high technology (I didn't watch any trailer before watching the movie or read any comics). The fight scenes were also pretty fun to watch, except for the Busan one. I didn't like it for some reason which I myself don't know. The acting was also very good. This movie absolutely deserved the Oscar for the costume design. I think it has the best interpretation of the suit as depticted in the comics (only Iron Man comes a close second since it's not as comicbook accurate).

Although this movie is not one of my favourites, it did leave some huge impacts on me. First of all, I have purchased almost all Black Panther comics. Secondly I have become a lot more open to watching movies from Africa, since now I won't be afraid of not understanding anything. And thirdly, it's something I will always remember Chadwick Boseman for. Rest in peace hero, you did a pretty great job."

Funnily enough, everyone says this is the first black marvel superhero movie, which my cousin of all people pointed down. Saying the first one was actually Blade, and I found that very interesting. I wonder if the reason not more people pointed that out like he did is because Blade may have failed to resonate with a wider audience like Black Panther did, and so people assume Black Panther has been the first.

Be that as it may, I'll keep this brief. The story, characters, art direction and soundtrack are pretty good! I thought the cheesy jokes may have done the movie a disservice and the movie at large failed to engage me all that much tbh. I like it for what it is regardless."

'Black Panther', the 18th MCU film, is very good. I really like the world building of Wakanda, as well as the cinematography and costume design. The cast are, as expected, excellent as well.

Chadwick Boseman is terrific as T'Challa, as I knew he would be based on the glimpse we see of him in 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War'. He is the best actor here, but Danai Gurira runs him close. I'm a huge fan of Gurira's due to her performances in 'The Walking Dead' so knew I'd rate her here too, she's fun to watch - it's cool to see her weapon-wielding once again.

Elsewhere, Lupita Nyong'o is good and so is Letitia Wright; she's great in 2015's 'Urban Hymn', which I had seen her in previously. It's a fairly stacked cast, with the likes of Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis, Daniel Kaluuya and Michael B. Jordan also appearing; Jordan's character isn't the best, but he himself is more than solid."

Really liked Killmonger's backstory. Good acting. Good emotional moments. The message behind the movie is a bit primitive and naive but still admirable. Editing was okay.

It's the first Marvel film with a predominantly black cast and a black director. I also like a lot the African themes and motifs throughout the movie because I had never something like this before. This movie was a nice breath of fresh air. And it goes without saying the action scenes are amazing, especially the car chase scene. Killmonger is one of the best villains in the MCU because he's sympathetic to a degree. He makes certain good points, just like Thanos. And when you compare him to someone like Malekith from Thor 2 (I had to Google the name because I couldn't remember it) who is simply evil for the sake of it, it's obvious Killmonger is a good villain.

Chadwick Boseman is a fantastic Black Panther and I can hardly imagine anyone else in this role. I was so sad when I heard he had passed away. Rest in Power. Also, all these racists who spammed 0/10 reviews for political reasons because the movie features black people are laughably pathetic."

The movie visually looks amazing and the CGI is not as bad as I thought it would be. I love how they illustrated Wakanda and all the tribes and people within it. The characters are very likable and the actors who portray them did a great job. Although, like almost every other film, it does have its flaws. Despite the cringy jokes, some scenes and dialogue feel unnecessary. As if you took them out, it would make no difference or even matter to the original cut.

Up until today I had only seen one film and two short features by Apichatpong Weerasethakul, so I already had an idea of his style.
Even so, nothing prepares you for a film like this, because this is more about absorbing what you see on screen, accepting its contradictions and in a certain way within its structure and plot mechanism to associate some kind of understanding of what it means.

Anything else may imply wanting to push the boundaries or to pretend it's something else, but maybe that's also the subjective and personal meaning of each viewer, and at the end of the day I think that's what it's all about.

A big difference, of course, is that the object of our heroine’s attraction in ""Brooklyn"" is a young man, and from there, the two films deal in different social impediments and supports.  In fact, ""Brooklyn"" tells a story that is remarkably free of impediments.  That is not to say that it is free of conflict or drama. Eilis (pron. AY-lish) must make choices, but the film builds so much faith in her good sense that it seems almost inevitable that she will find some reward.  The result is a movie of surpassing sweetness and lasting impressions, where Brook’s contribution (music) and Bélanger’s (images) are as important as the plot.

A very fascinating movie. Depicted as a real life drama that is totally different from the other Oscars nominees for this year. Based on the novel of the same name, that tells the story of a young Irish woman, Eilis, in the 1950s who travels to the United States, Brooklyn, looking for a better future. Thousands of kilometers across the Pacific ocean, she finds a new job, new friends, a whole new life, but what she misses is her home and family. So how she makes out of those difficulties, and finds a way to go forward is the rest.

About an ordinary woman's life struggle that lives very close to average of us. That's why I loved this film more than other drama films nominated for this Oscar. The first two acts were amazing, the third was a bit off and cliche, but that's how the story rediscovered by getting back at the conclusion. I think this is Saoirse Ronan's full matured character as an adult woman. She was my favourite child actress and seen all her films. So felt strange to see her like this, because that's not how I remember her, but it only gets better after she does more character like this.

She was very good, in fact, she should get the Oscar for the role. In my prediction, Brie Larson for 'Room' and Ronan are the top contenders, but if Cate Blanchett wins that'll be a great disappointment. I'm also expecting adapted screenplay awards. The cinematography was fantastic, those 50s New York City really brought back on the screen. It is a must watch, especially if you're a middle aged guy, because you're well experienced about personal and social life already, and this movie only a reminder.

While I didn't think it was ""2015 best and most beguiling love story"", or ""The best movie of 2015"", but it is a well made movie. Saoirse Ronan delivers a remarkable performance that really dose carry this movie. The sets, the costumes and the direction were all top notch and I have no complaint there.

Unfortunately, I can't see myself watching Brooklyn again if I have to be honest. Some people may disagree with me and that's fine, because you can like whatever you want and I'm not telling you what you should like or feel about a movie.

This movie is about an Irish immigrant set in the 1950s,who falls for a Italian plumber but then she faces problems in doing the same thing for another man when she goes back home for a ""short"" visit.
This movie is beyond amazing,with well written characters and great performances especially by the lead Saoirse Ronan as Eilis Lacey,who in my opinion gives by far the best performance of the year (only real competition being Brie Larson from **** is truly memorable and very much deserving of every award she received so far and hopefully will continue to receive more.Emory Cohen is also very good as Tony (Eilis's Italian lover).I hope that this is the role that gets him recognized and gets him more work because he so deserves it.Domhnall Gleeson has had an amazing year with Ex Machina,Star Wars:TFA and now this,where he plays as Jim Farrell,Emilis's second lover from her hometown.This guy can do no wrong and I'm pretty sure that he slowly is winning over everyone's heart.
The director (John Crowley) does a wonderful job and he deserved a nomination for Best Director at the Academy Awards but was snubbed **** brings these characters to life with wonderful directing and excellent scenery with interesting and sometimes ironic scenes between the two different love lives of Eilis.
The score is fantastic,it is sad when it needs to and wonderfully emotional for some of the more romantic scenes,the cinematography and editing are also mesmerizing and the movie is in just the right running time as it needs to be.
I loved this movie and I would recommend it to everyone who hasn't seen it yet because more and more people need to see this amazing piece of work in the big screens."

Saoirse Ronan gives a wonderful performance as Eilis, who comes to New York from Ireland in the '50s. The supporting cast is also excellent, all the characters felt real. While the film does seem to take a little while to get going (at least it did for me), once it does it really **** you in. I didn't have any expectations going into it, but I was satisfied with what I got, and I would definitely recommend giving Brooklyn a view.

Saoirse Ronan gives one of the best female performances of the entire year. She portrays a character that is likeable and you can connected with her. Her character is a woman that is unaware of where she belongs and many people can understand that.

I enjoyed the costumes, the innocence of the time period, the scenery and especially Julie Walter's performance who I've always been a big fan of.  I did have an issue understanding the Irish accents in a couple of scenes but not enough to spoil the film.  Although it will be classified as a ""Chick Flick"" by many people, I'm a man and admit that I enjoy a chick flick that is done well.  The performances in this film are excellent across the board.

Saoirse Ronan is phenomenal in the film, as is Emory Cohen. Together, they form one of the better on-screen couples in recent memory. The writing is fantastic. The entire film goes from emotion, romance, comedy, and tragedy, in a very natural manner that makes this one really hit you hard. As a period piece, it was inevitable I would like this one. Beautiful costume and production design, as well as some fantastic music really set the mood for this one. The direction is very good as well, though certainly not the strongest element of the film. The runtime really flies by and you get swept up in the world of magic and wonder. Ronan deserves recognition for this, which will more than likely come."

After her initial bout with homesickness, she blossoms, thanks to the devoted attention of a young man (Emory Cohen with quietly captivating charm and more than a hint of young Brando's essence). A return trip home complicates her life. It's a sentimental story with lots of tears and sweet moments. Some enjoyable supporting characters (esp. bossy landlady Julie Walters) add a lively touch. The period settings are attractively created and the fashions are lovely. It's deliberately paced and a bit too long, but it comes together in a gently compelling drama."

Saoirse Ronan was absolutely amazing and I think she deserves the Academy Award for Best Actress. Emory Cohen was also great. The kid who played his little brother was hilarious! I could go on for ages about the cast but there was much more to the film than that. It was sweet and emotional but never schmaltzy or overly sentimental. It also had surprisingly funny moments-Julie Walters provided most of those. I also liked how they made Domhnall Gleeson's character likeable as well, because normally, they would be tempted to make him a big-headed idiot. Overall, a great film. Definitely recommended."

I thought it was more like a very well done short story,  than the saga I expected (just my own expectations).  Lot's of very good acting and dialog, but I think it was a tremendous showpiece for Ms Ronan's talents, and her beautifully expressive face.

I did think that happy ending with her returning from Ireland, where a deep and interesting romance was just budding, and flopping into her Italian American  husbands arms, was too simple and abrupt . I guess I just thought the Irish man was a better match."
1216,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/brooklyn/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,tjman09,"Nov 28, 2015",9,"In a world where the romantic film seems like such a hard thing to get right, Brooklyn is a great example that it can be done. The romantic film today has become a cliched mess, much like the horror genre, so much so that when one comes along that is genuinely great it’s worth pointing out. Brooklyn is well acted, often funny, and boasts a great story. This film may be best remembered in future years as being Saoirse Ronan’s breakout role as a leading actress.
Lead and anchored by Ronan’s performance, the film fell on her shoulders and she carried the weight gracefully. Ronan’s performance helped make her character, Eilis, feel like a real person, who is scared and alone. As well as making her character feel real, Ronan also had great chemistry with her co-star, and love interest Emory Cohen. Their chemistry shines most though when the characters play off of each other.
The way the two characters play off each other helps give the film a really good sense of humor. Especially the scene when Ronan meets Cohen’s family. All of this aside the plot may be the best part of the film. We as humans need conflict, and recently romantic films have struggled capturing a realistic sense of conflict. Most recent romantic films try to manufacture conflict through an estranged person, getting in the way of the main character, what this film does well is that it makes life get in the way of the main character.
By this I mean that the conflict in this movie is derived from situations all people either have found themselves in, or can relate to making it more realistic. This approach combined with Ronan’s very visual acting style helps sell the conflict, and thus make the film all the more entertaining. Really what Brooklyn does so well is it strips down the romantic genre to a group of core elements and then built a story around it, making the film’s conflict more natural.
By giving the film a simple, yet deep story with a natural conflict that most audience members can relate to Brooklyn succeeds as an original romance film. Lead by the brilliant acting of Saoirse Ronan the film is able to create realistic characters, and eve generate a few laughs. Brooklyn does a great job combining great acting, with realistic characters, in a natural story, that is funny but not sappy, to make a great overall film."
1217,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/brooklyn/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,YellowKirby,"Nov 28, 2015",8,"This movie is brilliant! Saoirse Ronan was spectacular, as was Emory Cohen.

1219,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/brooklyn/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Nov 27, 2015",7,"Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) is a young immigrant girl from Ireland who comes to “Brooklyn” to make a better life for herself and hopefully for her mother ( Jane Brnnan) and older sister (Fiona Glascott) back home. She is sponsored by her church who arranges the boat fare, a rooming house to stay and a job as a salesclerk in a department store.

It is a simple story about a young girl coming to a new country, adjusting to a new life, falling in love with an Italian boy (Emory Cohen) who goes to Irish community dances because he likes Irish girls. When she is called back to Ireland due to a death she is pursued by ‘the most eligible man in town’ (Domhnall Gleeson) and eventually she has to decide between the two men and the country she is froma nd the country she has adopted as home.

Along the way we meet the landlady (Julie Walters) of  the boarding house, the other girl borders who try to teach her the ways of her new life and the priest (Jim Broadbent) who consoles her when she becomes homesick. We meet Tony’s parents and family when he invites her to dinner--and she is taught by the ladies at the boarding house how to twirl spaghetti--where Tony’s baby brother (James DiGiacomo) steals the scenes he is in. We meet her sophisticated supervisor (Jessica Pare) at work who follows Lacey’s arc from being a shy girl, almost afraid of her shadow, or at least the shadow Brooklyn casts over a new comer, to a confident young lady who takes night school courses to become an accountant.

“Brooklyn” is a sweet love story between people and countries, that takes its time
and has only one contrived spot that doesn’t ring true. The comparison of Coney Island with bodies all over the crowded beach to the beach along the Irish countryside which only has 4 people on it is as telling as the opening shot of the Irish girl to the lady we see at the end advising a Irish country girl immigrating to Brooklyn.

Saoirse Ronan, an American born 21 year old woman of Irish parents, goes from
drab to beautiful with the ease she becomes the confident woman in “Brooklyn”. As her lover Emory Cohen is a delightful combination of young boy and a man who knows what he wants.

John Crowley directs the film placed in the 1950s and, along with the screenwriter
Nick Hornby, based on the book by Colm Toibin, lovingly shows the Ireland Americans dream of and the  New York (Brooklyn) that immigrants picture in their heads. The casting in all the roles are perfect and though the love story doesn’t overwhelm you individual scenes do.

“Brooklyn” is one of the few quiet, impressive films of the holiday season."

To me it was just a simple little film with a good heart and an undeniably charming performance from Saoirse Ronan that's deservedly bound for an best actress Academy Award nod. Overall, the film felt a little too simple for my liking and I found it to be rather predictable and cliche, especially towards the end with the whole ""torn between two lovers and two homes"" situation. I also found it to be a bit underwhelming given the rave reviews (that 99% on Rotten Tomatoes is ridiculously too high!)

It looks like footage that was shot recently, not over 50 years ago. I don’t know if most of the footage is new (as in unreleased until now) or not, but it was fascinating to watch.

And, I wasn't disappointed. Miller and his team gained access to the National Archives and Records Administration as well as the NASA archives for their project and I was happy to see another space film after covering Rory Kennedy's Above and Beyond: NASA's Journey To Tomorrow this past summer at AFI DOCS in Washington D.C.

Crafted from a newly discovered trove of 65mm footage, and more than 11,000 hours of uncatalogued audio recordings, Miller takes us straight to the heart of NASA’s most celebrated mission with masterful editing and grand storytelling - the one that first put men on the moon, and forever made Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin into household names.

Immersed in the perspectives of the astronauts, the team in Mission Control, and the millions of spectators on the ground, Apollo 11 provided the audience with a look from inside the Apollo 11 spacecraft, the jocular banter of the astronauts as well as the adoring crowds and the tense atmospherics inside Mission Control. Miller delivers a vivid experience of those momentous days and hours in 1969 when humankind took a giant leap into the future fulfilling President Kennedy's May, 1961 mission of sending a man to the moon utilizing still black and white, and color photographs, newsreel voice-overs and the stunning cinematography treasures captured during the 1969 mission.

[youtube ****/watch?v=TUXuV7XbZvU]

With never seen-before footage and a run time of ninety minutes, the film covers nine days in an efficient manner. Miller, a self-described space geek, weaves a warm, emotionally fulfilling narrative with a strong sound design from Eric Milano and riveting music from Matt Morton highlighted with moments from the preparation, liftoff, landing, return and recovery of the famed mission.

But, he could not have managed it without the expert skills of Stephen Slater, a specialist in the NASA film archive, and nominee for the Arthur C Clarke Award for Achievement in Space Media,  who had the dubious distinction of syncing the audio for all the soundless archival footage (as none of the footage had any sound!), and Ben Feist, a software engineer at NASA, and the Apollo program historian behind the interactive website ****, a web experience that recreates the last mission to the Moon in real-time, who created algorithms to streamline the massive audio files. Lastly, all the 16mm and 35mm archival footage was scanned and converted into a large screen format, 4K, utilizing a one-of-a-kind, prototype scanner.

In the Q & A following the screening, Miller  playfully referred to Apollo 11 as the 'Dunkirk in space' and provided insightful background on how these stored film reels came into being as the failed attempt of MGM and NASA to produce a film together. Miller confessed to always wanting to make a big screen film. Apollo 11 is in the U.S. Documentary Competition and seems to be one of the crowd favorites so far.

I believe the film succinctly portrays the essence and spirit of the Apollo 11 mission in its nearest raw state, without the added drama and chatter found in mainstream reproductions. I also sense the director and editor have taken time to give the film a ""consistent look,"" which again is contrary to the archetypal ""cut-n-paste"" documentaries. I believe this film has provided inclusive excellence with added emphasis of the control room (the heart of the mission) and incorporates diversity in the spectators and those behind the scenes.

1236,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/apollo-11/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MarkHReviews,"Mar 16, 2019",9,"“Apollo 11” is a powerful demonstration that less is more.  It’s a tribute to those who crafted this documentary that a NASA mission - whose outcome is so well-known (spoiler alert: these guys land on the moon) - could hold an audience’s attention without resorting to any sort of contrivance (like Ryan Gosling’s angst-filled brooding, I’m looking at you “First Man”).

This is unadorned documentary film-making at its finest.  There’s no voiceover by James Earl Jones.  No “we were there” interviews.  No contemporary astrophysicists or scientists giving us context.  Director Todd Douglas Miller (2014 Emmy for “Dinosaur 13”) has had the self-confidence to simply go through an abundance of restored 65mm film and over 11,000 hours of rediscovered audio recordings and stitch together a powerful, compelling narrative.

Without seeing this movie, you may find it hard to imagine that this story could be either emotionally compelling or visually interesting.  If you’re familiar with the TV broadcast footage from the lunar landing in its grainy black-and white, it’s even harder to believe this movie could hold your interest.  But it does.  Actually, some of the color footage is breathtaking.  Composer Matt Morton’s powerful underscoring contributes to the overall mood.

What makes this documentary possible is the vast number of cameras that were deployed for every step of this mission.  At lift-off, we’re given an amazingly close-up perspective of the power of the Saturn rockets.  When parts of the rocket are jettisoned during the flight, there is up-close footage, including an amazing perspective from inside a discarded booster rocket that shows the capsule carrying the astronauts speeding away.  On the moon, a color camera taking images one frame per second has created some shots that are simply breath-taking.  One of Miller’s most effective themes is the sheer magnitude of this space mission - in size, in scope and in the scale of this undertaking.  The film opens with a close-up of the giant crawler-transporter that moves the 363-foot rocket onto the launch pad.  (This transport vehicle weighs over 6 million pounds and requires 30 technicians, crew and drivers to operate.  Some claim it’s so large it has its own weather.)  It’s an excellent metaphor for the size of this undertaking.  This archival footage also captures the scope of the audience - the tens of thousands of spectators assembled in the area because they wanted to see lift-off with their own eyes.  (We’re also shown, without commentary, that the hair styles and clothing choices of the late 60’s were a series of self-inflicted, unfortunate events.)

A second powerful theme is the self-deprecating understatement of all involved.  At liftoff, telemetry reported that Buzz Aldrin’s heart rate was what many people experience while sleeping.  When Michael Collins’ respiratory sensors stopped functioning, Collins assured Mission Control he would inform them immediately, if he stopped breathing.  In its own way, this film is just as interesting as the latest films based on comic book heroes.  “Apollo 11” chronicles compellingly one of the “giant leaps” in human history."

One thing I miss in films like this are interviews with the astronauts. I can't believe they don't exist. You never get a sense of what these guys might be feeling – or were they chosen because they wouldn’t feel (in this documentary, they kept reporting heart beat rates but not much else). The pictures were the stunners here, and the event was covered in minute detail. Although Neil Armstrong's smile is charming, I preferred “First Man,” even though I found that disappointing too."
1240,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/apollo-11/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,KeithDow,"Mar 13, 2019",8,"It’s nearly impossible to fully appreciate the size and power of the Saturn V rocket.  It stands at a towering 363 feet tall—longer than a football field—weighs six and a half million pounds, and totals nearly ten million pounds of thrust.

Sitting atop that behemoth, as is so vividly and viscerally depicted in ‘Apollo 11,’ are three astronauts, each with an unmatched combination of expertise and indomitability that has afforded them the opportunity to be blasted 238,900 miles into space to become the first humans to set foot on the moon.

It’s been a while since we’ve been in a theater where the audience applauded multiple times throughout the screening.  ‘Apollo 11’ deserves it.  The film celebrates the very best of the American spirit and serves as a visceral reminder of what humanity can achieve when we direct our time, effort, and resources towards the noble pursuits of science, technology, and engineering.

From a filmmaking perspective, ‘Apollo 11’ hits all the right notes.  The graphics are poignant in their minimalism, demonstrating the various maneuvers the crew needs to fulfill in order to achieve their mission.  The sound design follows suit, allowing the film to breathe at certain times, while ramping up the tone and tension whenever appropriate.

‘Apollo 11’ must be seen during the limited time it will remain in theaters.  And while even a large screen and booming sound system can’t quite fully capture the extraordinary magnitude of what space exploration entails, this documentary is certainly the closest many of us will ever come to experiencing it."

My one and only complaint is about the incompetent fool who decided that this wonderfully illustrated piece of history needed that god-awful mood music, especially during launch and engine-firing sequences, and especially that insanely stupid heartbeat thump during countdowns. Apart from drowning out the voices I so desperately strained to hear, it also severely detracted from the events themselves.

I thought this was going to be a look-back with modern-day interviews and narration, but nope, none of that. Only narration is some from the news footage of the launch. Any supplemental information is supplied by text and infographics of the space flight. I was pleasantly surprised by this. It really makes you feel like you're there in '69. I also learned stuff I never knew before like the multiple teams utilized by NASA for different aspects of the mission and the fact that the astronauts had to be immediately quarantined after the flight.

The whole thing looks and sounds great. (Though admittedly, I saw this in IMAX, which probably helps.) The digital restoration of those bright seventy colors really makes the thing pop. The audio for the launching rockets are really loud and completely capture the experience. The dramatic music really accentuates the dramatic tone of the mission. Only downside is that they play the same music during the ending credits which consists of footage celebrating the conquering heroes. It completely doesn't match what you see. It makes you feel like you're about to see a downer twist ending like a deadly organism sneaked along with the mission or the astronauts were killed and replaced by duplicates because they knew too much. A downside is that a lot of this film is people at panels. I did lose attention a couple times.

If you can't do slow-paced, this might be not for you. However, if you're interested in how the very first moon landing actually went down then this is exactly what you're looking for. (There was applauding by some audience members at the end.)"

I recommend it as much as possible for literally everyone.  It is a masterful blend of original footage, simple animations, and modern film technique that carries you along like a thrill ride while almost subliminally conveying how complex, dangerous, and massive a project this was.

The pacing is almost perfect: the buildup to launch is like a movie in itself and leaves you amazed at what they did before it even lifts off.  Each key milestone of the voyage gets a countdown and graphic explanation, and as the movie goes on and you just start to get tired they pick up the pace so it ends with you not quite wanting it to be over yet.   In general the use of music/sound is really effective at conveying the danger and significance of events, my only real knock is that occasionally it was so loud it obscured actual speech I wanted to hear better - especially during the actual landing sequence.

This is the 50th anniversary and you really owe it to yourself and your kids to see this now while it is out on Imax.  You could watch it at home on TV, but no matter how big your TV or how loud your speakers it won't be the same.  More people around the world watched Apollo 11 than any other event in history, and there's something to be said for seeing it with a crowd of other people.     An unrelated observation from the film: I found it eye opening that even though Nixon was a straight up crook, he still understood what it meant to be president and made truly presidential remarks, to say nothing of the clips of JFK.

Jenkins crafted this movie like a cinematic stage production. The acting backs this up and it caught me off guard at first but I eventually got on board. The cinematography is a huge strength. Laxton shoots some gorgeous scenes and I think could have easily gotten more awards. My main issue with the film though is the writing from Barry Jenkins. The film moves at a snails pace and I think the jumping between times is the main cause. The film is not linear and that is not a problem in itself, but the way Jenkins writes you are pulled out of a moment before you can fully take in what just happened and then thrown into something totally different. I admit this film is great and has amazing qualities,  but I did not enjoy it and probably won't watch it again."

Here, he follows up with If Beale Street Could Talk, an adaptation of James Baldwin’s novel that tells the story of young, African-American lovers, Tish (Kiki Layne) and Fonny (Stephan James) against the backdrop of institutional racism. To meet a bar set as high as by Moonlight is quite a feat, but Jenkins is not one to disappoint; If Beale Street Could Talk is a gorgeous film, poetic, visceral and oozing with sensuality. The story flits effortlessly back and forth through time, from graceful interludes of Tish and Fonny’s early relationship to the understatedly gritty present, as a pregnant Tish fights for the release of Fonny, who has been imprisoned on a trumped-up **** charge. Wherever the film is in time, it is decidedly timeless, a love story told with tenderness and a dignity and respect for its characters. The perfectly matched combination of Jenkins’ script and attentive direction immerse us within the film with a totality one rarely feels. There’s a dazed slowness to the narrative, as it lilts from moments of humour to those of beauty and gritty realism with ease.
The performances are equally fantastic, underplayed yet unfailingly believable and effective. Kiki Layne and Stephan James’ leads are terrific, their scenes glowing with intimacy. The film’s real stand out performer, however, is Regina King, playing Kiki’s protective mother with a poised brilliance. What is so rewarding about If Beale Street Could Talk is the myriad of relationships that we see play out on screen, not only between the central lovers, but between sisters, friends, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives. “Love is what brought you here”, says King’s Sharon most wisely; truly, this film can only be described as an evocation of love in all forms, sensuous and naked, yet wonderfully heartfelt.
If Beale Street Could Talk is only made all the more impressive by its design elements, all cleverly judged and executed with a gentle brilliance. James Laxton’s camera swoops woozily between characters, settling slowly on moments of profundity in the acting before sweeping overhead to give us a greater look at Jenkins’ world, painstaking in period detail. What accentuates the film the most, however, is Nicholas Britell’s score, so expressive and moving it seems to become a whole other character in itself. The score sings of the characters so perfectly it is bound to bring one to tears.
Moonlight is a spectacular film (a favourite of mine), and If Beale Street Could Talk echoes of its elegance and immersion, yet with a slower and gentler touch that blooms with true compassion for its characters and story. An important story it is too, trenchant and topical; Jenkins is a marvellous filmmaker whose love for his craft lies evident in his work."

But this time he enhanced it by the magical Power of Love. And here we have a piece of visual poetry!

Despite incorporating narration in its storytelling, the movie leans heavily on its sensory aspect and its rich, haunting atmosphere
in every scene to convey emotion. With the help of James Laxton's richly hued cinematography, and Nicholas Britell's score which is brimming with love, hope and also darkness, Jenkins weaves Baldwin's tragic romantic story into a tender cinematic experience that could easily be mistaken as a poem.

I have some issues with the dialogue, though. I think it needed to be more gritty, hence more convincing and compelling. There's no doubt that Jenkins' reliance on the atmosphere he created to give the movie its emotional impact paid off marvelously for the most part. But some moments in the movie I found to be too soupy and mushy for its own good. These moments I found a bit hard to swallow, especially when the movie tackles some heavy themes like racism.

The chapter-like narrative technique was a mixed bag for me. While it made me eager to know more and more about the characters and the story in general as the plot unravels slowly; almost time the movie introduces to me a new sub-plot, or rather a new chapter in its story, I felt it to be forced, heavy-handed and a little on the nose at at first glance. Especially, because of the simplicity of the dialogue as I mentioned above. That said, Barry Jenkins' tender, exquisite and superbly elegant direction, along with the massively amiable and endearing protagonists, makes me thoroughly engrossed and immersed in every single scene in no time.

KiKi Layne and Stephan James's captivating performances made their already-relatable characters even more sympathetic and appealing. Regina King is great. But, unfortunately, she has few moments to shine. Pedro Pascal, Diego Luna, and Dave Franco are quite good, but their roles are too small to show their acting talents.
Ed Skrein's acting was a bit hammy, IMO. On the other hand, Brian Tyree Henry (Atlanta), whose role is also small, delivered a terrific performance that made his scenes stick in my mind even now.

Maybe I criticized the movie a bit too harsh. But it's actually way more easy to mention the few issues I have with it than to describe the arresting experience I had watching it.

If Beale Street Could Talk

Jenkins has made a romantic film whose drama may fiddle around the borders of racism and inequality but its heart lies on demanding answers from humanity. Initially, one would presume it to be a film about racism, but there is a lot more to explore than social satire, personally the soothing affectionate love that flows throughout the film spoke to me the most. If its first half is gripping family drama, resisting the obvious judgements of the society, the second half grows more head to head and this deep dive of characterization of his characters is where Jenkins steals the show.

With all the chaos going through the film, there is an easiness in storytelling, the still camera, the illuminating thoughts of Layne, the calm sensible approach to the storm is what encourages you to hold on to it. And unlike Coogler or Lee, Jenkins has never been provocative, his confidence on his textbook productive methods speaks vividly on screen, like within the first few minutes, the conflicts between the family gets bubbled up expressively on the screen which shows his brilliant execution skills.

But then this is no Moonlight, for a brief period Jenkins does lose its audience when the script gets damp, that entire middle act falls under the obligation category, it's that part where to offer a better closure Jenkins had to swoop it up on screen. One of the finest bits of the film is when Layne narrates her version of the world. It is so finely detailed and beautiful written that all of it gets in your bones within a snap, her job description is something that will stay with you throughout the course of the film.

Jenkins may highlight each character by casting bigger actors, but he counts them on script with equal sincerity that leaves a long lasting impression, from Franco to Pascal to Rios to Skrein, each of them gets a unique act to play, that becomes into an antic itself. Even Luna's cameo that is barely there for a scene, casts an impression since the way Layne describes how she observes things. James as the victim of both love and hate, never manages to emerge himself ad more than a pity or a mellow case. While, Layne is the real deal, her carefully constructed and calculative performance is what glues all these characters tightly.

Personally I prefer her in the bits where she is alone, on her own, away from James, that is when her real personality is brought out. King, on her supporting role deserves all the hype she comes with, her sharp bitter tongue whips you for its honesty and generosity. The ultimate final punch of hers which the movie was building towards, her compelling scene with Rios defines her excellence on performance. This project of Jenkins is a bit amiable, satisfied in its own term, If Beale Street Could Talk expands the possibility of the outcomes of a definitive case, in here, the romance conjured by him is his big win."

Add an interesting, oft-told but never a boring story that is as true today as when it was written about in 1974 by the brilliant writer James Baldwin. Top it off with Nina Simone on the soundtrack there is no turning back.

After winning an Oscar for writing, and directing, the award-winning ""Moonlight"" Barry Jenkins returns with ""If Beale Street Could Talk"", a story of a Black boy wrongfully accused of **** who, after being jailed, finds out the girl he loves is pregnant. From that point on we are steered into different angles but the love between Tish and Fonny is always strong even, when not thinking, he says something to her that is cruel and wrong. They hadn't married yet not because he didn't want to but her parents and sister, along with his father, strongly support the couple and, without hesitation, offer their help with the new baby. Colman Domingo as her father, Teyonah Parris as her sister and Michael Beach as his father are very strong on screen, especially with the ways the older sister shows Tish her love. Domingo and Beach have a mesmerizing scene in a bar where they discuss what Black fathers have to do to help their children.

On the evening when she tells her family that she is pregnant her father calls Fonny's family to come over and that is when we meet his father, mother and 2 sisters. Aunjanue Ellis, playing the mother, is an overzealous Christian with 2 daughters, Ebony Obsidian and Dominique Thorne, who are not only taking after their mother but get their comeuppance from Tish's sister. There is also a very unexpected moment in the scene that made most of the audience gasp.

Regina King is very strong as the mother who knows the woman, Emily Rios, who pointed the finger, via the racist cop, Ed Skrein, was put up to it and faces up to her.  There is a scene just before the two women face each other where King, alone, spends time looking in a mirror putting and taking off a wig that is very intense but runs just a bit too long, not that it isn't interesting just delaying the story.

There is a scene between Fonny and his old buddy Daniel, played by Brian Tyree Henry, where the latter talks about being arrested and having the 'choice' of admitting to stealing a car, though he doesn't know how to drive or carrying marijuana with the latter being a lighter sentence which is the one he chooses. Unfortunately Henry speaks too softly to be completely understood though what he has to say is very important.

Barry Jenkins does an excellent job bringing Baldwin's writing to the screen but makes a few mistakes consisting of running 3-4 scenes too long slowing the film down, not following up on 2 points made earlier in the film and jumping back and forth in time though it can be followed if one watches closely regarding the love between the leads and her figure! He, also, has added an excellent score to the movie.

I don't particularly like sex on screen but leading up to Tish losing her virginity and the actual act is one of the most lyrical love scenes ever seen on film and while the director is responsible for placing the camera it is the faces and the way they hold, use their bodies, of KiKi Layne and Stephan James that raise their love to a higher level.

""If Beale Street Could Talk"" is an excellent film just short of being a classic strictly due to the director's missteps but Jenkins takes credit for all that is right about the film. It is the best genre film I have seen since ""The Hate U Give"" and Kiki Layne's film debut is as impressive as Amandla Stenberg was in that film."

Their idyllic time is challenged when he's unjustly imprisoned and she must maintain their relationship, while preparing to have their baby. Director Barry Jenkins has infused the film with moments of poetic beauty and touching affection (between the couple and with her family). As lovely as this is, almost every scene revels in its lyric artistry too long, which makes the drama harder to endure. Still, with affecting performances and creative direction, this is a challenging art film with a strong social message."
1267,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/if-beale-street-could-talk/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MarkHReviews,"Jan 6, 2019",9,"From the first scene, “If Beale Street Could Talk” grabs you by the throat and never lets go.  Writer/Director Barry Jenkins (writer/director of “Moonlight” which won Best Picture Oscar in 2016) has again written a script with universal appeal.  Composer Nicholas Britell’s powerful underscoring strengthens and heightens the viewer’s sense of anxiety and impending cataclysm.  James Laxton’s cinematography, particularly with its use of extreme close-ups, serves up a series of visual images that dare the viewer to flinch and look away, creating a film that is literally “in your face.”  Voiceovers that quote directly from James Baldwin’s 1974 book by the same name serve the dual purposes of accelerating the arc of the story while also demonstrating Baldwin’s near-poetic eloquence.  This is a film as mesmerizing as it is upsetting.

“Beale Street” is filled with heart, courage, remorse and simmering indignation.  James Baldwin once said, “To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time.”  The story of Fonny and Tish is, or should be, a source of genuine rage for anyone with a conscience, regardless of race.  Childhood friends and eventual sweethearts, Fonny and Tish grow up together, fall in love and eventually begin to build a life together.  Just as Tish discovers she is pregnant, Fonny is falsely accused of **** and jailed.  The balance of the film chronicles the efforts of Tish, her family and others to secure his release.  The film’s final scene, in its ambiguity, is more powerful and more devastating than the artificially crafted “drama” we see so often before the closing credits roll.  The messages in this film are consistently hard-earned.

There are a few minor false notes.  Fonny’s intensely religious, “holy roller” mother is condescending, overly dramatic and entirely unappealing.  In fairness, though, this portrayal may simply be furthering Baldwin’s critique that Christianity is often used to discourage blacks from rising up against injustice by encouraging a focus on the rewards of the afterlife.

The cast here is simply spectacular.  As Tish, KiKi Layne delivers a breakout performance.  Tish is vulnerable, strong, resilient, totally authentic.  Stephan James (nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor for Amazon Prime’s “Homecoming” this year) is equally compelling as Fonny, conveying with conviction his courage, strength, sensitivity, doubt and dignity in the face of inhumanity.  Regina King (with roles ranging from1991’s “Boyz in the Hood” to this year’s “Seven Seconds”) is an archetype of the wise, powerful, strong woman.

At no point does Jenkins’ screenplay vilify whites indiscriminately.  In fact, most of the white characters in the film are portrayed as earnestly sympathetic.  Jenkins, through Baldwin’s source material, has a much bigger point to make: that American society, despite the good intentions of many, has utterly failed to offer liberty or justice for all. It’s an accusation that is jarring and painful, but ultimately impossible to refute.  This bleak outlook is softened, however, by the suggestion that even if love doesn’t conquer all, it can allow life’s unfairness to become a shared burden."

The film is based on a novel by James Baldwin, and directed by Barry Jenkins (director of Moonlight, which won the best picture Oscar two years ago), and once again, like in that film, Jenkins directs with a natural and masterful eye, capturing plenty of emotion and heart from his actors, complete with captivating cinematography, a beautiful score, and important and universal messages and themes of family, as well as love and acceptance, no matter the race or color of a person. Overall, it may seem rather quiet and understated on the surface, but under it, it has plenty of heart and beauty within it's messages/themes, and everything that the film conveys onscreen."
1269,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/if-beale-street-could-talk/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TrevorsView,"Jan 3, 2019",7,"Okay, here is my first review of 2019, which I will discuss while sharing with you what 2018 meant for me. Much like Barry Jenkins’ latest work, it turned out very similar to my own year of personal issues. In fact, movies took up the year and went on to influence other personal relationships of mine. It was an awry balance between happiness beside the mandatory events that brought my spirits down and seeing the two merge. This balance gets captured in If Beale Street Could Talk as it shows a young woman’s judgment tested.

Not that its depiction of the judgment hits all the marks though, as this still lacks the strength of the parents’ involvement in the core plot. They each develop too weak a redemptive arc while their nineteen-year-old daughter carries a new baby, and her twenty-two-year-old boyfriend goes behind bars. Mom and Dad’s impact would have turned stronger without the voiceover narration, which right now sounds straight from a novel.

The characters themselves don’t make the dialogue that much better though, as some say discomforting phrases like, “The White man has got to be the devil,” which could shut off a few viewers. It’s a consequence of Jenkins’ anti-marriage script that does not focus enough time between the main protagonist, Tish, and her relatives, something important for the story to take on its full intended purpose. Yet it ironically helps strengthen the bond between Tish and her other half, Alonzo, or as she only refers to him as, “Fonny,” a name that dates to their childhood.

The weak details, including some distractingly bad Italian accents, strangely enough help preserve the strong little details. For this movie, it is a record player Fonny turns on as relaxing sex music. These slow moments of high tension keep up thanks to the killer performances of the whole cast that help turn on painful feels that want to set off the happy thoughts. Thus, the incredibly average screenplay can be ignored.

In fact, the theme keeps up in such subtle queues from the very first frame to the last; Tish and Fonny start off wearing coordinated morning glory flower outfits, then the motif of colors keeps up until the impactful finale when those colors take on a gloomier aura. Of some bad emotions felt, Fonny projects vocally how his dark skin makes him hate living in America.

Therefore, Barry Jenkins properly decides to implement monochrome photographs of the past national pain. With the expert editing, we can forget the fun high-speed 1990s thrillers, for the somber tone conveys how these people always remain deeply hurt behind a smile; Fonny’s face, behind glass, dissolves into a building of architecture resembling prison bars. In the conversations Tish and Fonny share on either side of this glass barrier, their faces almost resemble mugshots of close friends. These are just some of the bad memories provoked that seem to lift the good memories higher. By then, a mere record player takes on greater meaning, right?

Every actor should be praised above all else for their ability to put a lump in your throat with their roller coaster emotional changes through laughing, then crying. That particularly goes to the mom, played flawlessly by Regina King (American Crime, Seven Seconds), whose transparent fear from new tasks mirrors back doubt when trying on a wig before she leaves America. It’s equally wonderful to see the bright, smiley cast work together in Tish’s perfume shop job, as troublesome as she describes it being.

2018 gave me great sources of positivity, even when my cinema watching strangely decreased by December due to other commitments. Optimism always continued during not-fun things; for me, it was putting marmalade in my post-workout drink to sustain high spirits despite other roommate problems. Yes, stuff always went on throughout the year even when it didn’t feel that way; I drove my first rental car from Phoenix to Tucson then back again, appeared on TV three different times, cooked a lot, went to my first live magic show, got two different job promotions, all evidence for myself how film shouldn’t serve a sole source of joy in life.

That’s 2018: a year that came out good mostly for me, even when the negatives were still critical to understand. With that, this magical end of the year always triumphs in bringing out our most reflective selves, much like the impact If Beale Street Could Talk will do to you."

However, despite these many attributes, the film is somewhat bogged down by excessively lingering imagery and protracted dialogue that both go on a little too long, needlessly slowing the narrative's pace. What's more, in an attempt to avoid being too heavy-handed, the director at times uses a little too much restraint in his storytelling, keeping the picture from having an impact as strong as it might have been. In all, a fine effort in many regards, though one that I wish could have been a little better. But, considering what it had to live up to, that would have been a tall order for any filmmaker."

What’s to forgive? Crime pays!

However well done, the emotional valence of this film is ancillary to the key element of the plot: Lee’s venture into white-collar crime, specifically the creating and forging of letters written by deceased sharp-tongued celebrities—Dorothy Parker, Lillian Hellman, and Noel Coward among them — and the sale of those letters to unsuspecting dealers. Welcome to the caper film.

There’s tension here — will she get caught? — but also repetition (writing, forging, selling, repeat). Because the film is “based on a true story,” one can assume that most of this illicit activity really happened, that Lee Israel forged and sold some 400 letters. That’s a lot of crime, presumably with real economic consequences for the victims. Except there appear to be no consequences of note, and we’re shown no one being damaged. The implication is that those who were scammed were elites who could bear the cost of the fraud, as well as professionals who should have known better.

The most profound result of Lee’s tenure as a forger is that she discovers her “voice.” There’s a tragic element to this discovery. The voice she finds is less than original, associated with Parker and Coward and that earlier generation of writers. But there is also, for Lee, exhilaration. Her forgery career was “the best time of my life,” she explains to the judge, a time that allowed her to understand that she could use her essence—the same foul-mouthed, barbed wit that got her fired — to make money in the literary marketplace. There are signs, too — a cloying touch, perhaps—that the experience has given Lee a new emotional maturity: tears with an ailing (from AIDS) Jack Hock (wonderfully portrayed by Richard E. Grant) in the bar, a renewed interest in reading the bookseller’s short-story manuscript.

As unlikely as it is that extrovert Jack can help introvert Lee, their story is the emotional heart of the film, raising the issue of whether Lee is capable of caring about or opening up to the people around her, whoever they might be. Although a quick take on Lee is that she’s an incorrigible misanthrope, she’s actually neither unlikeable nor insensitive. In a speech she makes at the end of the film to the judge who will sentence her, she reveals herself to be quite self-aware. Lee may not have a heart of gold (thank goodness), but she does have a heart. McCarthy is at her best in this speech, and her acting is solid throughout the film, capturing Lee’s neurotic interiority. McCarthy has been talked about for a possible Oscar nomination, and, while she’s very good here, perhaps it’s the conversion of a superb comic into a serious actor that’s drawing that level of attention."

Desperation, skyhigh NYC rents, plenty of booze, and creeping old age all play into the writer's collapsing world as she's fired by her employer, left by her agent, and hounded by her landlord, all alone without a partner/girlfriend.

Directed by Marielle Heller, with a screenplay by Nicole Holofcener (who was originally attached to direct) and Jeff Whitty, Can You Ever Forgive Me? is based on Lee Israel's 2008 memoir. Taking the form of a buddy crime caper in which two mismatched rogues are thrown together by circumstances, if you strip away the easily-digestible/easily-marketable surface, you'll find that Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a surprisingly moving study of loneliness. Set in New York in 1991, the film tells the story of Lee Israel (Melissa McCarthy), formerly a best-selling biographer, who turned to forging letters from deceased celebrities to make ends meet. However, what it's really about is two exceptionally flawed people - Israel and her only friend, Jack Hock (Richard E. Grant). Funny in places, the film is very much anchored by its two leads, who show us that behind the acerbic façade these two people have constructed for themselves, they are vulnerable, lonely, scared, and crying out for meaningful human companionship.

Absolutely committing to her performance, Melissa McCarthy completely immerses herself in Israel, in what is easily her best role to date. Helped in no small part by Arjun Bhasin's frumpy costume design and Linda D. Flowers's less-than-flattering hairstyling, Israel seems organically fused to Stephen H. Carter's production design, with her world one of dirty browns, dark beiges, and neutralising greys. Both the film and McCarthy lean into the fact that Israel is such a contentious, contrary, and unlikable individual. In an early scene at a party, for example, Israel steals toilet rolls, some shrimp, and someone's jacket. At one point, her exacerbated agent, Marjorie (Jane Curtin) tells her, ""either become a nicer person or make a name for yourself. As an unknown, you can't be such a b---h.""

However, what makes the performance so good is that no matter how cruel Israel is, no matter how irreverent and combative, her loneliness is always there to see, making it difficult to dislike her as much as we should. Yes, her exterior is **** and calloused, but it serves to cover up not insignificant pain. Yes, she can be unjustifiably misanthropic, but she's also extremely vulnerable. McCarthy plays Israel as her own worst enemy, a deeply sad woman, whose acerbity is both a cause and a result of her situation.

She's perfectly matched by Richard E. Grant, who plays Jack as a rouge's rouge, difficult to pin down (when Lee asks him what he does, he replies, ""oh, this and that. Mainly that""), a mischievous shark-ish smile permanently on his face, never one to let minor things like homelessness or drug addiction get him down. Their chemistry is perfectly modulated, and their scenes together (which take up about half of the film) are so well written and performed, so hilariously denigrating and quick-witted, you'd be happy to sit there watching them all day.

One of the most interesting aspects of the film is the pride that Israel takes in the forgeries. Yes, it's criminal, but she takes the work very seriously and is proud of the results. When Jack mentions what she's doing is not dissimilar to the **** Diaries, she momentarily beams with pride. At a later point, when Jack expresses disdain for the importance of the forgeries, Israel chastises him, telling him the letters are ""a portal into a better time and a better place when people still respected the written word"", following this up with the curt, ""respect what you're selling"". She may be a criminal, but she has reverence for what she does.

Interestingly, in the book, Israel says she was uncomfortable with the fact that due to increased scrutiny on the part of buyers, she had to start stealing real letters from archives, replacing them with forgeries, and then selling the originals. Thus, the creative element of her work was lost - all she was doing was copying from one page to another. Indeed, when the film depicts this phase of her forgeries, it does so dispassionately, void of the sense of fun which had been very apparent up to this point.

Aesthetically, the film is gorgeous in how drab it looks. Equally as impressive as the production design, wardrobe, and hair, is Brandon Trost's cinematography. It's rare that you see a film where it literally feels cold, as if the weather has somehow gotten into the texture of the celluloid. This damp and dreary New York is a million miles from the more romantic depictions of the city we're so used to seeing.

This is a film about fundamentally broken people trying to put themselves back together. What on the surface is a caper dramedy is, in fact, a much deeper and more observant study of human frailties, and a paean to the importance of friendship. McCarthy gives a monumental performance, and hopefully, it will lead to more dramatic roles down the line."

Can You Ever Forgive Me?

Heller's Scorsese-like invasion on literary world ensues chaos with equal sincerity where the stakes might not be white or black and life or death, but its pragmatic theme surely makes it look like one. The structure follows a typical textbook method, with the first act being the chase of the thrills and the rush of accounting yourself as an outlaw, while the second one challenged equally by the opposite force followed by the last one that dwells on the pitfall of our protagonist. And as often does these biographies ask for, the makers ought to highlight the time period by various montages that helps them fast forward and keep the pace persistent. Among many metaphors that offers a husky layer on the narration, personally I connected the most with the cat. From her down fall to her resisting her way up the ladder, she basically represents the inner soul of our protagonist.

And if considering the supporting characters, Welles that helps and befriends McCarthy from stage one has a powerful character on paper, she emits guilt out of McCarthy and that is one of the strongest emotion that the film has to deliver and with McCarthy's jaw dropping performance, she hits the ball out of the park. McCarthy has never been short on her range, she has delivered the peaks of both ends, and has come back and widen it once again overpowering her own previous work.

She can be the least serious person in the room and also be the most one, she can be intense with those dead eyes and hilarious in her imitations, she colors her face with pity and guilt and she can express sharp cunningness in her body language. She is in one of those elite group of actors, that can do both comedy and drama nonchalantly. And supporting her thoroughly on the screen is Grant in his version of a mean street guy.

To be fair, he has a much more cinematic role than McCarthy. McCarthy might be the brains of all, but she doesn't know how to utilize it at its peak, how to glorify each moment, how to be celebratory and be bratty, boasting her skills without any shame in her bones, this is where Grant comes in. He charges at the screen like never before, he is always the anticipated antic in the script, he has a buoyant and layered character that keeps engulfing us for more chaos.

There is no order in his rhythm, he can be the guilty pleasures of the tale, he is easily seduced and so are we in his realm. Their humorous equation and instant connection in their first encounter is a smartly written act but their last meeting steals all the attention, striking horns of screen, these two high calibered actors are giving one of their best work. Can You Ever Forgive Me? grows more intense as much as the characters takes things lightly, it's that fear that ticks behind the screen, the greatest armor of Heller."

Can You Ever Forgive Me? se presentó en el Toronto International Film Festival del 2018 en donde recibió un lote de críticas que la ubican como una de las películas mejor críticadas del 2018 en Metacritic con un enorme 87. Ésta es una película de culto sobre un perfil de sutil impacto en la historia americana. Y es esa sutileza lo que lleva al personaje a la magnificencia, aunque haya sido después de su fallecimiento en el 2014.
Lee Israel fue una escritora de biografías extendidas sobre personalidades igual de ""underground"" que ella. El logro que tuvo con esas biografías se lo debe a la forma en la que se identificaba con esas personalidades, y al escribir sobre ellas con gran intención, sentía que construía una trayectoria misma sobre la que valdría la pena que alguien más escribiera. Sin embargo, poco a poco, su recepción bajó, sus investigaciones dejaron de ser motivadas y su economía fue deficiente. Sin ideas, sin inspiración y sin dinero, las editoriales dejaron de interesarse en sus propuestas y desertó. Hasta que un interesante accidente despertó vida y chispa de nuevo en su trayectoria como escritora.
Filmada en una Manhattan de los 90s, el trabajo cinematográfico hace un buen intento de vestir y personalizar a Melissa McCarthy como una chica apagada y resignada, pero consciente de su necesidad por un sustento económico. La fotografía no es espectacular pero la corrección de color es la que mantiene la estabilidad de la imagen con la época, pues se eliminan los contrastes y aprovecha la calidez o la frialdad del momento.
Este es un momento importante para McCarthy, pues, prácticamente, éste es su primer papel dramático. Ella, junto a Richard E. Grant generan una interacción suficiente y puntual a la intención de sus personajes. Y mientras E. Grant lo decora con elocuencia, McCarthy se muestra como una persona sin escrúpulos y desapegada de la gravedad de sus acciones pero sensible ante las únicas cosas que más le importan: ella y su gato. Claro, aprovecha un rol sin una carga emocional pesada y que permita implementar su habilidad cómica, pero también sorprende un par de veces con la intensidad de su reacción. Personalmente, mi admiración está en su capacidad de generar esas reacciones, pero considero que el nivel de intensidad puede ser complementado.
El guión no le permite ni a McCarthy ni a E. Grant, tener un dialogo complejo y la tensión que maneja es casi infantil y se siente como dos niños jugando. Aún, cuando el conflicto crece, sus personalidades son suficientemente serenas como para anular la tensión. Por otro lado, la historia que cuentan está llena de intrigas y sensibilidades y les permite tomar decisiones inteligentes que construyen conflictos entre ellos en la que la resolución evidencía el sentido de conveniencia con la actúan. A pesar de que McCarthy no haya sido la sorpresa dramática del año, sí demuestra que puede introducirse al mundo del cine relevante. Y en una historia sobre la cotidianidad en un lugar lleno de oportunidades, el valor de una persona se reduce en el valor de su público. Lee Israel será recordada por darle personalidad a varios personajes de la historia literaria del país y Melissa McCarthy por representar a alguien cuyo valor propio lo encontró, entre las gracias de la vida y las complejidades personales, en sus propias palabras y su propia personalidad. Aquella que escribió las cartas a las que los coleccionistas llamaban ""invaluables""."

But I suppose the third time's the proverbial charm with ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" which not only shakes out to be McCarthy's best movie in quite some time, but the one containing the finest performance work I've seen from her as an actor. McCarthy's Lee Israel is caustically sardonic, brilliantly sad, and devilishly complicated in a moral sense. The entirety of this film's success hinges on McCarthy's performance, and she doesn't let the audience down. Though, that's not to say supporting actor Richard E. Grant and Heller herself don't do their fair share of heavy lifting in the appropriate places. At the end of the day, I was pretty shocked that this was as good as it ended up being. And McCarthy is largely the reason why. We're good, Melissa. We're good."

I like the part where she falls over.

OK, on a serious note...

‘Can You Ever Forgive Me?’ is a compelling true story that's both hilarious yet heartbreaking. The biggest giveaway I got when the movie ended - you can find the irony and humor in the darkest of outcomes.

I’m not the biggest fan of Melissa McCarthy, if I have to be honest. I don’t find her funny and ‘Happytime Murders’ left a cold impression on me. Ironically, I wanted some sort of apology after that. Still, nothing against her personal just not my cup of tea. However, I’m thrilled to see McCarthy showcase her acting chops while bringing her comedic roots into the mix. She breathes life into a struggling writer, Lee Israel. Whenever she’s drinking alcohol in the afternoon, stealing toilet roll, living in a filthy apartment, and committing a crime that made her famous. I hope she considers more dramatic roles in the future.

Richard E. Grant, on the other hand, is absolutely hysterical as Jack Hock, Lee’s best friend. Grant has been in some many movies and TV show that you don’t have to remember his name to recognize him. It’s satisfying to see credit where credit is due. Providing hearty laughs and emotional depth. Both Grant and McCarthy are utterly delightful together.

Marielle Heller directing isn’t anything special, but she takes a true story (dramatize or not), and made it personal despite following criminal activity. I thought her previous movie ‘The Diary of a Teenage Girl’ was visually interesting to say the least, and I'm looking forward to seeing her take on Fred Rogers with Tom Hanks. Also, the script ties together with sharp humor, which I feel Grant and McCarthy did most of the writing on the spot, mostly McCarthy who is best known for ad-lib.

For problems: The films score is a little pushy, especially in a few scenes when it was played inappropriately. The movie tries to show sympathy towards Lee’s actions and crimes is questionable at best. I mean, when reflecting back, she’s kind of a terrible person. The movie itself is perfectly fine - the performances and writing is what makes it stand out. Nothing groundbreaking or anything super memorable in a few years time, but that doesn't always mean bad. There’s plenty of good things to admire and enjoy.

Overall rating: Will recommend. Forgiveness? Maybe."

Her character isn't especially likable or pleasant, but McCarthy manages to make her appealing. Her friendship with an equally-acerbic man (a delightful Richard E. Grant), brings moments of levity to an otherwise unhappy life. Since it's obvious where the plot will take us, it's up to the actors and director Marielle Heller to make this film an enjoyable insight in this real person's skilled mind and stunted heart. They all succeed."
1299,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/can-you-ever-forgive-me/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,netflic,"Nov 12, 2018",7,"It is an adaptation of a book with the same name about a biographer Lee Israel who turned to illegal tricks after she could not get published any longer.

To make a living, Lee forged and sold several hundred letters of famous people to collectors and antics' shops before she got caught.

Lee is played by Melissa McCarty, and her performance is outstanding.

The subject of the movie was not very interesting to me yet the way the film was made turned my experience rather enjoyable.

Plenty of sour humor here but I would not call it a comedy; it is a drama with some comic relief.

The atmosphere of New York circa 1980-1990 is very good one as well."

1301,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/can-you-ever-forgive-me/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Nov 9, 2018",8,"Every comedian/comedienne wants to also be known as a dramatic actor who can handle the ‘heavy’ parts and as in “St. Vincent” playing opposite Bill Murray giving a hint of the possibility in “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” Melissa McCarthy leaves no doubt she can handle the full spectrum of acting. From bleak humor to alternating between sympathy, hostility and empathy letting us into the character’s heart and mind, to deadpan and **** remarks we see a whole human being who though not likable makes us feel, understand and care for her.

Based on a true story about author Lee Israel, whose film title is based on her book of the same name, adapted by screenwriters Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty, McCarthy plays the author who had some limited fame as a biographer of celebrities and finds herself alone, broke, with an agent who won’t take her calls. She lives alone with a 12-year-old sick cat, is an alcoholic and just by chance or possibly just because of her love of books Lee enters the world of literary letters and the money that can be made from selling them.

Lee, drinking in a bar, meets Jack Hock, a gay man, recently let out of prison, who seems to live on the streets by his wits soon lives with her aiding and abetting her in this new escapade that she seems to be doing very well with financially. Richard E. Grant, playing Jack, is a great match opposite McCarthy and even more sly and cunning in carrying off the sting on bookstore owners and collectors.

Very few people seem to have heard of Lee Israel which makes for a more interesting story, discovering a person, who she was and what she did. Along the way we meet Jane Curtain as Lee’s agent, Anna Deavere Smith part of her past that helps us explain, partially, Lee’s being alone in life, a bookshop owner, played by Dolly Wells, who start to become part of her present, Stephen Spinella and Ben Falcone as collectors and sellers of letters, with the former ending the film on quite an ironic note.

Why the producers are keeping it almost an unknown in previews that Lee Israel was a lesbian and Jack Hock a very ‘out’ gay man, who has a meaningful scene with a gay waiter played by Christian Navarro, is somewhat of a mystery as if they think it will keep some of the audience away though it is a very small part of the screen story and certainly director Marielle Heller keeps it far out of the X rated range. There are a few repetitive scenes that she has in the film that slows it down unnecessarily.

The jazz sounding track along with songs sung by Julie London, Blosson Dearie, Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday and others add to the feelings of a mostly cold New York trying to keep warm whether by clothes, color or music.

“Can You Ever Forgive Me” should earn McCarthy an Oscar nomination and it wouldn’t be surprising if Grant gets a nomination too. The film is a mood piece with very little action or showy acting scenes but it does take us into the woman who was Lee Israel and why she did what she did and why she felt she accomplished something she never would have otherwise.   Be sure to stay for the sometimes funny end credits."

1303,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/can-you-ever-forgive-me/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,NightReviews,"Oct 30, 2018",7,"Many of the greatest writers to have ever lived wrote their stories and ideas whisked under the heavy smoke of dive bars and speak easy’s in New York City; basked in the heavy odour of dried gin, bourbon and whiskey, some of the world’s literary genius’ stories have been told on the silver screen over the last few decades. Can You Ever Forgive Me?, I can assure you, is not one of those stories.

Yet, even though Lee Isreal (Melissa McCarthy) isn’t one of those writers, her story is just as entertaining and captivating as one of the greats.

Isreal, played masterfully by McCarthy, is a frumpy, miserable biographer who has profiled some iconic subjects, including Katharine Hepburn, Tallulah Bankhead, Dorothy Kilgallen and Estee Lauder; the later who was easily responsible for destroying her career due to a less than favourable depiction. After her biography of Lauder, Isreal quickly declined into a life of alcoholism, wage labour and loneliness. Can You Ever Forgive Me? picks up right at Israel’s multitude of misfortune; showcasing her inability to pay rent, live in less than sanitary living conditions and barely being able to support herself and her sick cat, Jersey.

After being fired from her job for drinking while working, Isreal coincidentally runs into an old acquaintance Jack Hock (Richard E. Grant) at a local bar. While the two reminisce of ‘pissing’ off some guests at a recent party, the two share some stories, drinks and laughs together, and quickly become drinking buddies and eventual friends, much to Isreal’s surprise. The chemistry between McCarthy and Grant, although not romantic, is reminiscent of some of the best Bonnie and Clyde type pairings in film in recent memory. While the duo are both very different personalities, thanks to the forceless acting of both nuanced and comedic actors, Lee and Jack bounce off one another’s miscreant behaviour as if they were two hyenas; starving on the streets of New York, drunk with possibility, old memories and wonderment. Watching Can You Ever Forgive Me? just for the promise of getting some of the best buddy-con comedy moments of 2018, would be an understatement.

Yet, no matter how many good times and stiff drinks the two share, the realities of the real world comes crumbling down on them in disarraying fashion, especially onto Isreal. Threatened with eviction and the possibility of losing her cat at any given moment due to its declining health, as fate would have it, Isreal stumbles across a genuine letter written by Fanny Brice during her research at a local library. Thinking of it more as a meal ticket than as a collectors piece, Isreal sells the letter to a local bookstore collector Anna (Dolly Wells), thus giving her the brilliant idea to embellish other letters by prominent celebrity figures for monetary gain. Visiting local archives and stealing original letters, embellishing her own letters out of thin air or adding her own flair to already existing letters, Isreal’s escapades amounted to over four-hundred forged pieces of work.

While the real-life Israel passed away in 2014, the author’s most infamous works still remain to be her criminal activity and the embellishment of these letters, as well as the confessional novel in which this movie is based on. While upon its release, many critics, publishers and the literary community found the novel to be overtly tongue-in-cheek, and merely another form of a meal ticket for Isreal following her criminal activity. Yet, the film itself is a very sombre and lumpy depiction, very carefully avoiding as much spectacle, glamour and embellishment of its own, telling a very straight forward story of a woman who is down on her luck and who’s back is against the wall, left with no other options.

Can You Ever Forgive Me? wouldn’t be able to exist without the quite exquisite performance of McCarthy; its clear Alongside her partner in crime, McCarthy’s performance is so nuanced yet gripping, it elevates the performances of everyone around her, including Dolly Wells, a naive and charming inherited bookstore owner who also shows some interest in Isreal’s talent and personality. Isreal’s interaction, including a very emotionally closed off ‘date’ with Anna at a restaurant are among the most memorable scenes in the film. Luckily for the tone of the film, none of these interactions are overtly showy, which sits respectfully next to the tone of film. Sadly, as we’ve seen too many times in the past, Academy Awards voters aren’t always easily convinced with very subtle and quietly ingenious performances. It’s without question that the studio and actress herself will be campaigning for a Best Actress Nomination come this holiday season, but only time will tell whether voters will respond to the actress’s transformation."

I thought the film was too long, and even though the movie was entertaining, it didn’t have anything interesting to say about writers and writing. That said, I enjoyed it, and it was often funny and occasionally witty. Both McCarthy and Grant were fun to watch as were all of the “minor” characters. With a more inventive script (for example, like McCarthy’s movie Spy), the film would have been much more entertaining. Nevertheless, the acting was very good, and I would recommend the film."

Melissa McCarthy delivers a stellar performance as talented but unsuccessful author Lee Israel, who resorts to forging literary letters as a means to support herself when book sales falter. Aided by scalliwag Richard E. Grant, this unlikely duo stumbles their way through a minefield of high-brow crime, seeking to get away with inspired but flawed acts of fraud against potential victims who are ultimately smarter than the would-be ingenious crooks. Good fun, heartfelt emotions and a delicious twist on crime tales all rolled into one. Nice to see a picture that refuses to dumb itself down to appeal to the lowest common denominator."

While their stories can be simple, the artistic style that Tomm Moore brings to his films are astounding and Wolfwalkers just may be the prettiest animated film I have ever seen. The art style is striking, the character designs are appealing and the first person perspective shots are animated beautifully and absolutely captivating. I can't praise the visuals of this film enough and in my opinion, is enough to warrant even just a cursory look into the movie.

As for the plot, much like their other works, is pretty straight forward and doesn't have the emotional punch that we can get from the likes of Pixar's best. But wolfwalkers doesn't need to be a Pixar film and it may actually be to its detriment. Tomm Moores films have been going for more of a fairy tale feel for his films and he executes them in a way that makes the world feel magical rather than just a film with magic in it. Wolfwalkers is no different and the story does read like an old Irish tale. To get into specifics, the story is about two girls from two different worlds (one from a human town and the other living in a magic forest) who meet and become friends. We've seen this plot before, but being familiar does lend itself to the fairy tale aesthetic that the film is going for. The characters are likeable in both their portrayal and in their designs and serves the story that they are trying to tell. In short, the story isn't new and exciting, but it is the way that they tell it and the visuals that they accompany with the story telling that makes it wolfwalkers compelling."

I was privileged to watch this before it’s released to the general public at the Savannah Film Festival. There’s a lot here to appreciate. The animation is one of them. It’s simplistic but it still looks incredible. Every character, every building, every tree is different and unique from the next and the way they frame these shots is great. The animation style makes these environments look rich and beautiful. The performances are great too. Each cast meme we did a great job portraying their characters especially Sean Bean and these portrayals made the emotional beats hit much harder and this is all due to the great character development and writing. Every main character has a purpose and an arc they go through like the father realizing that just because something may look dangerous on the outside doesn’t mean they are dangerous on the inside. The story here is simplistic and that’s what I think holds this film from a 9/10 or a 10/10. Elements of the story feel a little basic but that’s okay because it’s not geared towards adults. This was an incredible animated movie and I’m thankful that I got to check it out early. Please watch this when it comes out later this month. It’s probably the best animated film of the year and I don’t see anything else topping it."

Al referirme al termino autorreferencial, quiero decir que esta película es una referencia a la referencia de la vida real, casi de cierta manera, una película que trata de la creación de esa misma película. Pedro Almodóvar dirige y autorreferencia su vida con este largometraje hecho con bastante corazón e irreprochable que al mismo tiempo funciona como una catarsis bastante sublime, no solo dirigida hacia el mismo director, sino a la audiencia. El caso fue tan profundo que sentí que todo el momento estaba teniendo Déjà vus por la manera en cómo está escrita y dirigida.
La cinematografía es excelente en todo momento, como si fuera un dibujo hecho a mano plasmando los momentos mas importantes de la vida de esta persona, inclusive la película hace una referencia a este aspecto."
1359,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/pain-and-glory/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DawdlingPoet,"Nov 21, 2021",8,"This is very much a philosophical sort of a film, in that it features various older characters (not elderly but, lets say middle aged people) who have lived and regretted things, enjoyed things, have a lot to think about and look back on. As is typical of Almodovar's films (the director Pedro Almodovar), this film features numerous vibrant colours in the background of numerous scenes, whether they be within the houses of said characters, or in venues where films/film reels are shown and so on. This is a film that is definitely worth seeing specifically in high definition, preferably on a  Blu-Ray disk, I'd say. I also liked the use of light in some scenes, giving an almost sort of faded spotlight sense visually.

I felt the cast did well in showing their emotional vulnerabilities on screen - it felt a very real, perhaps even somewhat raw in terms of the humanity aspect of it, watch, although I can understand why some people may argue that reasonably well off people who have had some success and find themselves somewhat washed up in later life, perhaps don't make the most obvious people to entirely feel sorry for. Still, I did feel quite engrossed in the film and while I wouldn't actively encourage the slightly destructive things the characters do, in response to their sense of loss of identity or despair, I feel I can perhaps understand why they do what they do, to an extent. I also liked that it shows male companionship and how it can make a difference to people going through the situation depicted, as well as how the main characters mother helped him see things too. Its somewhat sombre and emotionally raw in a way, in tone at times.

If your a fan of Almodovar's previous work, or Banderas work (although this is very much a slow drama film. rather than an action film) then I'd definitely recommend this. Otherwise, this is definitely worth a watch."

The plot is quite simple : Director Salvador Mallo finds himself in both a physical and creative crisis. The days of his poor childhood in a small town in the Valencia area come back to his memory, a film from which he had ended up dissociating himself once finished and many other fundamental moments in his life.
In this film Almodovar talks about himself, making a real semi-autobiographical film. The opening scene has such a great visual power that it cannot be described because it must then be contextualized with the film's ending. Everything comes back wonderfully, each shot is never an end in itself but always functional to the next. The acting is phenomenal too, Banderas provides a terrific subtle performance that deserves to be regarded as the best of his career. This film is the masterpiece of the great Spanish director."

A lo largo de la cinta me topé con una serie de memorias y hechos del protagonista narrados de manera arrolladora e hipnótica que convierten a esta película en una obra maestra en todos los aspectos, a nivel técnico es fantástico, pero las actuaciones, los diálogos, la dirección y el lenguaje corporal son verdaderamente brutales, no soy aficionado al cine español pero en este caso cautivo todos mis sentidos llenando mi alma de cultura, pasión y emoción.

Why is it his best?  Because it captures in its simplicity and bareness the sublime beauty of life as can only be viewed through the veil of the pain and suffering we must all endure to be able to experience that beauty at all.  The film finds meaning in suffering in a believable fashion.

I believe that there is no higher form of art than to speak to this simple personal truth which connects us all through the sincerity of one's own experience.  And this film does speak truthfully and humbly to that very personal struggle each of us undertakes to find meaning.  To the losses and the hurt but also the subtle joys in the trials and tribulations of life.  And not only do we have important questions here, but important answers.  Pedro Almodovar's story is not unique or special or different in any important way from many others that have been told, but it is astoundingly honest and simple and that is what makes this film so starkly beautiful.

Bad Education dealt with childhood trauma and the consequences from repressed sexuality and internalized homophobia.  Many will cite that film as Almodovar's **** this film felt so much more universal, wisened by age, and true to me.

I have rarely been so emotionally affected by a film.  Pain and Glory indeed; that is all that life is and nothing more."

Frequent star of his early films, Antonio Banderas, plays a director in his later years…without work and suffering for a litany of physical and mental challenges. He reconnects with a number of people from his past career and early childhood (via memory). There are some beautiful moments of recollection and reconciliation with Banderas making a quiet impression in every scene.  While this film never gets especially dramatic in its revelations, the images of restrained regrets and gentle acceptance paint a subdued portrait of an artist coming to terms with his life and art.

It contains some touching scenes, but the story felt underwhelming to me and felt too familiar and similar to other stories like this that have been told.

1377,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/pain-and-glory/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Oct 18, 2019",10,"I was so involved with who was playing who that the first 15 minutes of the movie is a blur to me! Was Antonio Banderas supposed to be Pedro Almodovar? Is Asia Exteandia supposed to be Banderas? Who the hell is Leonardo Sbaraglia who could easily pass for Banderas? Was there truly a Cesar Vicente in Almodovar's early pre-pubescent?  Then I forgot all that and just got into the movie's screenplay by Almodovar and the superb acting by the cast, especially Antonio Banderas!

I have been a huge fan of Pedro Almodovar since 1983 when I saw his ""Dark Habits"" and have seen about 15 of the 20 movies he has directed.  This, without a doubt, is one of his best if for nothing else the writing and direction of a scene between Banderas and Julieta Mallo though this is just one of many scenes that grab and hold your attention. I defy you to take your eyes off the screen in the scene between  Asier Flores, playing the young Salvador Mallo, and Cesar Vicente, a laborer with artistic abilities, that provides another scene with the older Salvador, played by Banderas, bringing back the past.

Many of Almodovar's films have featured and/or revolved around beautiful women with one being Penelope Cruz who in this film plays the young mother of Salvador but in this one it revolves around 4 beautiful men, including Banderas who grows better looking every day he grows older!

Talking about Antonio Banderas, there is no doubt in my mind he gives one of the best performances, not only of his career but, of this year. There are so many facets to this story of an old(er) man and his journey to where and who he is today and the actor deliveries in every scene. Whether in flashbacks or current day we follow him every step of the way and the complex life he has lead.

""Pain and Glory"" is in many ways a perfect film but not an easy one to watch as there is a lot of pain and a little glory.

PS If for no other reason I will have to see it again and find out what I missed those first 15 minutes!"

The film is difficult to summarize because it follows no traditional formula but, instead, takes us through the life of an aging film director victimized by depression, ill health and a feeling of failure despite the world bestowing upon him  the accolades his body of work so richly deserves. Start engraving the Oscar statuettes with Mr. Banderas’ name on it for he will certainly be a leading contender for the Best Actor Award and don’t misspell Mr. Almodovar’s name on his when the Best Director Award is handed out.

As with most real-life space sagas, The Farthest is a rich blend of tough math, contagious enthusiasm, absurd scale and one or two instances of high-pressure existential crisis.

The scientists and optical specialists chosen for these interviews aren't polished speakers. They might stumble over a word or change their phrasing mid-sentence, but that makes them more relatable, more essentially human, which reinforces the sense of achievement that's so important to this whole picture. Their stories are still fascinating; their passion for the project (and their role in it) still boundless. Those excited recollections, plus the requisite space porn that the dual spacecraft zapped back to Earth, make for a great pair. It's when this documentary is at its best. Less so, the occasional insertion of odd stock video clips and dreamy narration. Seems like somebody watched the well-known YouTube clip of Carl Sagan's ""Pale Blue Dot"" speech and tried to polish it up.

The film's obsession over the famous golden LPs that stowed away on each craft, endlessly circling back to revisit their production, also seems excessive. Especially as the interviewees specifically deride the mass media fixation surrounding both objects. The central story of long-term adventure and tireless exploration should have been fantastic enough on its own."

From the Irish editor turned documentary filmmaker will take you on an interstellar journey. I am not talking about the scripted feature films with plenty of pleasant visuals. This is real. The real life human effort to see and learn about the universe. It was the first of its kind attempted, and so far only attempt. The film reveals many secrets that you might have not heard before in any space documentaries you have seen. What's special about it is the releasing on the 40th anniversary since the launch of the rockets.

Well, there are real footages. But not exactly the real ones. Originally they are stills. The spacecraft took a series of picture, those received pictures were put together and formed into the video clips. Or you could say they ran it fast, so it looked like a video. Black and white to colourised, they have done a pretty nice work on that. Though there were many CGI works too for our better understanding what's going on. Like when the spacecraft travelling in the space, you can't send another one to keep picturing it from a pretty close distance like in the filmmaking what a cameraman does with the actors. That's how you would see the voyager's journey here.

Like any documentaries, this too was a series of interview based film. That would never change for this genre. There were no Brian Cox or Neil DeGrasse Tyson to narrate the space story. But Carl Sagan himself was present with his 80s, 90s press conference footages that are given regarding the latest Voyager's breakthrough. And many people who worked on the project given some precious information and their experience being one of the first to witness the historical pictures. It is a must to observe their expressions, the story that came straight from the source, stunningly.

The year was 1977. The man was already been on the Moon. The next attempt should have been the Mars. But that's another NASA story. They wanted beyond that, to see the actual universe. The technology was pretty good, though nothing like the present generation. But the great feast is, it was nearly half a century old attempt with outdated technology, yet round the year, every day, hour, minute, never it have ever had taken a rest. Travelling at the speed of 10 miles per second, it took 35 years to get out of out solar system bubble.

❝It's a pretty small spacecraft, and it's a pretty big universe.❞

Each phase of the Voyager's journey was breathtaking. It targeted the last four planets of our solar system. Started off with big brother, Jupiter. It was just a passing by and having a close look at the gas giant. Also spied at all of its moons. Then the Saturn, the guy with an icy ring. I really learnt lots about them. Particularly being first visual evidence of such phenomena.

Then came the surprise. I never knew Uranus, as well as Neptune has rings. Being a space geek, I disappointed myself there. Then they said, this guy is not a photogenic. Yep, he was not. He was too plain. But its moons were another surprise. Like the scared villains from the western films. Particularly, Miranda. Maybe my favourite moon from all of our solar system for being so different. Especially it reminded me 'The Little Prince'. Going to the final guy, Neptune, everybody got emotional, for it is being the final stop.

That was the last of our solar system. But I anticipated something about Pluto, the dwarf guy. These all happened like less than 20 years, but what came after was only an empty space within our solar system. Like it took next 15 years to exit the bandwidth of our sun. But what I guess is that there would have been some planets beyond Pluto in the ancient time, which some time later had escaped from the Sun's gravity to become the rogue planets. Because they were too far from the Sun and those empty spaces would not have been there without any reason. Is not it?

The man is not on board, but his creation reached farthest. Now travelling between the stars, nobody knows what comes next. But the Voyager still in touch with the Earth with low signal. I have known about this project since my teenage. But till now I never knew there were two Voyagers. That took me by a surprise. I have known about the on board music, map, human anatomical structure et cetera. It is obviously to make contact with other intelligence in the universe.

The Voyagers will travel thousands of years into deep space. From all, nobody knows or can predict the result of such unique space project the human has ever conducted. I think there's a possible that this documentary would feature in the upcoming Oscars. I'll be definitely happy for that. It is about the NASA's achievements. The Americans would be proud of it. But the world has too. After all, we're all the human's of the Earth. A must see documentary film by everyone.

It includes actual photographs of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune taken by cameras on board the two probes, along with interviews of the NASA people who made it happen.  They're sending another spacecraft to Europa in a couple years, maybe they should deploy a second probe with that one as well, it could take video of the first probe for the entire journey, which would prove that the whole mission isn't just a huge conspiracy involving hundreds of people spending decades pulling off an elaborate hoax to convince people that we sent something into space to take pictures..."
1389,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/fire-at-sea/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,tristanengen,"Jul 24, 2021",10,"The genius behind this film is that there is limited dialogue, which allows for the blurring between narrative and documentary. The story this documentary is telling is refined and poised; the young boy they used as the main motif within the film is brilliant and reminds me of a raw performance you may find in a Klimov film. As mentioned, because of limited dialogue: the main catalyst for plot development become the camera, and the meticulous pacing. Almost taking on characters of their own.
Visually, the camera (the Arri Amira) is distinct, and has a natural beauty to it. Rosi chose to shoot at the most cinematic hours of the evening for distinct portions of the film and the cinematography turns out beautiful. The main complaint I hear about the film, and I don't want to delve too deeply on this, is that it doesn't document the migrant issue clearly, and I think that those people aren't grasping the artistic value that this film presents. There's a place in cinema for a textbook telling of events, and there's a place in cinema for more representational telling of events. The latter of which being newer, often more interesting, and rarely done."

As a documentary without interviews, an explicit narrative, or even much of a story arc, this film somehow manages to avoid fitting into any traditional genre without coming off as unclear about its motives or once meandering in its method. The general criticism that it presents the inhabitants of the island and the refugees in artificial isolation from one another has some merit, but I think it let the film more sharply contrast the comfortable world that most of us live in and the extreme hardships which we generally prefer to ignore, regardless of how close to our own lives this other worlds actually exists."

The action sequences are just simply jaw dropping. The HALO jump, the bathroom fight, the Paris motorcycle chase that turns into a car chase, the helicopter chase are all the best of what they could have come up with. Add to that some shootouts and Tom Cruise running at 100MPH, we get the most enthralling action film of the decade. Not just the action scenes, the character scenes are also really intriguing and well written. Christopher McQuarrie shows how talented he is with this and the predecessor, Rogue Nation. He not only can really pull of twists and turns in the espionage plot, he genuinely gave stakes to the action happening until the end. Tom Cruise is amazing as Ethan Hunt are the other characters of Pegg, Rhames, Ferguson as well as newcomers Kirby and Cavill. Henry Cavill is a knockout highlight as the ruthless CIA agent forced to complete the mission with Ethan Hunt. Both his performance and his stunt performances are the best of his career.  I am glad to have been able to see this film 4 times in theaters, including once in IMAX and every minute was worth it. I can hardly wait for Dead Reckoning."

1412,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/mission-impossible-fallout/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,kyle20ellis,"Mar 18, 2022",8,"Found the first three films ones that had a lot to like (namely the action, the visuals, good casting on the whole and Philip Seymour Hoffmann's superb villain in the third) but also their faults (plot convolution in the first and third and the characters could have been written better in the second and third).

'Ghost Protocool' to me was a great film and the best of the series since the original, and actually better than it, mainly because the story even though somewhat familiar seemed more focused and far less convoluted. 'Rogue Nation' was on 'Ghost Protocool's' very high level. Sure, there was a little bit of familiarity and the basic structure was somewhat formulaic, but 'Rogue Nation' had enough freshness and so much fast and furious excitement and thrills it doesn't feel like an issue.

Contrary to the critical consensus that 'Mission Impossible-Fallout' is the best 'Mission Impossible' film, personally don't quite agree. It is definitely one of the best ones, and perhaps third place behind 'Ghost Protocool' and 'Rogue Nation' (my personal favourite).

It does have a little too much going on in places and things get too complicated in spots. Ving Rhames is underused and doesn't seem to be enjoying himself in a basically nothing role.

Some of the dialogue is also somewhat forced.

Visually, 'Mission Impossible-Fallout' is even slicker and even more stylish than 'Ghost Protocool' and 'Rogue Nation', surpassing the latter as perhaps the most audacious of all six films put together. The locations, from sinister drabness to stunningly colourful, are a feast for the eye and the effect dazzle. The music doesn't overbear the action and such at all while making a pulsating impact thanks to the thrillingly authentic sound.

The action is bigger, bolder and more dynamic than any other action scenes seen before in the previous four instalments. Many are breath-taking in their excitement and also nuances, hard to pick a favourite with such spectacular stunts and action scenes between the lightning storm, the motorcycle chase, the helicopter battle, the car chase, the London sprints and the toilet martial arts fight. Christopher McQuarrie's directing is again some of the best he's ever done, with a great sense of visual style and a real grasp of the storytelling.

'Mission Impossible-Fallout' script is generally sharp, knowingly sophisticated with the humour (not cheesy or out of place) and intrigue superbly balanced. The story, the series' heaviest, darkest and most ambitious, is told at a breakneck pace without being rushed and grips one right in and never lets go, with the backstories providing some depth. There is, like with 'Rogue Nation' an appealing light-heartedness, tongue-in-cheek and suspense of superior tension and elegance (as far as the 'Mission Impossible' films go).

Tom Cruise is very impressive, handling the stunts with effortless and enviable ease and acting with steely charisma. Rebecca Ferguson shows an even better and more confident knack for scene-stealing, with her in ersatz breath-of-fresh-air form. Sean Harris and Henry Cavill intimidate effectively, while Simon Pegg's comic relief in no way jars and is actually very funny and Jeremy Renner's presence is more than welcome. Vanessa Kirby, Alec Baldwin and Michelle Monaghan are also strong. It is a shame however that Ving Rhames is underused and lacking the charisma that he showed in 'Rogue Nation' despite being under-utilised in that too.

On the whole, very good, just not amazing. One of the better 'Mission Impossible' films though and among the better films of the year, if not among the very best. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

YES. Is it because of its story? No. Yes, Fallout has the one of the weaker stories in the franchise with predictable moments and similar story elements recycled from previous entries. But who goes to see a Mission: Impossible movie for its story? So besides the weaker story, let's dive head-first into what makes this movie exceptional. The action is the best it's ever been, with most of it being practical and on camera. The stunts of this movie will leave you exhausted and gasping for air. The last twenty minutes in particular are the most nail-biting out of the entire movie and franchise. EVERYONE gives a strong performance; with Henry Cavill being the biggest standout of the entire movie. He proves that he is more than just Superman or a pretty face; he's a great actor and proves that mustache-gate will only be a tiny blip in his career. Ving is great, Pegg is great, Ferguson is great, Bassett is great, Baldwin is great, Sean Harris is great, and Tom Cruise is... well, Tom Cruise. The Directing and writing from Christopher McQuarrie is tight and exceptional, same with the cinematography by Rob Hardy. In all, Fallout is the best one in the series simply by its strong cast, tight writing, perfect action, and direction by McQuarrie. If this is where the franchise ends, then it has ended on the highest of high notes and I am grateful for seeing it. I shall watch it, then watch it again, if not for the entertainment, then to learn from the people here, as they clearly know what they're doing."

'Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom' features great performances from Viola Davis (Ma) and Chadwick Boseman (Levee). Their characters aren't flawless, yet Davis and Boseman make them each a fascinating watch; the latter has one film-stealing scene. They both truly give their all. The other cast members, spearheaded by Colman Domingo (Cutler), are good as well.

The plot is riveting and very well told, with near perfect pacing and an astutely chosen run time; a 2hr film, for example, would've dragged. The end scene is a noteworthy one, also. There is a lot to enjoy here, even for a story filled with sadness and injustice. Highly recommend."

Boseman’s performance is absolutely incredible and powerful. His character is so wonderfully developed and interesting and that’s due to the good screenplay. It isn’t a great screenplay but it isn’t bad either. Boseman though, makes the script sound much much better. Viola Davis also does an incredible job too. Her performance and Boseman’s are easily some of my favorites of the entire year. All of the other performances are pretty good too but my issue is that some of these characters who are kinda interesting don’t get that much development. It doesn’t kill the movie in any way but I wish they had a little more development. I didn’t expect the movie to take place in one setting but it did and I thought it worked very well for the film. Keeping the story very self contained helps with the pacing and emotional weight to the film as you know something is going to happen but you don’t know when or where. The reason the film is so self contained is that it’s based on a play of the same name. If you know that it’s based on a play, then the self contained story makes sense. The film looks visually very nice and it has a good score and good sound editing. Viola Davis has an absolutely incredible voice and I really hope that that was actually Boseman on the trumpet. I would highly recommend checking this out as it’s up there on my favorites of the year."

It doesn't go the normal way other musicals do, but has a lot of unique style and focus on character conflict and emotions. The costumes are amazing, like the performances. Boseman and Davis give probably the best performances of their career, and the supporting cast like Turman and Domingo are both really good too. The editing, makeup and production design are superb, with some great sets and editing during the music recording scene. However, this films has some pacing issues, and gets quite boring after it's exciting premise. But other than that, it's a very sold film that also highlights important issues like racism. The character conflict is dealt with really well with some superb dialogues and banter. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is one of the better films of 2020 and should get recognition at the Oscars for various major and technical categories."

The language is brilliantly written by Wilson and Santiago-Hudson, but unfortunately the reliance on so much dialogue with little action is occasionally a disservice to the film.  Like a Blues Band version of a David Mamet play, Ma Rainey is a movie that simply plays better as a live performance, and short the wonderful performances of its cast and a timely theme, does little to keep the viewer engaged for a short 94 minutes."
1453,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/ma-raineys-black-bottom/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,ahmedaiman1999,"Jan 19, 2021",7,"Like 2016's Fences, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom is a Viola Davis's starring film adaptation of an August Wilson play. From its limited setting (and by that I refer to the sets as well as the time) and the complete reliance on the dialogue in its storytelling approach, I could easily tell after a couple of minutes into the movie that it was originally a play—for better or worse.

Whilst the theatrical nature sometimes managed to render some scenes a musical flavour that proved refreshing and invigorating, they hindered the cinematic form—and in turn experience— and restrained the real power of August's work, preventing it from fully fleshing out. Consequently, we are only able to sense glimpses of the play's dramatic heft. Likewise, the importance of Wilson's message, which can be applied to social and political climate, is blatantly undermined by the movie's lack of cinematic feel. Granted, Davis and Boseman's characters here are formidable driving forces that redeemed many of these shortcomings. Ma Rainey and Levee, played by Davis and Boseman respectively, are like two opposites that share a common purpose. They have some kind of a tumultuous relationship due to a number of reasons, one of them is their different approaches of dealing with white capitalists. Viola Davis further cements her as an actress who is capable of topping herself over and over again. She makes it look easy to just disappear into many different characters or carry a movie with just her bona fide acting. And I believe that her performance as the eponymous character here should garner her an Oscar nod at the very least. That said, she definitely didn't carry this movie single-handedly as the late Chadwick Boseman delivered what might be the finest performance in his short yet diverse career. Interestingly, I believe that his theatrical performance here did actually bolster the emotional side of the story and, by and large, the viewing experience. This is a performance that's indisputably worthy to earn him a posthumous Oscar. (7/10)"

We're still in the thick of the winter movie season when all of the prestige flicks are crowding the cinemas and home theaters. Netflix has a full stable and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is one of its best. Picture it: Chicago, 1927. A recording session. Tensions rise between Ma Rainey, her ambitious horn player and the white management determined to control the uncontrollable ""Mother of the Blues"". Based on Pulitzer Prize winner August Wilson's play, George C. Wolfe directs this adaptation to great success.

Adapting a play can be a difficult transition since the medium of film allows for the expansion of the theatrical world. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom takes place in basically two rooms, so it can feel quite static and claustrophobic. Be that as it may, the themes and the language of the play is so dynamic that it's still captivating. The ensemble cast works very well together. Viola Davis is Ma Rainey with all the bravado and a physical transformation that enhances her every move. Chadwick Boseman plays the trumpeter in Ma's band, Levee. Levee aches to break out on his own and grab his own spotlight - literally and figuratively. Boseman's every line is infused with that passion. Glynn Turman, Colman Domingo, and Michael Potts round out the members of the band, who spar with Levee and attempt to make it through the recording session. The scenes of all of them together are worth the price of admission itself.

The most difficult part of watching Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is seeing this great performance given by Chadwick Boseman and knowing that it is the last bit of greatest captured for the actor in his prime. He has powerful monologues that are delivered with great depth of emotion. Boseman was giving it his all. Viola Davis is equally great. She walks in as Ma Rainey and takes over every scene. Davis may have less screen time than Boseman, but not a second, a movement, a look or line delivery is wasted. I've never seen Viola Davis like this and she turns it out.

Beyond the performances, the production does so well to bring this hot Chicago day in 1927 to life. The costumes look great. The make-up and body work on Viola Davis complete that picture of Ma as a woman in control. The design of the practice room and recording studio feel authentic. It all just comes together beautifully, and Wolfe directs this tense and potentially heavy film with such care allowing themes to come to life without feeling heavy-handed. At less than 90 minutes, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom moves at such a steady pace that it's easy to watch multiple times. My only knock is the ending being a bit random and seems to come out of nowhere.

Ultimately, I really loved Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. The entire ensemble is so good and anchored by award-worthy performances from the leads, Boseman and Davis. While the themes can be sobering, the film is not dour - it is lively and entertaining throughout. Take your big box of popcorn and let Ma Rainey's Black Bottom put you in a trance. You'll get that reference when you see the film."

Chadwick Boseman's Levee raw and deep emotion telling his story about his mother and father, mother's ****, and his belief of god, Boseman is truly fantastic. Viola Davis is not convincing as a singer of Ma Rainey, she failed of the lip-syning performance, her mouth is not conving me she is singing, obviously there voice-over on the singing as Viola did sing a little bit, Viola did not understand the physiology of mouth when human is singing.

Perhaps, as a consequence of a theater director and a relatively short career. Viola Davis on the other hand escapes this exaggerated theatrical tone. She deserves all the praise and leading acting awards, even with a small screen time. Glynn Turman´s work as the pianist must be highlighted. Unfortunately, under the commotion over Chadwick Boseman's premature death, Turman has been ignored. In short, a good movie, but with some restrictions.

The story is pretty straightforward and simple enough, and because it was adapted from a play, it definitely felt very limited in this regard (much like Wilson's other play-turned-film 'Fences' from 4 years ago that also starred Davis.) In other words, it felt a little too much like I was watching a play instead of a film the whole time, which isn't to say that it detracted from the film's quality, as the set pieces and atmosphere did a fine job of taking me back to the roaring 20s. The real draw here, however, is the performances. Viola Davis is in top form her as the titular Ma Rainey, as she acts and sings her heart out like nobody's business. We're also treated to arguably a career-best (and sadly final) performance from the late, great 'Black Panther' star Chadwick Boseman, who will charm the pants off of you in some scenes, but touch and stir your soul in many others. Both stars are very much worthy of awards consideration this year! Storywise, like I said, it feels pretty straightforward, and the stakes are never especially high, but it makes for a smooth, sleek, and fun watch overall. Just come for the fantastic performances and stay for some great fun and music and you won't be disappointed."

Porém, eu realmente estava mais interessado na história de Ma Rainey, interrompida constantemente pelos dilemas do personagem Levee Green, apesar do título do longa. Além disso, pelo fato de ser uma adaptação do teatro,  o roteiro conta com diálogos super longos, o que faz você se sentir assistindo a uma peça ao invés de um filme, gerando uma opinião pessoal negativa ou positiva do espectador. No meu caso, os longos diálogos de Levee e seus companheiros fizeram a narrativa de Ma Rainey ficar mais apagada ainda, causando um desequilíbrio no filme. Mas, no fim das contas, é um privilégio poder ver Viola sendo um monstro em cena e o eterno Chadwick em seu último filme."

The biggest clash comes from her rambunctious trumpeter (Chadwick Boseman in an electrifying final performance). Being that it’s taken from a Wilson play, you can expect extended monologues about traumatic event in pasts of the major players.

The group included Joni Mitchell (then at her beautiful best), Allen Ginsberg, Scarlet Rivera, Roger McGuinn, and others.  Somebody shot some footage of this and Martin Scorsese made a movie out of it 45 years later.

It's a lonesome road, one of fleeting connections and uncertain destinations; a solitary existence that's half choice and half necessity. I’ve noticed a certain sense of daydreamy romanticism floating around this sort of lifestyle recently, the glamorized prospect of working from a cel signal with the great outdoors as a backdrop, but Nomadland strips away much of that veneer in showing the other side of the coin. There's promise in such freedom, but also great risk, and not every van lifer is cut out for the harsh realities of such a compartmentalized existence.

Frances McDormand drew a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Fern, the wandering protagonist whose compassion leads her to make deep connections with similar spirits, but whose withdrawn emotional restlessness forces those relationships to remain decidedly short term. She's wonderful, as expected, with an expressive authenticity that can make the film feel more like a documentary than a staged drama. Evidently, moviegoers weren't the only ones taken by that convincing act: without a firm script, much of the film's dialogue is delivered by true nomads who happened into the indie-scale production and, taking McDormand for one of their own, opened up to her. That knowledge can cause the film to teeter a bit too close to exploitation, but it also lends extra credibility and sentimental power to the viewing experience.

Gloomy but stirring, with a potent contemporary subject, a number of rich supporting characters (if they're actually characters at all), a beautiful photographic sense and a smooth narrative flow. It’s a meaningful picture, if not an uplifting one."

I didn't know too much about it, but I did know that it would feature McDormand as a ""nomad"", essentially a person not living in a house but moving around the country, following low-paying jobs wherever they can be found (mostly seasonal work) and living out of an RV, van or car. A study of life on the fringes of American life. Not exactly ""homeless"" but ""house-less."" A loose-knit society, all struggling to make it, and all helping each other where they can.

And in many ways, that is the movie we get. Writer/director Chloe Zhao has taken a nearly documentarian's approach to the film. It is indeed scripted, and aside from McDormand, also features the always enjoyable David Strathairn. But most of the rest of the cast are actual nomads playing, essentially, versions of themselves. It all feels very much filmed on location at these encampments, including the very famous gatherings in Quartzite, AZ. McDormand's widow Fern, forced to leave the town that essentially evaporated with the closing of the gypsum factory that was its only reason to exist, learns about this nomadic existence pretty much as the viewer does. We see the hardships of a cramped van (she can't even stretch out to full length in her bed), the hard-scrabble existence, the campfires and camaraderie, and underlying it all is the gift of a closeness to the beauty of our land and also the ""curse"" of knowing just how close to the edge of existence this life is. It is clearly a mixed blessing in every sense of the phrase.

My favorite part of the film may have been simply enjoying the lingering shots of some amazing American vistas, whether the sparseness of Nevada away from the cities, the beauty of the South Dakota Badlands or the roiling character of the California coast away from the beaches and tourists. All this land we have set aside for the enjoyment of our citizens is also the only true way these nomads are able to live the life they do. The beauty offers the comforts of this life.

The film itself has virtually no plot. Although there are little emotional payoffs throughout, it is a film of brief stories and images. Various folks Fern meets share small moments of their lives (an elderly lady, dying of cancer, tells Fern of the time she came upon a cliff full of thousands of swallows and how lucky she is to have seen something like that. Moments like that are when the film really gets you. It's sneaky like that). We learn a little bit about Fern throughout the film, but McDormand never makes it easy for us to get close to Fern. She holds others at arms length, and although she is a very kind person, she certainly has built an armor for herself. Towards the end of the film a few things happen that sort of resemble a plot, but in many ways, we pretty much know how things will resolve during these moments. The film's plot has few surprises; yet the people we meet and the conversations we listen in on constantly surprise.

Frankly, it's a movie that helps us see a group of people we might normally not give much notice to. They ARE on the fringes, but they are not out of touch. They care for each other in ways that could teach much of the rest of society a lesson. In many ways, the film is about small kindnesses. How sharing a cigarette lighter can be a huge act of kindness that will be remembered months later.

There are many things to enjoy and feel in NOMADLAND. But despite all the glowing things I mention above, I still didn't quite love the film. The pace is VERY slow, but not to the point of being boring. I think perhaps it was the juxtaposition between traditional film, with real actors like McDormand speaking character dialogue and having little plot-like things to deal with, and the more documentary style wherein real people tell their stories or engage in moments of dialogue in the slightly awkward way any of us who don't act in front of a camera would likely have. There are many things to admire about Zhao's approach (and I respect the idea of having these nomads speak for themselves), but for me, it doesn't quite work. It made me aware too often that I was watching a film that was experimenting with style and form. At times, images and incidents flowed over me in a beautiful way and at others, I was jarred with ""oh hey, this actor is just a real person trying to handle dialogue.""

Having said that, the film is still well worth watching. McDormand is quietly gripping and the beauty of the land and the presentation of a nearly unknown way of life is very worthwhile to see."

Frances McDormand fully immerses herself into her onscreen character, Fern, a woman who must survive on seasonal work due to her choice to live on the open roads of the American West following the loss of her job and the death of her husband. Zhao proves that meaningful stories can be told with the simplest productions, with poetic dialogue, soliloquies, vast landscape shots and strategic use of sound. At this time when many are struggling, 'Nomadland' is an important story that recognizes one's own worth and discovers the motivation to keep driving in spite of the obstacles.

It features a great performance from Frances McDormand and impressive cinematography, including sunset skylines. It reminded me of one of the directors other films, The Rider. Its quite thoughtful but not in a preachy way and it's also poignant, with some good, quotable dialogue.

I like that at times there's relatively little said - you could imagine what Fern (McDormand's character) is thinking, as she has very 'knowing' eyes. I also enjoyed the musical score.

I like that the central performance/main character is a pretty strong and somewhat independent woman. It's perhaps a little sad in tone and some may feel its a little direcitonless but it really appealed to me, so if it sounds of interest to you, then I'd highly recommend it, yes. It shines a light on people we may never have thought about or otherwise considered - those on the outskirts of society. I also like that the tone the film ends on - I won't elaborate anymore, so as not to provide any spoilers but as I say, I would definitely recommend this film, yes."

It’s commendable that a Chinese national, Zhao Ting can almost perfectly create such a poignant testament to the trailer nomads of the USA. The way she paces and edits her own work is a joy to the eye – there’s poetry in each sequence of her film. This is also attributable to the outstanding work of her director of photography; Joshua James Richard - his stylish use of a camera with strong, steady images, is nothing less than superb.  Zhao also balances her use of music to its most evocative form, and features inspired use of the ambiance compositions by Italian Ludovico Einaudi, from his ‘7 Days Walking’ sessions. Her images, with his music blend in perfect harmony, creating many high points throughout this engaging picture.  In this case, it’s good to see Frances McDormand away from her now predictable, overly dark Cohen Bros works and some other over-ripe roles we’ve seen.  She’s perfect as the somewhat lost soul, living with her memories and finding it difficult to allow herself to become too close, even when some offer her the comfort of a bonding relationship.  McDormand’s nude scene added nothing to the story (they rarely do) but was at least tastefully done, but that **** many places will there be in this dry desert landscape, where you can find an Oasis that no one else seems to know about, and you can swim naked, without fear of leeches, snakes, and ‘human’ predators? Might this seemingly romanticized scene possibly have been shot in some hotel or a closed studio set, and likely added as an adult rating grab?   Slipping co-star David Strathairn in amongst other roadies works quite nicely, and he’s a welcome addition to this work. I realize it takes all kinds to make a world, still, when this obviously lonely woman gives up the offer of a loving home life, to go back to all the desperately looming problems yet to be experienced on the road – might be a rather long bow to draw (?) Taken overall, Nomadland is one of the few recent movies to earn its nominations and awards (despite the absence of over-the-top action and effects) simply for its heart and soul. It sort of seems a pity Zhao has been wooed by the big-time, with a blockbuster Marvel Comic slated to be her next - It’s to be hoped we may see more of her doco-like humane work. Also, how foolish is China to censor one of its higher achieving citizens - because she’s been critical of some aspects of China’s policies – their loss, our gain."

1506,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/nomadland/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,joelgreenberg,"Apr 10, 2021",7,"Nomadland is an unsparing look at an abandoned segment of american society, most powerfully represented by the reality of a town that literally disappeared because its main industry shut down. With the closure, the townspeople were scattered to the winds of fate and their own capacity to deal or not.
At the same time, it speaks of Despair, capital D, of the soul of a nation. The first glimpse of an Amazon warehouse in operation was perhaps the film's most harrowing and dehumanizing moments.
So, that's the good part. Less good is the relentlessness of an empty landscape and profiles of the common folk who live as nomads, moving from place to place. The sense of time is removed from their lives and so, too, is the reality of a life surrendered.
Most of the characters portrayed are not actors. Rather, they are the common folk themselves. Apart from Frances McDormand and David Stathairn, everyone else presents as if this is a documentary which, to be fair, it is. And as a determined plot-scant telling, the documentary seems to me a fair descriptor.
All this said, I felt that the film's many panning shots of empty landscapes and broad, unfocussed horizons wore thin. Perhaps as much as the dust stirred by the vans and RVs, I understood the filmmaker's point but I longed for anything that could interrupt the monotony and illuminate the inner lives of even one of the nomadic travellers."

1508,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/nomadland/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,ahmedaiman1999,"Mar 17, 2021",9,"I found Chloé Zhao's sophomore effort, The Rider, a truly poignant authentic and honest portrait of its hero and I was amazed by how its cinematography draws us very close to him in the personal moments not only with its effective close-ups but also by reflecting our main character's feel of emptiness and loss in the gloomy atmosphere that prevails the entire film. However, I honestly struggled to finally get to its brilliant tear-jerking ending, simply because of its deliberate pace that never picks up even when the story demands that. Here, things are evidently different. No doubt Nomadland is a very slow-paced movie, but it has a perfect tone and the movie, consequently, rarely, if ever, drags.

A further testament of Chloé Zhao's remarkable artistic maturity, and what I genuinely loved about Nomadland, is the staggering balance it strikes between between everything it tackles from its major themes and main concepts to its minor underling details. Most notably between offering a social commentary that's relevant in the present economic environment and weavering an intricate realistic portrait of the downtrodden, underdogs, forgotten and lost individuals with an almost complete disregard to focusing on a specific social strata.

By embracing realism and detaching it from all its oft-affiliated cinematic clichés, Zhao has also managed to walk a tightrope between depicting the ""Nomads"" life as a salvation for our Fern and her likes and the representing this new lifestyle as a total failure that resulted from a desperate search for belongness. It's true that we see Fern striving to adapt to this new life style with all its rigors and hardships while overcoming her grief in the process, but it's evident that she ""belongs"" to nature because that's only where she can get the feel of freedom. We see that her conversations with other broken-hearted people alleviate their pain in the sense of ""life goes on, anyway"", but we barely see them offering a consoling arm around each others' shoulders.

Nomadland is poetic achievement that blurs the line between fiction and non-fiction by representing a marginalized people whom we very much recognise but also by making its titular land a realistic fictional haven for people who find their identity by letting their souls roam in the spacious wilderness, all that while serving as a tribute to the travel lovers by merely capturing the ethos of wanderlust.

Nomadland is a character study of the suddenly ""houseless"" Fern, who tries to adapt to her new life as a nomad as best she can after the death of her husband. On the almost documentary-like followed journey in her van, Fern meets people with different personalities who help her in her new world.  The centre of the film throughout the entire running time is clearly protagonist Fern, played by two-time Oscar winner Frances McDormand. She undergoes all kinds of setbacks and always carries around an inner conflict. She could do better, but wants to take the challenge on herself with all her might. McDormand embodies the basic mood of the film and tells the story of many: she is a victim of the glaring class differences and capitalist overweight in the USA. In the process, she works her fingers to the bone, is constantly on the lookout for new jobs and means well for people. She illustrates what the new situation triggers in her character and how she keeps her head above water. Fern goes hand in hand with the mood of the film: she is unobtrusive, subtle and has a lot of depth. This role is arguably the most important in McDormand's glorious career so far because she represents a group of people who are not seen. The actress lived in a van on a campsite for a few months before the start of filming herself and got acquainted with this kind of life. David Strathairn, as Fern's good friend Dave, is also very important to the protagonist's journey. He makes her conflicted by his obvious intentions and lets us experience the interpersonal component first hand. This comes across in almost every scene in the film, despite the clear main character. The other characters are real-life people, which brings an enormous amount of closeness and authenticity to the film.

McDormand carries the plot of the film brilliantly on her shoulders, but the real heroine of Nomadland is its director. You can tell from start to finish that Chloé Zhao cares deeply about this subject matter. She has turned a low-budget independent film into a technical masterpiece against which every action film with elaborate special effects falls short. The cinematography captures lengthy and beautiful shots of the landscape, making the film's actually dreary setting seem colourful and idyllic. The music by Ludovico Einaudi is softly and empathetically composed, making Fern's rides in the van meaningful. Zhao has put together a film that takes its time, but where all the cinematic elements become one big whole. As a result, Nomadland does not create seas of tears despite the sadness of its subject, but a cinematic masterpiece whose basic idea is always present and sticks with one."

I've follwed the nomad community for some time - I was looking at taking a job in LA, and I wasn't going to move there, so I seriously looked at van living with regular trips home. I say that because I was surprised to see some of the actual people from the community in the movie. I've followed Bob Wells for years. It made the movie almost a documentary. Having Bob gave it some credibility. The movie gives us a little look at the van life community and may personalize it for some.
Frances McDormand did a great job giving the chracter somoe life without needing a lot of fill in. We can feel the desire for independance along with the resulting meloncholy and loneliness."

McDormand's character is as much a vehicle as her van ""Vanguard"", she is a focal point for the indifferent cruelty of capitalism.   The film is slow, it has no direct antagonist, so little dramatic tension.  It is emotionally manipulative, but the moments where it strikes are heart wrenching, but veers away from any sort of scathing critique about the failure of the American dream.  It's worth seeing, but if this is among the best films of 2020, it was a sad and slow year for film."

Fern buys a van, which she customizes as her new home, and wanders the West in a constant search for work, including taking a seasonal job with other Nomads boxing packages at a large Amazon distribution center. The beauty in Chloé Zhao's direction is her ability to play on realism by mixing actors in the film with non-actors who manage to give equally gritty performances. Joshua James Richards, Zhao's Cinematographer, is truly an artist, capturing the breathtaking landscape of the American West, using his camera to paint an alluring palette of the stark Arizona desert, ominous mountains, long, winding, cold and lonely roads, powerful Pacific coastline, the Redwood Forest and glorious sunrises and sunsets."

Director Chloe Zhao's third feature offering is a notable improvement over her first two outings, but she still needs to refine her craft further to produce the kind of masterpiece she's likely capable of. ""Nomadland"" is a big step in that direction, serving up a heartfelt tale about the American nomadic community and its unconventional followers' love of the freedom it affords, set against the beauty of the country's landscape, depicted here through stunningly gorgeous cinematography. However, the inherent meandering of the protagonist ultimately gets taken a little too far in the film's narrative and could have been trimmed without losing anything. The much-heralded performance of Frances McDormand is adequate but far from the kind of stellar work she's capable of, probably due to the understated nature of her character, a casting decision that maybe should have been reevaluated before filming began. While I can honestly say I liked this film, I can also honestly say that I didn't love it, either. Maybe the fourth time will be the charm for Ms. Zhao."

As a film, it is absolutely brilliant in every aspect. McDormand gives a tour de force performance. The cinematography and musical score are both as close to perfection as they could be. The story is beautiful and touching. But therein lies the problem. The story, a clear indictment of everything that is wrong in the US and the inequalities resulting from unbridled capitalism and plutocratic rule, is just too much on the nice side of prettied up by Hollywood for the suburban and urban elite. While there are many aspects of the nomad life that ring true, and clearly show some effort to be honest, it glosses over way to much of the everyday nitty gritty and the harsh realities. As if work at an Amazon facility were so pleasant. As if working on a sugar beet harvest involved just those few moments shown rather than weeks of constant body-draining effort. As if Fern would really betray her values and take the money from her sister. Sadly, the film serves most to soothe the guilt of the self-proclaimed woke. Yes, the film deserves awards all around - acting, directing, cinematography, score. (Screen adaptation not so much. The book is much more realistic.)

The people who travel and live in vans and RVs and don't live in a house are what's called nomads. Long before seeing this film, I knew it was going to be special, and that it'd likely be among my favorite films of 2020, and sure enough, it absolutely is! I was in tears by the end of this one, and it made me reflect on my own life and the state of the world all while watching it. Everything about the film can be likened to a beautiful poem. From its touching and impactful dialogue to the gorgeous cinematography to the intimate performances from all involved, even the real-life nomads who appear in this. Of course, this is McDormand's film to own, who gives the most heartfelt and personal-feeling performance of her long and already-impressive career. Director Chloe Zhao brings out the best in her and furthermore also has crafted a thought-provoking and all too timely-feeling story of being in search of and hopefully finding oneself in such a large and open yet lost and uncertain world. The fact that this film has been released in the time of Corona makes these themes resonate even more poignantly right now, what with people losing their jobs and not having a house to live in. This film really does hit differently in times like these, and it's hard to imagine it being released in any different time or moment than now. Overall, this film for the most part pretty much met my expectations, and paints such a beautiful yet aching portrait of loss and adventure, and I can say with upmost certainty that this is probably my favorite film of 2020."

There are many elements that I enjoyed about Nomadland, because it's indisputably an excellent character study, but there's also a big but, and that was decisive for me to take away points from it, and that was the lack of certain authenticity, mixed with an idealism that tries to make you believe that the life this characters have is kind of a dream life. Certainly the film mentions the reasons for its lead character, but never provides a conflict that feels more proactive.
Life is not easy, that's true, and perhaps it's not a brutal journey of hardships either, but it seems that everyone is happy and smiling at all times.

The material was of course excellent for a documentary, and the director; Chloé Zhao takes a similar visual approach to these, but perhaps spends more time exploring an overly meditative side, rather than criticizing the social and economic conditions that drive or force people to go out and live on the road like McDormand's character.

Nomadland is an enriching journey, and as I said, it has its share of issues that I couldn't put aside, but they didn't hinder my enjoyment of its story. It has deservedly earned all the attention it has received, and it will definitely deserve any nominations it gets in the upcoming awards season.
So if you're interested in a rewarding film, here's a great candidate."

This so easily could have been an angry movie about how we've mistreated these people on the margins of our society, but Chloe Zhao recognized that what these people want is not our sympathy.

The Diary Of A Teenage Girl

Trying to find out its originality and reason beings by seeking, experimenting or even smelling the unknown is one of the finest detailed context ever to be mentioned on screen. The Diary Of A Teenage Girl is beautifully written and adapted but more importantly it's execution is something that sweeps away the attention. Marielle Heller is surprisingly amazing on her directorial debut, and works with conviction in each and every frame of it. Bel Powley is quite convincing on her teenage depiction and is supported with great performances by Alexander Skarsgård and Kirsten Wiig. The Diary Of A Teenage Girl is short (just around 100 minutes), to-the-point, perfectly edited and supervised with enormous amount of care and passion towards the art."
1543,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-diary-of-a-teenage-girl/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"Oct 14, 2016",7,"A teen girl's sexual exploration.

Well, the first thing is this film is not for everyone. Because the contents were too strong for being a teen theme. That means it is good for the grown ups to watch. The story of a 15 year old girl in the 70s living with her mother and small sister. It begins when her sexual urges takes off, her first with a middle aged man. So she documents everything and besides, with her close friend's support, they together explore even more options. Being a minor and yet her real life to commence, what she plans for the future determines the remaining developments.

The performance by Bel Powley was amazing. She was the perfect choice to play that role despite she's older than the role. There were many nudes and sex scenes, but was not that strong, especially when compared with the similar themes of the present era films. The pace had lots of ups and downs, but the progression was on the right path which actually saved the film.

The story was just fine, no complication to understand and also not easy to explain, but in a short, it was a teenage girl's sexual exploration. Everybody gets into that stage of life, but only few courageously opts a path to accomplish. And for some, it is an open opportunity that makes them to get there than intentionally make that move. I felt the film was well adapted from its book and directed by a newcomer, Surely worth a watch, but again I'm saying that it is not for everyone.

7/10"

1545,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-diary-of-a-teenage-girl/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,smijatov,"Jan 30, 2016",8,"An excellent woman-centric film, which is quite a breath of fresh air in the male dominated field, especially when it comes to ""coming of (sexual) age"" films. It is a strange concoction, yet a very effective one. Marielle Heller, the first-time director, does an excellent job with intermixing beautiful cartoon artwork which enriches the film quite well. While sometimes the artwork does not quite transcend itself to give the film deeper  meaning (e.g. 2010's ""Rabbit Hole""), this is a rather successful merger of art and film.

In terms of production, the film is very good. Excellent editing and cinematography are aided by well thought out production design and excellent costumes. The lenses used give that ""70s hue"" that compliments the overall storyline and makes the film somewhat more believable.

The plot is quite engaging itself, if for no other reason but for it's female focus. We are used to those awful slapstick men-centric comedies with their fart jokes. This, in comparison, looks like a mature take on a mature topic - sexual development and growing up of a teenage girl. Surely, the actions of Minnie (excellently portrayed by Bel Powley) seem often reprehensible and irrational, but they are also part of what makes the film credible. Teenagers are weird. They have weird logic (or none, at times). They think about sex. They think about sex A LOT. And sometimes, like in Minnie's case, they are not afraid to explore it.

Powley is extremely convincing in an array of situations in the film and, as one character in the film points out - those eyes! She manages to get through that teenage innocence and vulnerability, but also the strength of her wannabe-Lolita independent woman that she wants to be. And that's part of the genius of the script too: why settle for either one when you can be both?
From the rest of the cast, Alexander Skarsgard has the most screen time and he is actually quite good in the role of the enamoured boyfriend of Minnie's mother. The mother, played by Kristen Wiig, seems like the weakest link in the chain. While Wiig does decently, the mother's character seems to be the weakest in terms of being a full person. We see drinking problems and drug abuse, we see the inability to deal with emotions, as we see the need for (male) attention. But that all seems rather limited, especially within the context of a film that has developed its heroine so well, as well as the troubled male focus of her attention.

Without giving away too much - I'd highly recommend this film to anyone, especially teenagers. It makes thinking about sex seem normal and acceptable, which is important. It is sad that that's an important thing we need to remind ourselves of in 2016, but beggars cannot be choosers. An excellent film with an excellent cast, dealing with an excellently engaging topic, done in an excellent mixture of live action and animation - 8/10!"

I was curious to see if he could act on the big screen.  Honestly, the first 10 minutes I was uncomfortable with the content which I expected.

This movie totally captures the mind of a 15 year old teenage girl.  I should know since I was one.  Bel Powley was so believable as Minnie.  I loved her performance and can't wait to see more of her movies.  Alexander Skarsgard did a good job with his character, Monroe, as well.  It would have so easy to let that character come off sleazy.  By the end of the film, I had a great deal of empathy for Monroe.

This film is not about morality but the sexual awakening of a teenage girl.  Unfortunately, a forever taboo subject in most societies.

I enjoyed the film.  I only gave it an 8 since the last 10-15 minutes fell apart for me."
1550,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-diary-of-a-teenage-girl/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,alandaviddoane,"Sep 18, 2015",9,"The Diary of a Teenage Girl is in my top-five all time great graphic novels, and I have felt that way for over a decade now. So I had pretty high hopes that Marielle Heller’s film adaptation would do justice to Phoebe Gloeckner’s story, a glorious, frank coming-of-age that challenges just about every preconceived notion almost any reader could bring to it. Because the story of Minnie Goetze is so very specific in its time, in its setting and in the particulars of how she enters the world of adult sexuality, and because Heller has been so meticulous in bringing it to the screen, the movie, like the book, is absolutely mesmerizing.

To be sure, the confident and determined direction by Heller plays a large role in how riveting the film is from beginning to end, and the cinematography, music and acting performances are all magnificent as well. But ultimately the adaptation would succeed or fail on the key bit of casting, Bel Powley as Minnie. From first moment to last, we experience her world through her eyes – no, through her soul. From her initial announcement that “Holy **** I had sex today!” to a series of new experiences, some soaring, some confusing, some absolutely heartbreaking, Powley completely and utterly inhabits Minnie Goetze in a way that is astounding for anyone who has read the book, and is undoubtedly no less a delight for those coming to this story for the first time in its filmed form.

When she is drunk on her own newfound sexual agency, we feel that. When she is daydreaming about her mother’s boyfriend in all his perceived dreaminess, we feel that, despite seeing him perhaps more clearly than she does. When she lusts, we lust. When she is wounded to the core by her lover’s denial of their relationship, we feel that pain. Powley’s face, her eyes, and her body language all communicate with us so powerfully and urgently that this seems like a new kind of film performance, a more direct connection between actor and audience than is usual. Maybe it’s the material, maybe it’s the direction, maybe it’s Powley’s fearless and bold screen presence, but whatever it is, this is not a movie that you will find yourself bored by. Time suspends and we are there in Minnie’s world, in her bedroom, or devastated at the bottom of a phone booth; no matter what happens, there are no barriers. There is only what happens, and how it feels.

All this is of a piece with Gloeckner’s graphic novel. The Diary of a Teenage Girl held nothing back and demanded to be experienced without pity. It presents Minnie’s sexual life as if she has the right to make her own decisions, because of course she does, and if the people in her life take advantage of that or exercise poor judgment, and they do, then that’s what happens. As with the book, I felt deeply for Minnie and wanted someone to stand up and be a champion for her, but ultimately she learns how to do that for herself, and the lesson of this movie, I think, is that every girl deserves that chance. If The Diary of a Teenage Girl teaches them to demand that power, so much the better.

I loved the book this movie grew out of, and now I love the movie. I have enormous respect and admiration for what Phoebe Gloeckner has done with her artistic talent, and for how Marielle Heller has brought that to the screen with urgency, wit, intelligence and forthrightness. If the movie is not a literal adaptation of every moment of Minnie’s story as seen in the book, it still delivers the most important elements with few evident compromises. It’s a story everyone should experience, and while not everyone will come out of it thinking and feeling the same things, it’s impossible not to feel something after seeing Minnie’s story.

Me, I felt exhilarated. And very, very pleased for one of the most talented people in comics, that her work has been so faithfully translated to a new medium. I hope it brings moviegoers to the original source material, because there is a lot more to the story than what we see in the movie, as breathtaking as it is."

Beautifully written, filmed and acted. Very human and often very funny. Lots of LOLs from me and everyone around us. If you consider yourself prude, don't go see it. If you judge people--in real life and/or in fiction--don't go see it. It's that simple.

The film is not transcendent or even that deep. But the subject matter is dark, and I think the creators hit the perfect tone. There is absolutely nothing cynical about this film.

Told from the girl's point of view, it's simply the true story of a lonely 15-year-old girl who loves to draw and LOVES to have a lot of consensual sex with her mother's pathetic 35-year-old boyfriend. Will she change? I already told you this isn't a cynical film.

I understand it'll be impossible for many people to separate the (illegal) deed from the brilliantly told story, so I'll address this review to people who are on the fence (because open-minded people will see it and judgmental people won't):

If you think you'd like to see this film, but you're not sure? Go see it.

Don't be scared away. Yes, the material is a little uncomfortable at first--and I'm a dirty freak (whoa, where'd that come from?)--but take a couple of breaths like I did, and remember that this is a true story.

Sorry but a tough subject alone does not grant a pass for great movie.  The craftsmanship is solid, though no flair for moviemaking is evident in this only mildly involving story.  This same movie aesthetically could have come out in 2001 or in 1970, whether that's a problem or not is not the issue, but the low key to the point of nearly emotionless arch is.  It is there however subtle making it more realistic but also less satisfying as movie artifice.  It does not deserve Best Picture and is a prime example of serious content alone trumping form.  Ruffalo does not deserve the nom any more than every other member of the ensemble, that is besides Rachel McAdams who is a good actress but any of literally hundreds of others could easily play this part to the same effect.

1561,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spotlight/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,foxgrove,"Feb 10, 2016",5,"Slow, surprisingly muted and almost overwhelmingly disappointing. This year’s Oscar front runner for best picture deals with The Boston Globe newspaper’s expose of the dirty dealings and hypocrisies of the Catholic Church. More specifically it hones in on the sexual molestation of young boys by Catholic priests. However, despite this controversial hot potato of a subject the film seriously lacks any raw power or urgency. Instead it is content to have its leading investigators amble from meeting to meeting obtaining information rather too easily. Things aren’t helped by the lack of an emotional hook. The victims interviewed are all adults and come across as basic stock characters shouldering all the worst lines of dialogue like ‘Who can say no to god’. Lines like this are so phony that one winces with embarrassment. Anyone who has seen ‘All the President’s Men’ or Netflix’s current ‘Making a Murderer’ will know that films exposing evil or corruption can be nerve jinglingly tense and emotively powerful, but Mark Ruffalo’s annoying depiction of righteous anger just doesn’t cut it. Where the film does succeed is in keeping viewer interest in a subplot as to who in Spotlight’s department was responsible, and therefore complicit, in burying the story years earlier. Performance wise the Oscar nominated turns of both Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams seem quite conventional and uninteresting, whereas the actors in smaller parts; Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup and John Slattery all fare much better. The ‘Spotlight’, however, does shine on one person; Michael Keaton. For an actor who is often guilty of being way over the top he is here at his most understated. It is more than fair to say that he single handedly elevates ‘Spotlight’ to a level way above the mediocrity of the rest of the film."

Started to fade out a bit when this overarching, all-power, deity can't decide whether gay marriage is a burden on the sanctity of marriage or all his children get his love equally. Or if murdering people grants me 15 infinity years on fire, or if I can come to his party bus if I just wish upon a star. Enough about questioning the Catholic religion let's talk about Spotlight. Going in I heard that this movie treated both sides, Catholic and reporters, equally. Also that it doesn't actually make you question the logistics of religion. Either that person was deliberately lying so I'd have a bigger reaction, or he accidentally walked into Alvin and the Chipmunks: Road Chip, without noticing. This film knows how to set up the sensitive subject, it attempts to  ""fairly"" represent the Church's side in the beginning. We start with one incident of sexual assault, or rather the aftermath. It's a short scene and it doesn't show a mother weeping over her victimized child praying for the blood of the Pope, while a priest twists his handle bar mustache. It's just one of the head whatevers, talking to the kids saying the priest will be moved and never seen again. This scene cleverly, and decietfully, shows this as a one-time incident that the church regrets happened. Then we arrive with our main reporters Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfieffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) they all work for a reporting group called Spotlight. They are known at covering large stories and getting to the bottom of them. This movie spends a lot of time with these characters, but it's really hard to remember their actual names. Honestly it wouldn't be that ill advised to say these characters mean very little, at least as their personalities are concerned. But that's kind of the point; as they get deeper in they find themselves being completely, and unintentionally surrounded by the disgusting reality of what the church is doing. They are simply representations of the actual spotlight crew that found the truth as been around every person. This films likes doing reveals, appropriately. There are several instances where camera and editing choices reveal the true damage or gravity of this situation. Sometimes a character will just blurt out commentary over the imagery either right away, or late. Spotlight members relationships with other people can also be spelled out too much. Specifically with someone's (trying not to spoil) blood relative.Also when a Cardinal does something ****, the film just kind of shrugs it off. Those things hurt the film in my opinion. But this film does certainly do a good job of not saying some things, for example the emotional state of the reporters is tracked very fluently. When a character feels panicked, rushed, angry, or scared you feel the weight because what the film is saying is dramatic, and you've been following the characters emotions the whole time. Those are all the things in the actual writing and directing I really liked, but there is another reason to watch this film. It's subject. Films like these are important things to watch, we can really take away a lot from it. This film could very well piss you off, if you are a devote follower of God. It tells you that the Church is corrupt, has too much power, and is blindly followed. Or at least at this time it was. It's hard to deny the credibility of the film when you see the final statistics on display in the film. It reminds me of two things. One, Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. I don't think this movie quite utilizes it's full potential like Do the Right Thing, but they both say something that is tough to swallow. They choose to show the world the state it is certainly in. We aren't perfect but we can at least try to do something. The second thing I am reminded of is a quote from Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. Alex is watching brutal violence, ****, and the **** regime and he says ""its funny how the colors of the real world, only feel really real when you vivid them on a screen"". I think he mean we can only learn from what is in front of us. Well that's it God Bless you."

Most actors were flat, Keaton seems back to his own routine after good performance in Birdman last year, McAdams was like always the same and not convincing at all.

1569,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spotlight/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Axgrinder,"Nov 28, 2015",6,"Warning!  Professional reviewers are gushing over Spotlight.  This is often a “tell” that a movie isn’t very appealing to large swaths of the general movie-going public, and such is the case here.  Despite a good cast, decent acting and intelligent dialogue, the movie is just plain boring.

Spotlight explains how a small team of investigative reporters at a “local” newspaper (The Boston Globe) uncovered, and eventually reported on, Catholic Priests molesting children in the Boston area.  If you’ve read a newspaper in the last 10 years you already know the basic story:  Church hierarchy was not only aware of the problem, but had been covering it up for decades.  The breaking of the story led to subsequent revelations that the abuse inflicted by these Catholic priests on their parishioners wasn’t an isolated incident limited to the Boston area.  It’s a world-wide plague.

It’s almost impossible to be oppugnant of a movie whose subject matter is so poignant.  The problem is that Spotlight just isn’t that interesting, unless you are Catholic, a newspaper writer, or from the Boston area.  Most of us would expect a movie about such atrocities to answer the basic question, who is responsible?  We might also expect a movie in which Good ultimately triumphs over Evil, and the Bad are brought to justice.  Spotlight painstakingly avoids the later and the typical Hollywood happy ending.

Instead, the movie is an introspection which attempts to focus on identifying how something so disgusting and so widespread could have gone on for so long.  The movie answers this question in an unexpected manner that is the ultimate indictment of Catholic orthodoxy, which seeks to imbue the faithful with a belief that the church is both inherently good and infallible in its decision making (and thus is not to be questioned) and that man, who is born sinful, should feel guilty about everything that he does (or in this case, doesn’t do).

The only real tension in the movie comes when the audience learns that information about priests molesting children was previously sent to the newspaper many years ago, but the newspaper failed to act on it, and that someone may have deliberately buried it.  We continually wait for this play out, only to discover in highly anticlimactic fashion that the inaction was probably inadvertent (or maybe subconsciously suppressed and ignored).

We are left with the idea that the catholic community of Boston (which is portrayed as a fiercely prideful and tightknit community) knew or should have known what was going on for all those years and thus, the community bears significant responsible for the decades of delay in stopping the abuse.

While I appreciate the irony that a Catholic community is made up of individuals who, as a result of church teachings, are permeated with a sense of guilt, and thus might blame themselves for not outing their own child molesting priests on a more-timely basis, I didn’t view this movie as involving some grand revelation, I saw it more as a movie about mental self-flagellation."

When I was about 23, me, a college finance graduate from a suburban home got to live in a motel in florida for a couple of months, and hang around the people around this socioeconomic class for a year. It was interesting in a sense that I've met so many people doing strange things - a guy who wrestled alligators at shows (he was my age, his girlfriend while hot was 30), a guy with two parrots who would walk the beach and collect money from tourists for photos, a trio of Brazilian girls who came to learn english, a family from Argentina with two girls being single moms. A polish guy who got a prostitute for his birthday, we were partying before and he was showing me how to choke out a person on me. I blacked out. I went out and when we came back we saw a black pimp sitting on top of him smashing his face in. He ran off seeing us, saying 'I'm gonna get my gun'. Next morning I had to crawl through the window into his room because the owner's daughter was too scared to, to check if he was alive. There aren't many worse feelings than walking through a dark apartment expecting to find a body. Guy was drunk and sleeping and when I asked if he was ok he said 'yeah!'  apparently he was too drunk the night before to get it up so he wanted to not pay.

This movie is a cliche. Chars are defined and stereotypical. (why can't the friend become more than a waitress? Why is the maintanence man not tougher, he KNOWS these people are **** ups, and he is reminded monthly- my guy would come looking for rent with no remorse, and so did the other landlords I knew) And Americans are still too entitled - this life in america DOES ****, but objectively for a foreigner from a hard life country this life would be a great opportunity."

1576,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-florida-project/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,ChesterFTOF,"Feb 11, 2018",5,"Of all of the Awards Season hopefuls going into the Oscars, this one seems to be getting snubbed the hardest. At least, that’s what I’d heard going in to this particular film. The Florida Project has received only one Oscar nod (for Willem Defoe’s supporting role). Much to my surprise, however, I agree with it’s singular nomination, however I would have liked to see it get a nod for it’s cinematography, also.

As an antisocial person, I feel this film unintentionally captures my general outlook on the world, so in a way, I can derive my own meaning from it. The parts I enjoy greatly feature almost no people.  The cinematography is astoundingly gorgeous, and the locations, however bleak they may be, are beautiful in their desolation. The lighting looked very natural and as a result, many of the scenes felt rather intimate, almost mirroring real life. This effect would have been accomplished perfectly, if it weren’t for the main issue I had with the film: the performances.

The characters, which many have claimed to be one of the defining features of the picture, almost ruined the film for me entirely. With a cast weighing heavily with children, however, The Florida Project was fighting an uphill battle to win my favour. I don’t know why I seem to despise both children, and child actors, but regardless, the only performance I didn’t mind in recent memory was Dafne Keen’s Laura, featured within Logan. Still, having heard the rave reviews before going in, I was actually hopeful. Those whom I was with at the time seemed incredibly pleased with the performances, commenting on how good they were multiple times throughout the film. I was less than impressed. Right from the first scene, I found them grating. Not only are the performances (in my opinion!!) lacking, the characters themselves are infuriating. The children are written to be obnoxiously loud, and terribly rude. I completely understand why this is, but regardless, it doesn’t make it any less painful for a viewer such as myself.

Bria Vinaite is giving her first performance in a film. She was actually an instagram model, with no prior experience. Again, I completely understand why this casting decision was made, and I actually agree with it for the most part. Still, I felt her lack of experience was hard to ignore. Caleb Landry Jones (whom, might I add, has had a wonderful year in cinema: This, Three Billboards outside of Ebbing, Missouri, Get Out, and American Made) is barely in the film long enough to notice. I can remember two scenes, in which he does barely anything. The one performance which I actually enjoyed was Willem Defoe (which is rather odd to me as I can still only picture him as the Green Goblin). He plays Bobby, who is the one likeable character within the film. Naturally, he is the one character who is almost entirely pointless.

I understand he’s a sort of morale compass, and he seems to legitimately care for these demon-spawn children, but ultimately none of his scenes equate to anything of importance. That’s a theme that runs through the film: pointlessness. Early in the film, you can tell where the plot will go. Still, it takes it’s time, meandering through scene after scene, rarely impacting the next. When the emotional climax finally came, I was so detached from the characters, I felt nothing but lacklustre contentedness that the characters would be better off than when they started.

Straight after watching the film, I think I would have given it a 6/10. It was visually stunning despite showing very little of interest. Having had time to reflect, however, I feel I am generous in giving it a 5/10. All I took from it was the visuals, and a single serviceable character with a great performance behind it. I completely understand why many people enjoy this film, and I’m glad that it’s found it’s audience. Unfortunately, I am not a part of it."

Someone told me he thought this would have been a really, really good short film and I think that hits the nail on the head. Sean Baker is clearly a talented director, getting terrific performances out of non-actors and planting seeds along the way that flower nicely later on in the script, but the story lacks. There’s no real arch, it kind of feels like it arrived at the wrong time after the release of recent films like American Honey, Moonlight, Room, and others that have covered similar territory better. The ending also feels tacked on. Willem Dafoe’s character doesn’t really go anywhere either, he seems like an unnecessary addition. Still, there are some wonderful moments in the film that capture childhood very well and the setting is unique but I can’t say I strongly recommend it."

The film is more atmospheric than plot driven, similar in that regard to last year's breakout hit 'Moonlight.'  Both the production team and acting talent on 'The Florida Project' did a phenomenal job at world-building, creating a realistic setting filled with distinct characters that oftentimes felt like watching a documentary.  However, it's the overall structure of the movie that makes it a flat-out chore to sit through.  Stories need a beginning, middle, and end.  'The Florida Project' is all middle.  Worse, it hardly has a main character.  Or at the very least it lacks any kind of protagonist/antagonist relationship in the traditional sense.  And by the time the asynchronous ending appeared on the screen, I was screaming in my head for the end credits to finally roll, as the two hour run-time felt more like three and I just wanted to go home."

This indie offering about a pregnant Pennsylvania teen who travels to New York City to obtain an abortion seeks to combine story threads about this controversial subject with an adolescent finding herself over her head on the streets of the big city. Unfortunately, the two don't mesh well, creating a film that struggles desperately to find its feet. To its credit, director Eliza Hittman's latest effectively presents a balanced view of this hot button topic and sensitively portrays the fear that an adolescent in this position might experience, thanks in large part to the outstanding lead performance of newcomer Sidney Flanigan. However, the film's unfocused intent, sometimes-sluggish pacing, obvious thematic allusions and uneven (sometimes contradictory) character development get in the way, leaving viewers wondering exactly what the director was going for here.

Furthermore, the film itself simply feels as though it approaches its intended message (abortion) with a shrug, not really adding or contributing anything new, worthwhile, or compelling.

Its plot is supposed to be a story of maturity, a coming of age story outside the basic mold of stupid teenagers and yet this experience is devoid of functionality when its two main characters are poor in empathy and sympathy.
Certainly functional for the kind of relationship they carry but it's ironic to think that a film that also falls within the romantic genre is so unromantic, since everything in their relationship seems to be based on opportunism and need.

Undoubtedly The Souvenir is a sober film and is filmed in an elegant way but that in no way justifies its narrative poverty because sincerely leaving aside its cinematographic quality its protagonists are not characters with whom you want to spend a lot of time.

In total sincerity, I cannot tell you what purpose the slow and puttering first half of this film served that could not have been done in half the time. This might be my American short attention span talking, but it was truly a struggle to get through.

And what was my reward? A slightly more interesting, but still underwhelming, second half. I think the main issue this film has is that it's main character is supposed to be a quiet writer that's more than meets the eye, but this characters dialog and the actors performance just make him come off as having some sort of mental disability. I suppose this was supposed to contrast to the suave, rich 3rd point of the love triangle in this film, played by Steven Yeun, who's sociopathic performance is easily the best thing about this film. Maybe narration would have helped me to better understand the main character. I just don't think enough context was given to explain his personality and actions. If ambiguity was the point, I disagree with the point. It's well shot and an interesting window into Korean culture with a great Steven Yeun performance, but the plot and main character make this difficult to recommend for me, despite it receiving tons of critical praise."

They seem to praise the atmosphere of the film, congratulating themselves in deciphering the metaphores dropped here and there like a little Tom Thumb by the film director, some even philosophizing on the Little/Great Hunger theme brought up by the female protagonist.
Reading all of them, I was left wondering if any had ever read Murakami's work because this author indulges far too much in pseudo-philosophy à la Paulo Coelho or Yann Martel's Life of Pi with immature failed artists trying to find ""the meaning of life""! To be fair, the film manages indeed to accurately put on the screen the gently nihilistic, decadent pre-otaku world of Murakami and his world of likeable over-educated dreamy but lazy, passive ""sick-of-the-world"" Japanese losers (in a way that resembles Wong Kar Wai's Chungking express). He also goes further, by evidently adding a layer of social-political critique of our current materialistic society. This is slightly too much on the nose however and adds to the biggest problem of this film: It's 2 1/2 hour long!! All the scenes could have been cut by 2/3rd and wouldn't have lost much. Many scenes are also totally useless both for plot exposition or the characters development. The second half of the film is almost totally redundant in scene after scene, for no good artistic reason.
Murakami never left me with an impression of art and beauty but rather an unhealthy habit of self-indulgent introspection to justify a lack of will. Compared with the great Japanese masters, Sooseki, Oe or Mishima, his work seemed trite but content of this very fact.
This is the same with this film.
It doesn't add up to **** definitely won't ""leave a lasting impression""as many critics seem to believe."

A love story of spouses separated by a jail sentence? A family's struggle for survival with an absent father? Well, it's some of all of these things, but the finished product fails to come together coherently into a cohesive whole. It's pointed, outspoken criticism is limited to a few noteworthy passionate outbursts, one of the picture's genuine strengths. It's up-close portrait of a family burdened is well-intentioned but weighed down by an excess of archival home movies and a jumbled mix of contemporary footage presented with little explanation, back story or context. And, in between, the sequences are linked by segments consisting of beautiful but pointless art house cinematography and long, lingering emotive shots, neither of which adds much other than presenting images that are pleasing to the eye. Director Garrett Bradley's latest has garnered considerable praise, as well as an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature, but, unfortunately, whatever the driving intention is here, it doesn't come through as clearly as it might have. Better editing and a sharper focus would have helped immensely, taking what assets the film does have and making them resonate more viscerally with the viewing audience."

She got out of jail after a few years, while he was sentenced for 60 years. This documentary is primarily a profile of Fox and her resilience, determination and love while raising 6 sons and struggling for her husband’s release. With the exception of her sons, almost nobody else is interviewed or featured. Luckily for the director, Fox shot her own video that helped chronicle her fight and her family. The filmmaker shot additional footage that expands her process. While the camera lingers on Fox’s face for much of the film, we seldom get much insight into her feelings (she only cries once). Also, much of the chronology and details of the circumstances are omitted, making it hard to follow. Despite the heart-breaking situation of this woman and her family, the film feels objective and never achieves a strong emotional effect that the story should engender."

Nemes does keep the horrors of the camp in the background, by keeping his camera’s focus no more than a yard or so from the lens, leaving the movement of people and bodies in the blurry zone beyond the focal plane.  This not only makes the movie watchable but also avoids sensationalism and affords the victims some privacy and thus humanity.  What remains visible is ghastly enough, and Nemes achieves some memorable effects, particularly in a chaotic, nearly phantasmagoric scene lit by fire.  (As I say, not an entertainment.

This unique perspective on the holocaust atrocities has us following Saul, a Hungarian Jew, working as a Sonderkommando at Auschwitz/Birkenau. Here his daily work is to herd hundreds of his fellow race naked into the gas chambers and subsequently remove the bodies, effecting a clean-up of all traces of the horror. After one such routine a young boy is discovered, barely alive, having survived the gas. From this point in, although the boy subsequently dies, Saul becomes obsessed by having him properly buried by a Rabbi. The ambiguity surrounding whether or not the boy is actually Saul’s son casts the actions of the protagonist in a contrasting light, depending on viewer interpretation. It is precisely this unanswered question that causes confusion in the narrative which, in turn, has an overall detrimental impact.
The film’s style further distances. Told from Saul’s viewpoint almost totally, one watches intently but real emotional involvement is kept at bay. Long tracking shots, out of focus imagery and an in your face claustrophobic feel becomes somewhat overwhelming. Likewise, the frenetic and dizzying camera movements don’t always allow time to process exactly what is happening. I’m sure this is intentional and in keeping with the chaotic context but, as cinema it is frustratingly unsatisfying.
There are two standout sequences, however. The first, where Saul finds himself stripped naked awaiting execution and the second involves an escape.
Overall the film cries out to be seen (the critics seem to have been inventing superlatives for it). I just wish that I liked it as much as I appreciate it."

Yet, it seems like the director was so bent on having a fresh take that  she sacrificed both the meaning of  the story and the characters, making them only okay instead of great.

It's perfectly comprehensible to make changes - even deep and drastic ones. The problem is that the choices in this film made the characters shallow, uninteresting and unrelatable (with the exception of the protagonist). Beth was sullen and preachy, John was dumb and artificial, Amy was purely selfish without any redeeming qualities, the professor didn't have a single scene that characterized him as wise. The mother was absolutely insignificant. Thank God Chalamet has that level of charisma or Laurie would have been read simply as a jerk in this version.

The lack of linearity wouldn't have been a problem if there was any sort of logic to it. As it was done, it made the story choppy, rushed and hard to care about. Character development was nowhere to be found. Any possible reason as to why each one acted the way they did is to be blindly guessed rather than understood.

There are two very good original scenes: Amy's speech about marriage and Jo's negotiation at the end (the parallel between the author and the book heroin). Though not in the original story, those scenes added to character motivation very effectively and made them appealing to modern sensibilities.

To sum up, the film isn't so bad that I regret watching it on a boring week night, but I'd have been frustrated if I had gone out to watch it in the movie theater as soon as it was released."

So it is with director Greta Gerwig's new film adaptation of the classic novel ""Little Women,"" a self-congratulatory offering that might look nice but rings inauthentic and tedious in many regards. This is particularly true for its almost-laughable screenplay, whose contemporary dialogue doesn't even begin to adequately suit the film's 19th Century setting. The nonlinear storytelling approach often doesn't work, either, given that there are few recognizable distinctions to separate different time frames from one another. And, while many of the portrayals are solid -- Florence Pugh, Laura Dern, Timothee Chalamet and Meryl Streep -- one can't help but cringe at the overwrought, award-baiting performance of Saoirse Ronan, whose mugging for the camera becomes tiresome quickly.

Based on Louisa Mae Alcott’s novel the film does an injustice to the audience to which it is being  exhibited. The large sums the producers spent on promoting the film would have been better utilized in the hiring of a strong editor and an additional writer for the movie is in dire need of a better script and better editing. The scenes depicting the characters and the years in which the events in their lives take place go back and forth so many times that the viewer has to rely upon the hairdos of the sisters in order to try to determine the proper chronology. Casting here is also subject to criticism since Bob Odenkirk (“Better Call Saul”) does not fit the image of the father of the girls nor does Chris Cooper (with enough makeup on to make a teenager look like Methusaleh)  make a credible elderly neighbor. Both roles would have been better played by lesser known actors with no prominent identification problems.
I give the film a 5.0 rating with a special reward to the Public Relations person since he or she did a better job of hyping the film than did its writer-director in making it."

Subjective or objective, but I find quite interesting the positive response the second feature film by Greta Gerwig has received, considering the so self-complacent film she created.
I personally believe that.

Do not confuse that feeling with me saying this is a misdone film. There's talent in her direction but Gerwig instead of looking for a challenge having the doors as open as she has them at the moment, she sat in the conformism and made a film that feels totally built as a ''For Your Consideration '' And be afraid if she's not considered.

I don't deny that Gerwig loves the novel, she shows it and certainly this version is her personal vision but despite the nice attempt, there's nothing new or fresh in her take.
I have to admit and emphasize that at this point it's completely stupid and naive to ask for a radical change in a story which has already been told a lot of times in film, however, it also cannot help feeling like a cheap mean of exploiting the story considering our current times, where feminism is now a driving force in the industry.
Like I said, she went for the safe bet.

And yet despite Gerwig's attempt to increase that specific plot weight, she also avoids going to issues that wouldn't work for the story she was trying to tell, because although they're not girls with money, they have the privilege of being protected from the civil war.

Jo is a young woman aware of herself and her mind, which in those times wasn't something positive but obviously the external world is not a concern for her, only her personal interests. And that's ok, we get to be that way, especially when we're young, but how do you try to make woke characters, if it's only in the things that suits them?
That's where the pertinent questions should be asked about what it was decided to take in order to make this new version work according to the director's perspective.

In the end, despite the production quality, Little Women is just a conventional and ordinary repetition of a literary classic that I personally think has already been too used.
But the proposal works both to be loved and to be hated and that depends a lot on the mentality you carry with you when you go to see it.
As always the rest depends on what you get from the film."

Given unlimited access to the Imperial War Museum's film archives and the BBC's old catalog of audio interviews with veterans, Jackson has pieced together a rather thorough inside look at the entire experience. From the enthusiasm of doing one's service for the country (a lure which drew mere children, some as young as fifteen, to lie about their age in search **** adventure) to the grim, futile reality of a charge across no man's land, it pulls no punches and shows us the bare reality of that first great war.

The footage itself, largely unseen and almost unanimously up-close and personal with the troops, has been steadied, adjusted to play at a consistent speed and carefully colorized, resulting in picture quality that's unusually vivid and accessible. It's easy to lose touch with something that's juddering and grainy, cast in a permanent sepia tone, but in living color these kids might as well be our neighbors. Some scenes translate better than others, but at worst it merely looks like a heavy-handed technicolor job. The standout moments for me came from our private tour of the artillery cannons, so intense and powerful that they nearly shake the television itself.

The ground-focused narrative limits our perspective, though, with scarce mention of where we are or what we're trying to accomplish. That's probably a good example of how the troops themselves felt, but it betrays the sheer magnitude of the war effort and leads to a few vacant lulls in the narrative. Still, a laudable technical accomplishment and an impressive archive **** that's no longer with us."

You're better off catching some colorized WWI TV docs on The History Channel.

This what-if-Queen-Anne’s-court-was-lesbian premise is historically off the wall, given that two of the protagonists, Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz) and Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) were historically documented to be extremely devoted to their husbands. The historical basis for the lesbian theme apparently harks back to some vindictive rumors that were circulated during Queen Anne’s reign (1702–1707 as Queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and then until 1714 as Queen of Great Britain and Ireland) by malicious and jealous courtiers. At Versailles such a scenario might have been plausible, but the stodgy, uptight English court of the eighteenth century? The French Catholic aristocracy felt they needed a priest only twice in their lives—when they married and when they died—but the English took the Anglican Church and the wages of sin very seriously. Since Henry VIII, the ruling monarch has been the head of the Church of England, and this kind of liberated behavior would have been severely repressed during this era.

So the film has to be accepted as a fantasy, and a wild, absurdist one at that. Billed as a comedy-drama, it’s not that humorous. I didn’t laugh once. The actors are consummate professionals, and the costumes and period sets are perfect; nevertheless, the film is wearisome. Dark hallways looming up at the camera and a preoccupation with a wide-angle lens distortion known as pincushioning (usually considered a photographic flaw but used in this film as a feature) are recurring stylistic devices. Colman’s acting in the role of Queen Anne is of the highest caliber, but she always has to act sick, moody, and on the verge of hysterics, so her character is also wearisome. Her Queen Anne seems to be quite stupid and unable to comprehend politics, economics, military strategy or anything that does not cater to her sexual needs and her personal vanity. Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are rivals for the Queen’s affections, and their characters display the worst kind of female wiles and weaknesses, stopping just short of hair-pulling and scratching each other’s eyes out. Scenes are introduced with text graphics that are random quotations, sometimes skewing the letters with arbitrary spacing. The film is artistically conceited. In the end, it does not produce the desired effect, which presumably is to depict the absurdist and existentialist view that there is no intrinsic meaning in life. The musical score is as pretentious as the rest of it, vacillating between Baroque violins and a bizarre chiming sound that is supposed to set a mood but is instead unnerving and bewildering."
1633,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-favourite/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Popcorn55,"Jan 28, 2019",5,"Lost in a limbo somewhere between Masterpiece Theater and Monty Python, this artsy-fartsy cutesy-pootsy ""period drama"" is neither convincingly ""period"", nor very dramatic, nor does the occasional half-hearted comic scene redeem it.  A lot of work obviously went into this, and we have to respect the efforts of all involved but... it all turns out to be an odd and rather dreary affair that's more depressing than entertaining.

While there are many lingering close-ups of Emma Stone to show that her agent has negotiated a generous portion of exclusive screen time for her, the cinematography in general is notably annoying and distracting.  In particular the ""fisheye"" wide angle shots with peripheral curving and distortion of the images, help to destroy any immersive experience here, and distance us from the story.  A story which is often a bit hard to follow, and hard to swallow.  That most of the cast don't make any attempt at English accents, and talk essentially L.A. street talk, additionally sabotages the historical ambience we expect.  Maybe this was supposed to be campy, like it was in ""Marie Antoinette"", but it doesn't come across that way here.

Finally, the irritating score compounds the strange off-key quality of the film.  While some period music is used, it's performed and mixed in a way that sounds inauthentic.  Then we have long, long periods where the score is some kind of inexplicable, monotonous, modernistic knocking, tocking noise that again distracts us from the action at hand and reminds us that this is an artsy-fartsy director getting in his artsy farts instead of entertaining us.

The narrative is insipid and somewhat uninspired. The humor is weak. Something incredible coming from Lanthimos because even in the darkness of The Killing of a Sacred Deer you could notice all the nuances. Here it's not very functional and to some degree disappointing.

It's a parody and a farce that fails at important moments and despite my high expectations and how much I expected this film and how much I expected to love it, the truth is that I ended up bitterly disenchanted, disappointed and dissatisfied."
1638,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-favourite/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,MarkHReviews,"Dec 24, 2018",6,"I went to the screening of “The Favourite” wanting and expecting to love it.  I just can’t.  There’s a lot to like about this film – the cast and the dialogue are fabulous.  And while the crackling dialogue portrayed in the film’s trailer is delivered fully throughout the film, be aware that this is no comedy.  In fact, the theme being developed by Director Yorgos Lanthimos is just too bleak for many moviegoers and most human beings.  “The Favourite” advances the thesis that all humans are venal, petty and self-absorbed.  Genuine kindness is rare.  Expecting people to help others, absent some sort of self-interest, is a fool’s errand.  The film doesn’t just posit that people’s negative traits tend to overwhelm their better instincts; it advances the premise that we live in a world devoid of genuine goodness.  It’s all a little hard to bear.  However, “The Favourite” is clearly the most accessible and upbeat of Lanthimos’ recent films.  In “The Lobster” (2015), single people are required to spend time at The Hotel, where they must either find a compatible mate within 45 days or be transformed into the animal of their choosing. His 2017 film “The Killing of the Sacred Deer” had some critics believing the film was a masterful meditation on cruelty, while others described the film itself as cruel.

“The Favourite” centers on the reign of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), who ascended the British throne in 1702.  In no small part because she knows frighteningly little about affairs of state, Anne is strongly influenced by Lady Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), Duchess of Marlborough.  Churchill gives her cousin, Abigail Masham (Emma Stone), a menial job in the royal household after Abigail’s family has fallen from grace.  Only too late does Sarah recognize that Abigail is a more-than-worthy rival for the queen’s affections.   While the film is hard to bear, it’s not hard to watch.  Colman, Weisz (both alumnae of “The Lobster”) and Stone are at the top of their games, making the viewing experience completely worthwhile, even while the film feels confusing in a few places, soul-crushing in several.  For American audiences, Colman is a punch line – in the best possible sense: she has spent many years becoming an overnight sensation.  Known in the UK primarily for her TV work, Colman has a long string of impressive credentials, most recently in “The Night Manager” (2016), a quirky stepmother in Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s TV adaptation of “Fleabag” (2016) and a sublime performance in “Broadchurch” (2013-2017).  In the UK, Colman is so ubiquitous she even appears in the current British Airways safety video.  Weisz and Stone have both generated awards buzz of their own, but this is Colman’s show.  She demands full attention despite portraying a character prone to self-pity and cloying neediness who is completely out of her element when it comes to behaving like a responsible head of state.  (If her face were orange, viewers might see an analogy in contemporary events.)

“The Favourite” is least effective as a narrative to be taken literally, much more worthwhile as a meditation on the human condition that encourages debate and self-reflection.  This film is powerful, necessary and important; it’s just not a lot of fun along the way."

Being a big fan of his most recent previous films (The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer), I was really looking forward to this one. Set in early 1700s England, it follows Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) and two young women (Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz) vying for her admiration and attention as her servants, all in the midst of a war with France. Like I said, the film is very absurdist in nature, and is infused with plenty of deadpan and dark humor, which kept the film interesting and amusing enough at times. In addition, Colman, Stone, and Weisz were all brilliant and spot-on, their performances fitting and adapting to the film's absurdism quite well. Naturally, with its period setting, it was also a very aesthetically pleasing film to watch as well, with lavish production design, costumes, etc. On the flip side, unfortunately, while the film started out so promising, lively, and energetic in the first half, much like a major character that suffers a stroke in the second half, the film began to really slow down and drag, losing much sense of direction, and feeling rather aimless the more it progressed. Overall, aside from a witty (but also cringy at times) screenplay full of dialogue that's somehow humorous and shocking all at once often times, striking performances from the cast, and incredibly detailed production values, I found the film to be rather weak and half-baked in terms of story. Very promising and amusing first half, but a very slack, underwhelming, and disappointing second half that left much to be desired for me."

The first 45 minutes are moderately delightful and quaint, but the dip in entertainment value within the second act was almost insurmountable for me. Maybe Yamagata's countryside really is tranquil enough to lull someone to sleep? Or perhaps it's the long, drawn-out conversations on agriculture that do the trick.

First off, Mad Max is a mute passenger in his own film, for a good part of it. That just isn't what I go to see a Mad Max film for. Then it's the baddies. They're simply not all that bad. The look and act menacing, but it's not backed up by deeds, so it is difficult to see them as truly frightening. The idea to give ideology to the lesser minions, to humanise them, is pretty pointless and ultimately distracting. Am I supposed to hate and fear these people or have a special place in my heart for them? It just doesn't work. When we run into Hell's Grannies (tm) toward the end of the film, it just stretches credibility. It's just not what you would find in a post-apocalyptic world. Once again, talk and bravado and no action to back it up, on top of the lack of credibility. Then the ending, which I won't spoil. Why? Why them? Why are they the ones? It makes no sense. Then the final problem I mention, there is the problem of motivation for the female hero (and Max for that matter). Why is she doing what she is doing? She has no stake in it as can be seen. In a world like this, for someone to stick their neck out purely to help others lacks credibility. In Mad Max 2 for example, the selfish motives of Max are painstakingly established. Take note, filmmakers. There are other minor problems: wasting ammunition with machine guns. MM2 clearly establishes that there are guns around, but ammunition is very hard to come by.

Mad Max: Fury Road

Miller has taken things too far even for this franchise. Are we supposed to chug it all up? As much as passionate and meticulously driven this post apocalyptic world is, I would like to think that the genre sci-fi; which so it blatantly claims to be, is either misinterpreted or taken for granted in here. This film is far from being thought provoking. This raw ruffian ideology that George Miller; the writer-director, thrives upon, is more admirable than overwhelming. His utter fierceful confident in his vision is frankly dangerous. To pull off such a heist- if I could call it- at this scale is purely inspirational.

It is so bizarrely grand that the narration or characters or even the cinema itself gets lost into the dust. Aforementioned, it can be difficult for some viewers to swallow in this whole tale, swirling around in a pathos unapologetic world, there is barely any host for us to root for. And this very three dimensional take is what helps the cast to portray a fluid creamy persona in this bumpy road. Charlize Theron as the most lethal and convincing among all, is more than a match for Tom Hardy's ""one instinct-ish"" iconic character Max.

In fact, if anything, Hardy has to try hard, even snatch a gun in order to helm charge on her, a fatal attempt as Theron refuses to share the steely cold looks with anyone on screen. Another fascinating factor is the supporting characters and how invested they are in telling this story, crossing boundaries and showcasing a feat of bravery and commitment, this ensemble of cast defines the term ""teamwork"" to a whole new level. Mad Max: Fury Road iterates the theme of the world in its long action sequences, a game of chess, not the sacrifice or the head scratching tricks of it, but a succession of winning attempts."

The plot is meaningless, simple and at one point becomes incoherent; the worst thing is that George Miller tries to hide it with an opulent artillery of explosions. It’s true that action cinema is all about that, but what makes an action movie stand out from the rest is the thing that sustains the significance of the explosions and fights.

His vision is twisted, violent, and at times quite humorous. It's a very stylistic film. Unfortunately I couldn't find too much substance backing it up.

The story and characters are rather shallow. Both just serve as vehicle for the action while giving us something and some people to root for. That's wouldn't really be too much of a bad thing had it delivered a little bit more in that department. Miller certainly does has a particular flair to his action scenes, but they are far from the mind-blowing spectacles so many would have us believe. What we get here is mildly entertaining at best.

The world this movie inhabits has a certain hideous beauty to it. It's just a shame it isn't filled with much compelling content. Performances are solid, but these actors aren't playing fleshed out characters and they aren't really given much to say. The story is a simple set up for big action-packed spectacle that never arrives. What we get is a mildly entertaining but ultimately disappointing action flick that doesn't deliver much. It's a case of a lot of flash and not much bang. It's not as ""mad"" as we were led to believe."

I really wish this chase scene could be two hours long!' If so, Mad Max: Fury Road is your kind of movie. If you feel that character, plot, and emotional resonance are for sissies, then this is also a movie tailor-made for your tastes. If the thought of Michael Bay directing a mashup of Fast & Furious/Waterworld makes your sphincter tighten in anticipation, then you, my friend, have found home.

Despite some pretty impressively imagined nonsensical post-apocalyptic evil (women being milked for sustenance, breeding harems, deformed peasants withering away in the desert) and ridiculous metalhead spank bank fantasies (flamethrower guitar mutant strapped to amps strapped to a car, I'm lookin' at you) this movie is pretty uninspired.

It does, however, have fantastic camera work in some places. Certain shots are beautifully composed, ranging from ""hey that was neat,"" to ""oh wow."" There is a certain black/white purple/blue night scene that is particularly beautiful. But it isn't enough to save this wreck of a movie. It gets a 5 for me because of the visual aesthetic, which would have earned a 10 if they had tried to put just a little bit of meat on the bone they dangled in front of us."

How dismal are movie goers of today to rate this so highly? Im seeing crazy terms like Movie of the year. Im reading perfect reviews scores from so many critics that I wonder A) How do you get a job? B) Who are you writing for? The reader or the studios C) Are you giving it higher scores bcos you want to see more of the rebooted franchise? Clearly there is money involved. This looks good on screen, its Max, it has George Millers style dripping throughout, but all said and done its not a great movie. I was excited, the early screenings were received with applause, so impressed were the studios they gave Miller $14mill to go back add more explosions, more stunts..What Rubbish!! they were given $14million to buy the reviews of critics to cover over the complete lack of storyline, plot or character development. Make no mistake, this is marketing branding vehicle, like Hunger Games, totally purchased reviews. A pay day movie to the media sites and reviewers. They know this, play ball, perpetrate the myth. Charlise is there cos Max is wooden, maybe if he actually displayed some MAD qualities. His instincts, his battle with the crazies out there that took killed his family, the road warrior surviving the highways in his V8 Interceptor. No instead they blow up it in first 5mins of movie so he can travel on the venga bus/truck whatever. There is very little buy in, you dont feel the drama, the tension cos you know the result. It just tries to fill that 2hrs with distractions and stunts of crazies biting the dust that you care little **** the shallow surfaceness thats the problem. Theres no twists, no surprises, and lacks the characters of the original, or the comraderie of Max & Gyro Capt found in Mad Max 2. The crazies have about as much menace as Thunderdome. I saw Mad Max 2 with my brother 30yrs ago we came out of that movie amped. That was a classic. Max motivations were real. The threat was real, so then the drama was real, you bought into who would live and die. When Hollywood gonna learn? Charlize Theron is too well known, so theres never any threat to her. You know she will be there as will Max at the end of the movie. This ranks 3rd of the Max franchise, as nothings as bad as Thunderdome, however its still completely mindless and missing the soul of the first two. The reviews above 70 are generous, those in 80s need to get real.. The 90 to 100 scores hahaha you have been bought!! This is not a masterpiece. Do your bloodyy job. Sorry George Miller as an Aussie I want you to successfully reboot Max, but not like this. Make a quality Max, your last 2 efforts are diminishing the franchise. Its becoming a joke."

Will those reviewers still think Fury road is any good by next week when they've forgotten this movie and woken up to reality?

What a disappointment!! George Miller how could you have come up with a movie this bad? Ok Max got away with just 17 lines in MM2 but the movie had earth and substance! Tom Hardy reduces Max to a boring mute idiot, sidelined by Charlize Theron who usually does ok in movies. Not this one unfortunately. The bad guys in MM1 and MM2 were real characters and real people. Everyone in the film had a purpose, a reason to be. No one in this film is connected to any part of anything. Its a totally disconnected silly stage act that insults the viewer on a number of levels  .
As for  the vehicles- ok  its better than nothing ( thunderdome) but they are foolish, unreal, disneyesque, and absurd - almost like trying to impress an adult with a transformer toy. They wouldn't last a day in a real apocalyptic landscape, prompting too many questions like why and how?
The plot  -They go somewhere and turn around and go back again. Driving miss daisy with a bit more horsepower, but less storyline. And a few cirque de soleil clowns thrown in who do some zany acrobatics.""oooh I heard the stunts were real and not cgi""
What character development ? Zilch! why were the baddies so bad? I don't know or really care. They certainly aren't real or menacing like the humungous. They don't create an iota of tension or a modicum of memorability
This movie is the diametric opposite to its  relatively austere Aussie dirt outback heritage, which is replaced by fake yellow fantasy sandstorms direct from the mummy returns -   Why were they driving in there again? Don't ask yourself these questions as there are no reasons for anything in Fury Road.

The feminism is a contrived twist that does nothing to improve the film, as no characters are developed male or female.

If you can ignore the lack of acting, plot or story, what is left is 2 hours of whacky silly nonsense and pointless races/pyro/ explosions. . Unlike the previous films fury road is a hollow movie that betrays its genuine fan base and treats the rest of the audience like  a bunch of morons with A.D.D.

This 2-hour film spends its entirety in a claustrophobic room during a 5-year series of hearings. It does offer some fascinating and frustrating insights into the culture and the directors have infused it with a stark artistic approach. However, your patience is also on trial: not only because the proceedings are so exasperating, but because the endless inflexible dialogue is, well, endless. If you have the patience to endure the droning tedium and a taste for austere foreign films, it might be worth a viewing. In Hebrew and French with subtitles."

The divorce decree is only obtainable in Israel from a rabbinical court.  In a so called ‘modern’ democratic country it may surprise many that in a marriage a woman has no equality.

“Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem”, the Israel nominated Oscar contender for Best Foreign Film, is the third, and a stand alone, in a trilogy of this couple. This is a trial with  Vivianne as the only woman, her lawyer, her husband and his lawyer who happens to be his brother and the three rabbi judges.  Over a period of 5 years we follow her fight for that important piece of paper for her to get on with her life.

As the trial progresses, or doesn’t, we learn about the wife Viviane and husband Elisha, their 4 children, their marriage and why she wants a divorce and he won’t give her one. It isn’t until the middle of the movie that her sister and sister-in-law are presented bringing some fireworks to the screen which takes place mainly in a square windowless room with two tables, 4 chairs and the rabbis raised up on a dais, with another table brought in for the witnesses.

“Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem” was written and directed by the sister and brother team Ronit and Shlomi Elkabetz with Ronit playing Viviane and Shlomi, her husband Elisha. With the exception of 2 impressive outbursts Ronit holds the screen with her very expressive face while Shlomi has a quiet power as he tries to explain himself. Both Menashe Noy, as her lawyer, and Sasson Gabay, as his, support the two impressively.

“Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem” tackles an intriguing subject that not many people know about but moves too slowly to be as effective as it could and should be."

1701,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/phantom-thread/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,drqshadow,"Sep 20, 2024",6,"Paul Thomas Anderson's latest is more in the vein of There Will Be Blood than Magnolia or Boogie Nights, meaning it's tighly focused on a very small, richly-developed cast rather than a glut of competing, interwoven storylines. Really, there are only three characters who matter: an intense, controlling dress-maker (Daniel Day-Lewis), his steady, all-business sister (Lesley Manville) and his young, headstrong new muse (Vicky Krieps). Their relationship is complicated, a careful balance of tics, emotions and triggers that frequently threatens to collapse, but somehow manages to remain upright. They badger and provoke each other, testing for weakness between fleeting moments of warmth and compassion, and this flood of dense, competing emotion fuels their creative output.

Like many of Anderson's other films, Phantom Thread is quite slow, lazily coasting through snippets and snapshots of the trio's various liaisons - sibling, professional and romantic - and doesn't always settle on a firm message or meaning. We're merely documenting a small tangle of lives, complete with unsightly quirks and personality-driven hardships, as they learn to coexist and endure/accept one another's shortcomings. It's a film I enjoyed more upon reflection, thinking over the various layers of subtext and character motivation, than I did while I was watching it."

All the while, I was thinking, ""The critics are going to swoon over this self-consciously artsy-fartsy filmmaking bilge.""  The story features fictional people almost as personally dysfunctional as many film critics are in real life, and the movie has all of the pretentious high-art characteristics that fascinate filmmaking students in art colleges but are lost on normal moviegoers who are simply seeking an evening of pleasant entertainment.  ""Phantom Thread"" evokes from viewers the same obligatory reaction a premiere performance of a commissioned work draws from a classical music audience on which it is inflicted: sufficient applause to avoid accusations of cretinism for failing to appreciate the finer things of life, accompanied by internal thanksgiving that it's over and that the long suffering audience will never have to experience it again."

It’s understandable; I particularly found it hard to care about the bond between the main couple in Anderson’s newest project, Phantom Thread. Though one can still greatly appreciate the artistry created here to depict desire above devotion beneath fashion’s puppet strings.

Several scenes express the same meticulous directorial attention of stitching a hem, so much so that even a mundane scene such as spreading butter on toast stresses the senses. Anderson’s vigilant craft demonstrates the sly nature of his first-hand man, Daniel-Day Lewis, through the quietest actions. Day-Lewis’s seamstress role feels he never was meant to marry, perhaps influenced by London’s fashion scene, although his inner conviction seems challenged once the dialogue between his new concubine arouses a need to restrict another's lust.

The visual cues suggest the look of a live stark-white studio photoshoot under diffused harsh lights to evoke heated passion, a sensation mellowed out by a gentle, warm fireplace glow until the cold breakfast table counteracts the calmness. Soon later into the runtime, snow graces its presence, completing the emotional glide along the film’s distressed ribbon. The supposed visual flaws in the ugly wallpaper heightened by the high ISO setting simply add to the visual flavor, making the whole sum of its parts reflect the era.

Again, the fashions really tell the story; the costumes designed by Mark Bridges (The Artist, Inherent Vice) rock to the wind of the citizens’ visualized longings, the wardrobes’ shapes and tones either emphasizing the female form for lust or simplifying the appearance for true love.

Beyond the visual elements, the musical score by Jonny Greenwood (Inherent Vice, There Will be Blood) orchestrates the beauty of the piano and the haunt of the strings to anticipate danger in the room based on the level of voluptuous nature. It almost seems like the crypt threaded Greenwood’s tones to trigger your own cravings by ringing your ears until they turn a deep crimson hue.

Each character’s realized past comes from whatever they could or could not control including the seamstress’s new concubine, who is introduced by saying she gave every piece of herself as he forced her to work on only four hours of sleep. Meanwhile, the seamstress’s house servant, played by one of this year’s Oscar nominees, Lesley Manville, sustains a delicate eye to keep our attention toward the subjects of managed focus in the home.

However, one critical problem damages the overall production: it seldom comments on present day issues, instead exploiting the time to show off pretty European clothes. The full reality of **** men at the time gets the boot, both in comparing it to the women they took advantage of alongside how it links back with today.

Phantom Thread thus should be expected to fall out of public memory because it uses an autocratic political stand in service of the Oscars it thinks it deserves. Forget aiming to please multiple generations with a compassionate story anyone can see themselves in, it only has its sights on the temporary 90th Annual Academy Awards with its all-White setup in mind, since Paul Thomas Anderson clearly knows deep down that the voters fancy prestigious British motion pictures.

Consequently, Phantom Thread romanticizes two selfish leads, turning out an orgasmic experience rather than a compassionate one. So, in regard to the Weinstein scandals plaguing Hollywood right now, Phantom Thread does more harm than good. Think back to Fifty Shades of Grey, the unhealthy relationship depicted in Phantom Thread perfectly recreates those torturous sex games, except in a classier fashion. Why then exactly did this score a Best Picture nomination while James Franco, a recent actor accused of sexual misconduct, got snubbed a nomination? It makes no sense.

Hopefully, after time dissipates, one can enjoy Phantom Thread’s artistry. Hopefully, after a decade or two, this movie won’t scream, “Oscar-bait,” but be appreciated for how the well-staged tension gives a strong sample of the direction from the brilliant Mr. Paul Thomas Anderson."

The film is at times a great film, at times instead a mere exercise in style by the director Pawlikowski.

1715,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cold-war/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,MarkHReviews,"Sep 4, 2019",5,"For the average moviegoer, “Cold War” involves heavy lifting under the best of circumstances.  It’s shot in black-and-white in Polish with English subtitles.

The film begins in 1949, when Wiktor (Tomasz Kot) and a colleague are traveling around Poland collecting reel-to-reel recordings of indigenous folk songs.  Eventually, they develop a state-sponsored program that celebrates Polish culture while eventually genuflecting toward Stalin and Poland’s other oppressors and cold war allies.  Along the way, Wiktor selects Zula (Joanna Kulig) as a member of the troupe and, eventually, his lover.  After Wiktor defects on a trip to Berlin, they reconnect only to separate in various venues from Yugoslavia to Paris.  When Zula decides to flee Paris and return to Poland, Wiktor is willing to go to prison in Poland if he can eventually be by her side.  The movie spans the period from 1949 to the mid-1960s.

At its best, this film is stark, yet emotionally rich.  In the lead role, Joanna Kulig is riveting.  She flourishes in a role written specifically for her by Writer/Director Pawel Pawlikowski.  She received the Best Actress award at this year’s European Film Awards.  In addition to her impressive acting skills, Kulig also is an accomplished singer, performing folk songs and jazz numbers persuasively.  Although his role is more subdued, Kot burns with equal intensity.  Together, you can’t keep your eyes off this star-crossed couple.  But the whole process is maddening, as the viewer observes, repeatedly, the herculean efforts each will make to be with the other, only to be forced to watch the relationship disintegrate as soon as they are reunited.

Pawlikowski’s script is simply a hot mess.  At some points, he seems to be offering a critique of communism and the Eastern Bloc, as the film’s title suggests.  At other points, he may be making an existential statement.  He also seems to propose that tumult and overt hostility are inevitable in any profound relationship.  He gives a glancing blow to the idea that to be human is to be at war with oneself.  The overall thesis, apparently, is that life itself is eventually unbearable.  This muddle of ideas is perhaps better understood when one realizes that the story is based on the relationship of Pawlikowski’s parents.  When they met, she was a ballerina and he a medical student.  Throughout their lives, they apparently had a tortured relationship just substantial enough to make the other partner an indispensable antagonist.

The muddled plot makes more pronounced the questionable circumstances under which the primary characters begin their relationship.  Wiktor is the conductor and developer of the folk performance.  Zula is an interchangeable part in the show.  He plucks her out of oblivion at the outset.  Given the imbalance of power between the two, it would have been helpful to underline Zula’s willing initial participation, eliminating any impression that she was manipulated or coerced.

As a non-professional filmgoer, I fail to understand why this film has received such acclaim.  (It is Poland’s entry at this year’s Oscars.  Pawlikowski is nominated for an Oscar for Best Director.)  It’s true that the black-and-white imagery is sometimes stunningly memorable and that the performances of Kulig and Kot are exceptional.  Unfortunately, ultimately, “Cold War” is eighty-nine minutes in search of a purpose."

This movie follows them as they re-connect every few years thru Europe's Cold War. Their erratic relationship involves more discord then heartfelt emotion, but they keep being drawn back together. Director Pawel Pawlikowski's previous film Ida also featured black and white cinematography and a deliberate pace (my review). Both were nominated for Foreign Film Oscars. This one features numerous musical performances that add some life to the otherwise slow-moving, minimalistic narrative. If you're into the artistry of foreign filmmakers, this will likely appeal, esp. for the visual style and interesting music. In Polish with subtitles."

The title of the movie ""Cold War"" can refer to the time period the story takes place or the romance, or lack of chemistry between the two leads, or possible the photography of this black and white film.

We follow Wiktor (Thomas Kot) and Zula (Joanna Kulig) from the beginning of their romance when they meet in Poland where he an accomplished musician, conductor and producer, with his current lover and co-producer, Irena (Agata Kulesza) are auditioning singers and dancers for players in the Mazurek Ensemble which revolve around Polish countryside folk music. Wiktor and Zula fall in love though really not suited for each other and, many times, make selfish decisions that keep them apart though the cold war also interferes with their journey. They never discuss their being unfaithful to each other and what it does to them over time including Zula. In the mix is Kaczmarek (Borys Szyc),  who was a driver for Wiktor and Irena and over the years has risen on the political scene.

A lot of the picture takes place in Paris, many scenes in a nightclub, Le Eclipse, and the soundtrack has music from Chopin to Billie Holiday to Bill Haley and the Comets.

The direction by Pawel Pawlikowski, along with cinematographer Lukas Zal, makes ""Cold War"" in the black and white 4:3 ratio photography look like paintings with each picture worthy of a museum showing. I was taken completely by surprise in the first scene a mirror was used as a background and having another scene with the screen filled with a field and 2 very small people looking like minatures in the lower corner was another wow moment.

Though Thomas Kot and Joanna Kulig didn't have any chemistry between them both present very striking figures, he with his imposing height and intense stare and she with  a persona that makes you concentrate on her whenever she is in the camera's eye. It did bother me that she resembles an actress that I just couldn't name!

Last week the movie received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film of 2018 and though it is interesting it is also disappointing mainly because the love story aspect just doesn't deliver. Was ""Cold War"" a metephor? A Simile? Or was the title a pun reflecting on the couple's love?

If you are looking for a beautiful, moving, involved love story ""Cold War"" is not for you but if you want to see a beautiful black and white photographed moving picture and, maybe, learning a little about the cold war and how it affected lives this is one for you!"

So perhaps my expectations were too high, especially given the reviews.  But this is what it came down to:  I just didn't care about the characters.  All the perfect cinematography - and stunning art direction on the whole - couldn't compensate for that.  I never expected to be bored, yet because I had never been drawn in emotionally, and because of a certain redundancy in the writing, I found it long at an hour and a half.

Also, I had to wonder why he didn't make more use of the ""cold war/Stalin"" etc. background.  I've seen political backdrops put to much better (and more profound) use recently in ""Roma"" and especially (on TV) ""Babylon Berlin.""  More character development - as in ""Ida"" - would have helped.  This seemed more like a dated stock film than one of the classic b&w's that show us more than passion and gazing.  (Lots of ""gaze"" here, including the director's!)   I had to wonder if the years' apart structure was a way to avoid anything resembling an examination of a passionate relationship over time."

Reading around some of the reviews of Zimna wojna [Cold War], I recognise that this should have been a film I liked, as so much of what critics are praising are exactly the kinds of things I myself often look for in a film. Indeed, I freely acknowledge there's a huge amount to praise here, with elements of the mise en scène borderline genius. However, all the aesthetic brilliance in the world doesn't hide what, for me, is its single greatest flaw - I just didn't care about the two main characters, and I didn't buy their relationship. I'm aware that emotional detachment is exactly what it was going for, and it's probably unfair to criticise a film for successfully doing what it intended to do, but when it ended, all I could think was ""meh."" Although, to be fair, that may say more about myself than the film.

Written by Paweł Pawlikowski, Janusz Głowacki, and Piotr Borkowski, and directed by Pawlikowski, the film begins in Poland in 1949, two years since a communist government came to power. Composer and pianist Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), his ethnomusicologist producer Irena (Agata Kulesza), and state-sponsored overseer Kaczmarek (Borys Szyc) are travelling through rural communities attempting to find recruits for a folk music school. Wiktor is bored out of his mind, until a young woman named Zula (Joanna Kulig) auditions. Although she doesn't fit the profile of what they are looking for, Wiktor argues that she has ""something different."" Soon enough, he and Zula are in a relationship. The rest of the film takes place over 20 years and four countries (Poland, France, Yugoslavia, and East Germany), but it never branches out from the central relationship.

To begin with some aspects which I liked. The film's aesthetic is absolutely unparalleled, as Pawlikowski and director of photography Łukasz Żal shoot in Academy ratio (1.37:1), which has the effect of confining the characters within the frame. The nature of the film lends itself to sweeping vistas and cityscapes captured in anamorphic (2.39:1), but, instead, Pawlikowski and Żal use the box-like nature of the Academy frame to trap the characters, who don't seem free even when standing in the vast open countryside.

Another example of the film's extraordinary mise en scène is the opening shot, where shallow focus creates a depth of field so small that the village behind the in-focus singers is completely flattened. This renders it visually inaccessible, and thus compels the audience to concentrate fully on the foreground singers. Compare this with the scene where Kaczmarek is giving a speech extolling the glory of the state, all the while a cow is wandering around in the mud behind him. The use of a deeper focus here means that the cow falls within the larger depth of field, and can be clearly seen, once again directing the audience's attention, only this time that attention is directed away from the foreground character as opposed towards him (an, of course, the cow is an important metaphorical element).

So, why did I not enjoy it? At the end of the day, this is a romance. But it doesn't work as a romance. Yes, it's not what you would call a standard romance by any means, the character motivations and justifications that you'd see in other narratives of this ilk are absent, and maybe because of that, although there was undeniable chemistry between the leads, I just didn't buy their insatiable desire for one another. The problem is, the same thing happens about five times - they meet, have a great time, argue over something, and one runs off. And even at only 85 minutes, this kind of structural repetition becomes, well, repetitive.

These are two people who have precious little respect for one another; beneath all the eroticism and physical attraction, they are simply two irreparably damaged people trying to save one another, living with a co-dependency, but instead hastening each other towards destruction. And as I couldn't buy into the believability of the romance, the entire enterprise floundered. And although the end is very well done, and the last line is spectacular, it left me unmoved, because, by that stage, I just didn't care. True, the structure of the film and the tight editing means that events in their lives are glanced at rather than lingered over, so the kind of nuances and character beats you'd expect are absent. By design, the film is barren and emotionally impenetrable, and in that sense, Pawlikowski seems to have been attempting to construct as detached a narrative as he possibly could. If anything, he succeeds too well."

In 2013, writer/director Lulu Wang received the news that her grandmother (“Nai Nai”) had terminal lung cancer and only a few months to live.  Her family made the decision not to tell Nai Nai, to save her from the mental anguish of a terminal diagnosis.  Instead, the family decided to create an excuse for gathering to say goodbye.  They determined that everyone would gather to celebrate the hastily-announced marriage of Wang’s cousin.

For a considerable period of time, Wang pitched her story to producers in both China and the US.  All wanted major compromises (Wang’s character should be the bride to add to the drama; unsettling images of “My Big Fat Chinese Wedding” come to mind) that would only distract from Wang’s main story.  Eventually, Wang found funding and made the movie she’d wanted to make.

Most of the film was shot over twenty-four days in Changchun, China, in the actual neighborhood of Wang’s grandmother.  To add authenticity, these scenes were filmed in Chinese; as a result, 75% of this film is in Mandarin, with English subtitles.

Awkwafina (“Crazy Rich Asians,” “Oceans Eight,” or, for YouTube enthusiasts “My Vag”) is the only actor in the film potentially well-known to American audiences.  At every point, Wang chose authenticity over star power.  She even cast her own great-aunt to play her grandmother’s sister.

It would be gratifying to report that Wang’s perseverance, thoughtfulness and creative integrity have resulted in an exciting, memorable movie experience.  In my opinion that just isn’t the case, although this film was one of the darlings of this year’s Sundance festival.  While there is the clear opportunity to confront a major existential question – “Do I want to know if I’m about to die?” – Wang’s script gives the topic scant attention.  She focuses instead on the issue of lying to someone you deeply love, but seems equally conflicted and ambivalent on this topic.

Most of all, this film offers little or no real character development.  While we’re told that Wang’s character spent several years of her childhood in Nai Nai’s care, there’s no deep exploration of the nature or depth of their relationship.  At the end of “The Farewell,” we know very little more about these characters and what animates them than we did when the story began.  That said, the restraint, insightfulness and fundamental kindness that animate the film announce Wang as a writer/director worth following.  Unfortunately, “The Farewell” is an opportunity missed."

Upon finding him he doesn’t recognize her and tries to get her involved with a get rich scheme by having her impersonate his late wife so he can get her inheritance that was left by her relatives who died in the war.

“As Time Goes By” is an important part of “Casablanca” as are “Again” in “Road House” and “Que Sera, Sera” in “The Man Who Knew Too Much” and this movie too has a song that becomes an important part of the story, by Kurt Weill and Ogden Nash, called “Speak Low” which is heard throughout the film and impacts the ending.

Nina Hoss, as Nelly, may not have the sexuality of a Lana Turner, and is a beauty in her own right, but she is the equal of Barbara Stanwyck in the acting department. She can and does say a lot with a look, her eyes through bad or good and the way she holds herself. You watch her progression from a scared, downtrodden woman to the beautiful, confident woman she was before the war. Ronald Zehrfeld, as her husband Johnny, who thinks that she can pass for his wife that could help him put his scam over has doubts about who she really may be but not enough to stop him. Zehrfeld has a romantic innocence that makes him seem less the villain than he is.

Another major, but undeveloped, role is Nina Kunzendorf as Lene, who does a lot for Nelly but their relationship isn’t quite defined and is unceremoniously out of the film before the halfway mark.

I was told by Allen that the film was an analogy of Germany after the war but I will admit it went right over my head! It might account for why I didn’t like the film as much as I expected to but it did introduce me to Hoss, Zehrfeld and Petzold enough for me to want to see the previous films they have made together.

“Phoenix” is a German film with (some poor such as ‘sit up‘ instead of ‘sit down‘) subtitles running 98 minutes."

The movie has a very nice sound track, cinematography is decent, performance is adequate.
But can a realistic movie be good if it's script does not make much sense? Even taken into account the possibility and probability of emotional distress leading to illogical actions, still it is difficult to understand main characters' behavior.
Times and times again I said to myself ""what?"" in disbelief.
Maybe the main idea was interesting but it was not well thought through and as a result looks and feels artificial. Overall I find the movie at best mediocre."

What a disappoint it is to report on PHOENIX. A metaphorical conception of a concentration camp survivor given a new face (literally) only to come back to Berlin to follow her husband, the man that betrayed her. PHOENIX is worthy of Sirk or Fassbinder. Petzold's direction is without merit and he gives one of our best actresses nothing to do. A total misfire that I found downright dull."

The stakes of the film seem constantly low, but it's because the film itself takes on the pace of the place. The characters, who were acted very well, are in a place of wandering and self-discovery, which perpetuates the slow-going film. The slow pace made me feel less for the characters. I understand why the movie is important now, but isn't making a choice and doing it even more important? I didn't think the film thought so. The script and acting was great, but I wonder if the direction could have been more precise. If you are an indie theatergoer, I'd recommend the film. This is one that just didn't resonate with me."

Its eclectic mix of content doesn't gel well, despite some of the material being exceedingly well done. It comes across mostly as an often-endearing, loving tribute, though it's frequently weighed down by far too much extraneous, incidental and, at times, repetitive material. Then there are the picture's fictional segments in which the director presents comically gruesome stagings of her father's demise (a la the macabre suicide sequences from Hal Ashby's ""Harold and Maude"" (1971)) as a means of coping with **** impending passage (most of which aren't especially inventive or funny). Taken together, this amalgamation of material just doesn't mesh and leaves viewers with a confusing portrait of what the filmmaker was attempting to accomplish. Perhaps recutting the footage would have helped, but, as it stands now, this one doesn't come through as it should."

Kaufman has worked this ground in the past, and, I think, more effectively, especially in ""Adaptation"" (2002).  The current film is interesting, and the use of animation helps convey the robotic nature of other humans in Michael’s world.  But for me, and for reasons I don’t fully understand, the film falls flat.  Too much ennui, maybe.  Or perhaps Michael is just too helpless to invite my empathy.  Or it could be that the various oddnesses of Michael’s world diverted too much of my attention from the central story line."

His latest (which he also co-directed) expands those boundaries again. It centers around an author who’s lost his inspiration in life. While visiting Cincinnati for a lecture, he meets a young woman who changes his outlook. Now the twist: Stage it in stop-motion animation using eerily human-looking felt puppets. Technically, it’s brilliantly realized and fascinating to watch, right down to the subtle facial expressions. As for entertainment value, it slows to tedium about half way thru. Just because it’s animated is no excuse for the self-indulgent pacing. This would have been a incredible short, but the conceptual gimmick can’t make up for the tedious length."

Evidently, as some of his previous works demonstrate, Kaufman has the capacity to write complex, emotionally moving films that explore the human condition and encourage the audience to reflect on life and what it means to be.

""Anomalisa"" is not one of them. This film feels so haphazard and disjointed; there's an utter lack of thematic cohesion and its attempts to provoke some kind of emotional response from the audience fall utterly flat. I can't remember the last time I've been so misled by a trailer; the clips and quotes you hear in the trailer are literally the best lines in the film, and within the larger context of ""Anomalisa"" itself, they lack any sort of punch. The universal voice idea is an interesting one, but it's used with limited effect in the film.

I won't deny that the film has some interesting things to say, but the way it presents these ideas is so poor and schizophrenic; they're just abruptly thrown into the dialogue in such an amateurish fashion. It's almost hard to believe this is the same mind behind films like ""Eternal Sunshine"" or ""Synecdoche"".

I simply can't recommend this film to anyone, even to fans of Kaufman's previous work. This is a movie that really could have benefited from a longer run-time, as it was sorely wanting for further character and general thematic development."

The attempt to make contact with an old flame seems like a promising plot twist, but it doesn't go anywhere."
1760,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/anomalisa/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Mike_M,"Jan 9, 2016",4,"This padded-out feature would have made a very good short.
There are good scenes, and ideas worth considering, but absolutely not enough of them for a feature.
The stop-motion and design are great, but it has problems on the story/art/intellect side because of stretching the run time past what the story/themes can bear.

Too many of the scenes (whether attempts at exploring the humdrum, or attempts at absurdist conflict) subtract more than they add to the whole. The main metaphor of a Fregoli delusion well-represents a kind of mid-life crisis, but it also loses quite a bit in flattening out the mid-life crisis into a general alienation (granted, with a mix of older existentialism issues, and newer ones such as 'personhood as illusory'). In a short film, this bare-bones metaphor would have enough of a poetic quality to work. But here, when the story is stretched out, we are constantly reminded of the lack of particulars. And at some point, not telling us more about the main character and his problems is just coy or frigid on Kaufman's part.

I should note that I have no problem with the main character being unsympathetic, nor the attempt at exploring the humdrum side of life in many scenes, nor the film's plot/conclusions being flat/troubling/puzzling, nor scenes that aren't always ""entertaining"". But those scenes have to do something besides show you that dull dialogue imitates dull talk in life. And if Kaufman was interested in tone/lyricism, theme, and irony OVER human particulars (and therefore other things that art can do), he was obliged to take careful, un-self-indulgent account of what the story could sustain. For the second film in a row, he hasn't.

I see why, on the the business side, this CAN'T be a $3M short when you can make a $10M feature instead. But this has no bearing on whether the feature has problems. And I understand why a lack of human particulars is fitting for puppets (and how from an ironic, existentialist and behaviorist point-of-view, we might be more puppets than we care to admit), but a few modern ideas don't automatically make 90 minutes worth of story."

It was too long for such a dull plot, the ending was predictable and i didn't feel anything relevant about the characters. You always expecting to see some twist, something more but ultimately it comes too short and the movie itself felt **** animation was excellent and i liked some aspects of Anomalisa but overall it's a complete waste of time and if you somehow want to get depressed, then i recommend you this movie."

The film is a message/theme first and a film second; the two main characters are entirely uninteresting, the plot moves slowly in the first half of the film, and the gratuitous sex and nudity is just creepy and adds minimal to the story. Charlie Kaufman shows his amazing skill as a writer and film philosopher with Anomalisa's deep themes and great art design, but shows his failure as a director as the film lacks an engaging plot, nor does it have interesting and relatable characters. I expected much better from Kaufman, and I hope he leaves the directing to others in the future."

Think again, it's not for everyone. Actually, it's almost for no one.
If you are familiar with David Lynch, just expect something similar. ""Mulholland Drive"" makes sense once you understand the core concept. ""Inland Empire"" does not make any sense whatsoever, it's just a sequence of oneiric sequences. ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" sits somewhere in between. There is some semblance of a story,  namely the search for a woman whom the protagonist loved years earlier, and some things even make some sense when put in the correct temporal sequence. Don't expect a conventional story anyway, the search is not as much for a physical woman as for an ideal that can never be found... or something. Dreams, reminiscences and maybe some real occurrences are indistinguishable (ok, I'd say that when the protagonist falls asleep in a cinema and wakes up in a mine, meeting a ghost shortly thereafter, it definitely does qualify as a dream).
Expect a lot of sequences that go nowhere, like a guy slowly eating an apple while crying. Scrap that, just expect the movie to go nowhere, you are in for the sequences. I guess to an artsy type, the aforementioned apple sequence could appear touching. Or the naked feet of a beautiful actress walking on a broken brick wall. Any number of dilapidated locales. The actor screwing a bulb into a lamp, in a flooded house. A house that is supposed to revolve if you pronounce the right incantation.
To me, it all looks like a dream where you are trying to do something but are constantly hindered and end up running in circles, there are few consistent rules and little to no sense in anything. Yes, I'll admit that the movie did manage to conjure some feeling now and then, hence the middling rating, but more than two hours lost in a dream is probably way too much for most people."

The many government worker type characters are somewhat comical but in a toned down sort of a way. The plot is pretty ludicrous but I found it really quite watchable and it was certainly entertaining regardless. Its fair to say that this is very much a political satire, one that features a lot of petty squabbling and I imagine it didn't go down well (plot wise) in certain parts of the world but thats easily guessed. I found the jerky/wobbly camerawork a bit frustrating and it relies on old stereotypes of the Russians, with scenes in a Siberian jail and so on. I like that its such an obvious send up of power and authority in such a powerful and feared part of the world. Its somehow amusing to see the 'powers that be' or those who worked for them, to be faced with having to create their new hierarchy, to see them struggle to build their future from whats left.

I should perhaps mention that there are some sex references and strong language present, plus mild to moderate violent scenes, hence the films 15 rating in the UK."

That being said, it does feature an amazing cast in very fitting roles - I have to give particular nods to Steve Buscemi, comedy legend Michael Palin and Jason Isaacs.

The comedy in this movie comes form the way how it essentially criticizes the Soviet Union by exaggerating things. It never goes too far though; there is a sense of realism present all the time. Some moments become very hilarious though, and all of the actors have great comedic timing. The story is paper thin but still manages to complicate things and, unfortunately, the steam runs out halfway through. After that you just sit there, waiting for it all to end."

I think perhaps I was hypnotized by the impression that something might be about to happen, but nothing ever did.  It just went on and on for a while and then it ended and what exactly it was, or meant to be, I really couldn't say. Was it comedy?  Was it satire?  I really just don't know.

Pretty soon it becomes evident that the makers sacrificed the story line to provide the audience with an over-dose of climax. The movie feels like an ingenious attempt at creating a film that relies on shocking the audience with over the top emotional conflicts that add nothing to the actual story, which feels to me as a response to our modern society with a lack of attention and a constant craving for stories of misery. It does succeed at delivering that, but in my opinion becomes overly contrived very fast."

Much of that failure is due to the fact that this is a movie that is burning with anger which causes the comedic bits to feel jarring.

The film presents an excellent performance by Sam Rockwell and some good from Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson (not enough for Oscar nominations). The script is very good, but it has a big flaw in the last 20 minutes that are totally rushed. Very little humor compared to the previous works of the director.

Great performance from Frances McDormand but I just started to lose compassion for her half way through when she continuously did spiteful and nasty things with no justification and absolutely no repercussions.  That coupled with the 1 dimensional rendering of the redneck racists and stupid cops just left a bad taste in the mouth. Also cheesy voiceovers from dead people... no thanks.

I think the deer scene was the moment for me when this one jumped the shark.  If you're going to have CGI in your movie, it better be absolutely flawless.  If it looks like a badly lit cut out or a glitchy render then you have **** the illusion of reality and every minor flaw becomes magnified in scrutiny."

The Coen Bros., Wes Anderson, David Lynch are all masters of the genre.  They make films that are quirky and yet somehow believable.  This film has moments that are so over the top they would never happen in real life.  For example, there is a scene where a teenager at a school throws a soda on the Frances McDormand character's car, and the way she handles it would never happen in real life, and there were no consequences for her actions.  In fact, she does several outrageous things without any consequences.  There are other unbelievable outrageous moments that I won't go into.  Other times the quirkiness works, so it's a mixed bag for me.  This movie is definitely not a visitor's guide for the state of Missouri as most of the town are portrayed as bigots, including the police force.  The acting was stellar throughout.

1804,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-star-is-born/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,ClariseSamuels,"Feb 17, 2019",4,"A Star Is Born never loses its appeal as the ultimate American rags-to-riches success story—with a love story to boot. First made in 1937 with actors Janet Gaynor and Fredric March, the film was remade in 1954 with Judy Garland and James Mason, then again in 1976 with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, and now we have the twenty-first century version with Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. The film’s hype and award-season nomination sweep is partly due to the impressive soundtrack of heartfelt songs sung with the powerful mezzo-soprano voice of Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, known popularly to most of us as Lady Gaga, who also co-wrote many of the songs.

To begin with, there are many surprises in this film: 1) The moving and emotionally fervent songs were sung live on the set by Gaga and Cooper; 2) it appears that Bradley Cooper could have been a rock star if he had not succeeded as an actor; and 3) Stefani Germanotta is a natural beauty who goes to great lengths to make herself look as bizarre as possible with her platinum hair and overly dramatic make-up in her persona as Lady Gaga. Strangely enough, Gaga said in an interview that she felt ugly looking like her real self in the role of Ally. There is also an autobiographical footnote in the film when Ally confesses that producers always told her they like the way she sounds but not the way she looks, which might explain Gaga’s decision in real life to make herself look as outrageous as possible. In the film, Ally says that producers complained about her nose, and in interviews Gaga admitted that this tidbit was from her real experience. (Ironically, Gaga’s patrician nose is quite elegant and reminiscent of ancient Roman aristocracy—there’s nothing wrong with her nose.)

The film begins strongly with a meeting of two musical minds—Ally lives at home with her dad, works as a waitress, and only gets to sing at night at a drag club where they tolerate that she is a real female because they like her. Cooper plays a famous country rock star, Jackson Maine, who is so famous that he could stumble drunkenly into any tiny bar in any city and instantly be recognized by every single person sitting there, which puts him in approximately the same league as Mick Jagger or Elton John. Cooper’s character is strikingly authentic as a musician and rock star, but Cooper’s dramatic skills are a bit rough and unpolished in this role, as are those of Lady Gaga. Gaga is playing her real self stripped naked, so to speak. She is unable to completely transcend her natural reticence about her real self to be convincing in the role of Ally. And Jackson Maine is supposed to be drunken, difficult, and debauched, with a perpetual chip on his shoulder; yet, he turns into a tender, docile lamb every time he looks lovingly at Ally. The viewer might wonder whether this is Jackson Maine, Ally’s lover, or Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga fan. The f-word dominates the script so unremittingly that at times it sounds like they are speaking an unfamiliar and deviant dialect of the English language.

The across-the-board award nominations for this film are a true testament to the impressively large fandom of Lady Gaga, making this film part of the popular culture that the Academy seeks to include in its nominations."
1805,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-star-is-born/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Slovenly_Muse,"Feb 9, 2019",6,"Competently directed, with superb acting and many stirring emotional moments, this film can't quite surpass its sense of being a vanity project for Bradley Cooper. It is much more tightly focused on Jack than Ally, to the point of nearly abandoning exploration of Ally's complicated feelings about her own rising **** midway, and ceding all points it almost makes about sexism and fame to the music industry, in order to get on with Jack's story. Unevenly paced, and with some dangling threads to pick up, the film was enjoyable, but ultimately lacked the courage to take its breakout song's promised dive into the deep end."

The script was lazy written. I don't understand all these hypes and positive reviews. It was Bradley Cooper and songs that kept me going till the end of the movie. I think it might be Cooper's best acting ever. On the other side, Lady Gaga was horrible. I mean it was totally fake. Her acting was bothering the **** out of me. If you guys wanna see a real ""A Star is Born"" movie, go watch Walk the Line starring Joaquin Phoenix. The crazy life of the great Johnny Cash."

It makes me angry that people enjoy this movie, and think that it has a touching story. The characters are selfish and shallow. And the fact that people think the ending is touching or sad is infuriating. Lady Gaga portrays a lovable character that remains insanely loyal to Bradley Cooper's. The puzzling thing is that throughout the film Bradley Cooper does nothing but bring her down. He does absolutely nothing redeemable the entire film. Sometimes films are about rehabilitating an old, washed-up soul. This movie wants to be that, but in the end Cooper decides to betray Gaga, the most supportive person in his life, and hold her back even more by heaping unnecessary grief onto her already stressful life. It isn't romantic or tragic, it is selfish. It solves none of the problems in either of their lives, and he only did it because he was a little bit sad. What a great message.

Despite the good performances in here by Gaga and Sam Elliot (Cooper is very one-note), and some good direction, the characters are atrocious. Don't believe the hype."

It's a testament to Lady Gaga's vitality and charisma that she makes Ally seem like a real person when, as written the character has motivations and desires which shift whatever way is most narratively convenient, but with zero logic or consistency.  First she's a ballsy performer at a drag club, fiercer than any Queen. Then she's a mousey never-was who doesn't believe in herself. She seems unaffected by Jackson's fame and taken with the man... But then  belts an original tune in a parking lot.  She's a passionate, authentic singer/songwriter who can only connect with her material when she's also playing the music herself... But then she's doing slick, choreography to a bland pop hit.  The biggest mystery of all is why she's with Jackson in the first place.  They don't have much chemistry beyond both being very good-looking. Clearly he can help her career, but there's no hint that she might be mercenary, so why is she with him? Especially after she instantly pegs him as a drunk.  I could go on, but am going to bail... just like I thought of walking out of the movie every 10 minutes or so after the first hour.  That said, the final song did make me cry–a real sign of Lady Gaga's talent as a performer, and a sign **** song."

It's full of cliches and by the book scenarios. Rushed beginning, naively developed and unconvincing plot (romantic comedies manner), forced and manipulative emotions and a lot of really unrealistic cringy moments (the whole grammy awards situation). The real star of the movie isn't Lady Gaga. Her character seems underdeveloped and her acting is very superficial. It really shows that she is at the beginning of her journey into acting - and I'm not convinced that she has what it takes to be an actor. After watching the film I have no idea who her character was. The girl was all over the place. The view on her career and music business was presented in such a shallow manner and again felt very unrealistic. The whole ""we are going to change you and make you a star"" felt like a short naive story from Britney Spears videos, and not like a plot from ""wanna be treated serious"" drama. What's funny is that the character's ""fake for the business persona"" is reminiscent of that of Lady Gaga. Only naive people would believe that her pop-star persona isn't created by the team of people and precisely designed for mass audience. So it's a bit funny to watch Lady Gaga playing a girl who had compromised her identity for a huge career in music business, when she's actually done that in real live. Of course she would deny that and said that her Lady Gaga persona is very personal, real and true - but it's not exactly the case. The real star here is Bradley Cooper. The problem is that his character is also a walking and breathing cliche. At least he was more convincing than Gaga. This movie falls into ""Dirty dancing"", ""The bodyguard"" (hit soundtracks/diva in the lead) etc. category. A B-movie loved by lots of people. I'm OK with that. It has a world-wide famous singer in the cast, and a directional debut of Bradley Cooper - of course critics will look somewhat favorably on it. But seriously the whole hype and oscar buzz is just so blown out of proportion of what this movie really is and what has managed to achieve. If this movie deserves to get any oscar recognition it should be for supporting role for Sam Elliot (he was the real real star and emotional blast in his tiny scenes) and for music. I would nominate the song which Gaga and Cooper sing together for the first time on stage. The last solo song was really disappointing and weak. It didn't have strong enough emotional struck despite the Gaga's impressive vocal abilities.
In conclusion. It's an OK movie. Too shallow, naive and emotionally manipulative to consider it - great drama. It's like Gaga's character from the movie, designed to appeal to the masses."

I found it flat, maudlin, boring in parts. The ending in this iteration of the story came across as unrealistic and untrue to the character. I didn't find Lady Gaga's performance at all compelling. The music wasn't anything special; certainly no song will end up being memorable, imo. There have been less worthy best picture winners, but this does not deserve Oscar glory.

It really needed some hummable songs and decent singers who had genuine star quality. Gaga oversinging like she was in a TV talent show didn't count. Cooper's numbers were drowned out by electric guitar riffs, covering up the thin lyrics and poor melodies. Unlike 'The Man Who Got Away', it's hard to imagine that songs like the aptly-named 'Shallow' will be remembered in 60 years' time. Other reviewers have pointed out the lack of chemistry between the leads and how the story fizzles out, making the title seem somewhat ironic. Cooper was unconvincing as an alcoholic, and Gaga was ok as the ingenue but didn't convince as a star, even though she is one in real life. The movie also seemed to mock her pop persona, as against the supposed authenticity of dreadful country songs or Adele-like ballads. Cheesy plot and terrible acting in fact reminded me more of Purple Rain, though at least that movie had some half-decent songs and musical performances."

But I will talk about what I saw and what I really think this film is and first of all I must mention that the hype in my opinion was excessive.

Bradley Cooper did good in his debut behind the scenes, but I don't think it's the wonder a lot of critics are saying it is. Regrettably, I think this film will actually get some nominations for the Academy Award and in my opinion it doesn't deserve them.

This remake is as basic as it is predictable and no matter that we are in a story updated to our times all its elements feel too predictable. Regardless of whether you've seen the remakes or not, if you've seen romantic films in your life you know where the story is going and that takes away much of its charm.

Cooper gives a sustained rhythm to the first hour. The music is pretty good, the concerts scenes are vibrant, everything unfolds in a pleasant, entertaining and interesting way but there comes a point where the rhythm begins to fall drastically and Cooper loses control of the story because when the drama and the emotional break arrives, he only stacks one event after another in order to provoke an emotional reaction from the viewers in order to prepare them for the final and huge dramatic point of the story.

Yes, there's quality, that I will not deny it, Cooper delivers a sincere performance although in points it's kinda cliche. Lady Gaga does the same because she starts well but when the moment comes she only becomes a more fictional version of her real life stage persona. No surprise on that side.

Bradley Cooper ends up offering a solid debut as a director but one too predictable and safe. It doesn't take any risk and everything walks from point A to point B by a very straight path and although functional, it doesn't offer anything new or refreshing."
1831,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-star-is-born/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Oct 5, 2018",6,"The first 3 productions of “A Star Is Born” revolved around the female star while the 2018 production is more about the male star which, to a certain degree makes it a vanity project since Bradley Cooper stars, coproduced, was one of the three who wrote the screenplay, also wrote a couple of the songs and directed the film. His makeup suntan and/or sunburn distracts in many scenes as he is the only one with that look. The camera is on him in many major scenes, many with Lady Gaga, taking away from other performers.

Cooper has made many changes with the most erroneous being the classic last line of the three other productions while the most interesting changes are the addition of a brother and a somewhat sleazy acting manager who takes over the star on the rise and turns her into something she isn’t.

On the other hand Cooper gives a strong performance and gives Lady Gaga a sensational movie debut. In the opening scenes we watch as Cooper gets to meet Lady Gaga as she does a rousing, sexy version of “La Vie En Rose” though not as strong as the meeting in the second movie version when James Mason meets Judy Garland in an afterhour’s jazz bar singing “The Man That Got Away” that defines her character. A definite contrast in the latter with Lady Gaga’s scene taking place in a drag bar!

We meet Lady Gaga’s father played by a subdued Andrew Dice Clay, her best friend played by Anthony Ramos, Sam Elliot as Cooper’s older brother and David Chappelle as his friend of many years all giving substantial performances.

Director Cooper handles the love story between him and Lady Gaga with help from the natural chemistry between them. He, also, delves into the masks that entertainers put forth when they become famous losing the real selves that made them famous and how it affects them.

The three remakes all have music that defines the singers and the eras in which the movies take place. In this version Lady Gaga, Lukas Nelson and Bradley Cooper have written most of the original songs either together or coupled and even solo. Of the 17 songs there are 5 duets by Lady Gaga, 3 solos by Cooper and 8 by Lady Gaga. Though many of the songs are already on their ways to be being hits I left the theatre not remembering one except the last and that is because of Lady Gaga’s performance.

As a novice director Cooper’s version runs a bit long at 2 hours and 15 minutes but overall his debut of this Hollywood often told story is quite good.

Having seen all 4 versions of “A Star Is Born” in my opinion the 1954 version, starring Judy Garland, in the uncut version is the best while this 2018 version has nothing to be ashamed of in its approach."

But as soon as she finds her success, it gets torpedoed.  I thought she'd turn into an Amy Winehouse kind of singer, but her eventual path is highly disappointing.

What about the challenges left to those who are needing to understand the other version?  Or even teach it?Even so, we can allow for art/ fantasy while also keeping history.  This production doesn’t, though. The momentum is angry.  It has been promoted from every angle without much, if any, criticism. Immigrants are important!  Yet, what seems to be left out is that we are all immigrants even after being citizens in the United States for generations.  We just don’t get carte blanche help from the motherlands, our government, or the other people, unless we have athletic ability, unbridled good looks, wealth, a successful music career, or access to make a theater production on a global scale. We are left to our own.  The only “united” is the airline name. Immigrants of today are not anything like the immigrants of years ago.  Most come here to advancements which are far different from what many of our families had or even have now.  Most expect everyone to take care of them and because they have persons connected in areas of media, science, and such who use their powers to condemn any of us who don’t see things the same way they do.  Some even go so far as to seek out, profile, ones of us to watch, stand by us, use us and such until they find a better offer to move on. After all there are many of us who don’t have it all even though we live in the United States and, despite how it may look, we have the same problems here too, only with alterations.  But what is perplexing is this…if those from another can become prominent in the United States with their own story then why would it be necessary to rewrite another prominent person’s story of a different culture and take it as their own? Could it be that an acceptance is on the forefront?  One that knows, deep down, that we are not all that different?  After all hard work doesn’t have one face.  Neither does persistence or ingenuity.  Caring isn’t limited by any factors set up by any system and best of all…LOVE cannot be contained. Sure.  But on the flipside of what is ideal is the undesired…slavery also doesn’t have one face.  Starvation of body and mind hasn’t any limits.  Abuse is not necessarily contained to only what or who is in front of us.  In order to be whole we have to accept this too."

As predictable as night follows day. When will Australia stop throwing buckets of public funds at hate-based movie makers wanting to create division for division’s sake? The script (what little there is) by Steven McGregor and David Tranter is supposedly set in the 1920s but, the endless prolific swearing sounds more like 2018 – seems they can’t see past their own era. Yes, it’s a sad case but their characters are one dimensional and totally predictable, as are the majority of situations posed in their loosely based plot. Editor, Nick Meyers seems to be trying to add interest by cutting in flash-forwards (and back) but this simply makes the lack of up-front, solid interest, more noticeable. If local director Warwick Thornton grew up watching spaghetti westerns – then he didn’t have a chance, because all he’s doing is transposing them into Australiana. The movie is also painfully stretched out it could be watched at 2 x speed and the viewer would miss nothing. Thornton’s photographic direction is excellent (he should stay with this as his chosen profession) or was it actually co-photographer Dylan River who guided much of this?  Equally good, was the sound recordist’s professional work but, he also doubles as co-writer and leaves something to be desired – maybe stay in the field your best at.   The unrelentingly nasty, foul-mouthed characters are simply too obviously set-up to be believed or taken seriously – other than by viewers who do not balance their viewing habits and watch only this type of ‘entertainment’ or are guilty partners of the ‘them and us’ hate driven crowd – those who continually drag this sorry world down to their pathetic levels. Brian Brown’s Police Sergeant‘s character is so superficial you could almost hear the production executives calling for a ‘marketable’ name to be added to the cast – same applies for Sam Neil, who plays the only ‘Christian’ to inhabit this crude land (and Sam plays this out in his obvious atheistic manner) The Aboriginal casting is good and Matt Day does considerably well playing Judge Taylor. Maybe it’s time for Australian moviemaking to grow up and move forward.  Much time and money will be spent on marketing this movie overseas but might be better invested in a more positive endeavour. Not sure why American Johnny Cash, singing Thomas Dorsey’s “Peace in the Valley” was chosen for the end credits?  If it was for satirical contrast - it simply didn’t quite work.

Acting is great especially from Tom, and the father is more of a supporting act. But other than that it’s like watching a candle melt and waiting for something to happen. We’re never told anything about the Father other than he’s ex-military and might have ptsd. Nor the where why of the plot, it’s just empty and left for interpretation. Before the credits rolled I was like “this can’t be it right?” and before I knew it the credits rolled. It’s like any adventure movie going for the climax and never getting there.

At first she talks like a nine or ten year old, but we can see she is older than that. She's not menstruating? So let's say she is 12. She's an ""old soul"" as the social worker said of her. But she is still a kid. I'm just not sure about these movies that are completely reliant on self possessed, motherless girls. I had the same reaction to the book, Secret Life of Bees. And bees are featured in this movie as some kind of metaphor for life. The story was way too idealized. Motherless girls are not self possessed. They grow up in many was dissociated from their own feelings. The film was beautifully made. I just wish the story had more realism to the inner life of the girl.

Hell Or High Water

The problem in a character driven movie is that if it ain't interesting, gripping or cognitive the feature starts to fade off slowly and the only thing remains is the ticking clock which takes too much of its time to finish of what was started. David Mackenzie is no short on execution but doesn't seek attention and fails to utilize the script by Taylor Sheridan which frankly had more potential than it was projected. Jeff Bridges is straight out amazing along with a great cast like Chris Pine and Ben Foster who are giving their all in. Hell Or High Water is not the cure, its the disease that even though slowly but surely is taking away the essence (brilliant screenplay, stellar performances and even background score) out of it."

It's a very slow-paced movie, what you don't expect from a heist movie. I felt like the movie was unfinished.

The police spend most of their time engaged in idle banter and do virtually nothing that might be described as ""police work"" or ""investigating"" unless you include making wild guesses.  The justification for the two brothers committing all kinds of mayhem is slim at best and boils down to the argument that they will lose everything if they don't pay off the mortgage on time.  Well, that's a little bit like saying, ""Hey, I've got cancer, so it's OK for me to become a vicious druglord because how else am I going to provide for my family after I'm dead.""

If that's how your moral compass points the way then you have my condolences.

For me, the high point of the film was what amounted to a comic reenactment of the Northfield, Minnesota, ""raid"" of 1876 in which most of the James-Younger gang got themselves very nearly shot to pieces by ordinary citizens who grabbed rifles from the local general store.

I do not recommend this film unless you seriously have nothing better to do."
1854,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hell-or-high-water/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,saintdecky,"Feb 2, 2017",6,"I went into this movie with very high expectations. I have just seen it even though it had been out for nearly half a year, and have gotten countless recommendations for this movie, as well as seeing lots of positive reviews for it. The movie had also gotten an Oscar nomination for best picture, increasing my expectations. Sadly, I was left unsatisfied.

Characters/Acting: The acting was well done; Chris Pine did an excellent job of portraying his character, better than I had expected. I'm looking forward to hopefully seeing him in more dramatic, Oscar-worthy performances in the future. Ben Foster did a good job as well, but Jeff Bridges, in my mind, seemed a bit overrated. He played a very Jeff Bridges character, and though he did have a good range of emotions in a few scenes, he didn't do much throughout the movie. I also didn't feel like there was enough of a connection or comparison between the two pairs of characters (Pine and Foster as brothers and Bridges and Gil Birmingham as the 2 cops). They barely even met, and I didn't feel a good comparison between the two kinds, if that's what the movie was going for.

Cinematography: Throughout the duration of the movie, there are countless, and I mean perpetual, endless shots of the small, depressed lands of Texas that the movie takes place in. Eventually I found the shots boring and repetitive, to the point where I was almost saying ""if I see another shot of a barren wasteland in Texas, I'm going to throw my remote into the television.""

Overall, the movie isn't necessarily bad; it's an okay way to kill two hours. If I didn't have such high expectations from what I had read and other people suggesting it for me, I may have knocked the rating up to a 7.
Also, whenever you see it, stick around for the T-bone restaurant scene, it's the best and funniest scene of the whole movie."

It tells the story of two bank robber brothers, facing the old, fat and decaying hand of the law. Few things happen across the movie, making it very hard to follow, the beginning being the worst part; the western characteristic that defines the film is only noticeable in the climax (and the music), a bit more thrilling and enjoyable. The three main characters are poorly defined mostly superficially. One brother short tempered, not very smart and of unpredictable behavior; the other representing the brain of the gang, with an admirable objective but incoherent parenting; and the near to retirement ranger that wants one last glimpse of adventure. A thing to highlight is the process of recognition that two of these characters go throw as the plot cultivates, and that creates a different outcome however different not in all cases means good. Above all, the performances are interesting, especially Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster, also the photography is classy; but it’s not enough. Don’t mention this film again, come hell or high water."

Unfortunately it does not deliver.  What a let down considering the great word of mouth, solid cast and welcome genre.  Jackass critics over-praise yet again here doing nobody but the makers and themselves a favor!  The idiots obviously grade on a curve.  Do they give this mild effort a break only because everything else is so piss poor?  They're unfit to be giving their worthless opinions on anything.
Jeff Bridges is a very fine actor and one of the great contemporary movie stars.  Lifelong fan and he's in my top three favorite movie stars.  He's good here and all the funny lines are delivered by his character, but that's about all that's good in this film.  The script is weak on story.  Low stakes, high boredom with contrived characters in cliché circumstances that have been put on screen countless times.  The motivating family backstory is not going to be bought by a thinking audience.  Obviously the writer and director were trying to comment on the modern West (actually its Texas here) with their dissertation in the forefront, and the lame story taking the backseat.  Major mistake and it never works.  If you want to do that then go make a documentary, write a book or become a painter because Hollywood movies should always be about strong narrative.  Any kind of message on the nature of things should be sub-text, always!  The audience needs a good story and the rest can filter through sub-consciously or even overtly, but the priority must be on story.  The rookies behind this either don't get that, or just couldn't come up with the goods.  (""Sicario"" was a pretty phony and thin movie for that matter.)  The tone and craft of this movie are fine and that's what the sheep critics are all flocking around because they are very easily fooled.  It's a slow slog building up to nothing much.

Also there is a ridiculous logic flaw in the plot, what little plot there is.  And not a flaw but maybe more troubling is a lack of moral subjectivity by the authorship of the film.  The anti-hero is nothing new.  What is are today's Leftist amoral filmmakers who don't pass judgment on extreme violence but show it matter of factly which is more realistic (except for the ubiquitous blood splatter now in shows and movies which is not realistic most of the time and in some ways the old code movies completely devoid of it are actually more realistic), however less reasonable for an audience looking for meaning.  The tone shifts from buddy joking to cold blooded killing by characters the filmmakers intend you to like.  That's not the problem.  The lack of more of a moral payoff is.  The danger is a culture heading for a complete lack of morality in the arts."

It takes great elements from a huge variety of sources and recreates them in it's own, small world while providing only a minimum of context. They're amusing to see, but like the Eiffel Tower in the desert, you know that it's a pale imitation of the original.

That said, this isn't a bad movie, but it's not nearly the masterpiece that the many 90+ critics' scores might lead you to otherwise believe. The entire movie feels like West Texas written and directed by a NYC film student who knows the geography and people only through watching other movies set in the same location. There are so many cliches in the character creation, the dialog and the cinematography that's it's a bit overwhelming, but contained within the individual scenes are plenty of gems that make the movie worthwhile.

Bridges and Birmingham are walking on thread-bare, cop-partner carpet. Pine does his best ""Amarillo Raylan Givens"" imitation. Every scene is accompanied by some cliched Texas noir soundtrack music. Once in a while I wished for there to be no music so that I could decide myself on the mood of a particular scene. The recurring billboards on the side of the road are about as subtle as a Roadrunner cartoon. There is absolutely no chemistry between Pine and Ben Foster (his movie brother). There's no reason at all to believe that the two of them would be undertaking something like this together.

But as mentioned, there are individual scenes that are poignant, funny, sad and pleasantly incongruous which make this a worthwhile spending of your time and money."

Anyway, „Aquarius“ is the only good one of the bunch. It’s maybe half an hour too long and slows almost to standstill at times, so I won’t give it a higher score. But for movie lovers, it’s worth the time.
The story is about Clara (Sonja Braga), the last resident in the old upper-class apartment house that the property company can’t wait to take down. The 65 year old woman has pledged to only leave the place upon her death, and will engage in a cold war of sorts with the company.
On deeper level, it’s about having lost the purpose in life, which doesn’t really depend on number of people or friends and family surrounding you, and how bad things can bring motivation to continue fighting.
In some improtant ways, ""Aquarius"" is similar to this popular French movie „Elle“, both released in 2016 and premieried in Cannes Film Festival.
Both are about strong female character getting kind of old but still ready to continue fighting after bad things happen, and deal with extended family around her. ""Elle"" has Isabelle Huppert in the lead, ""Aquarius"" has Sonja Braga.
Both are also worthy movies in their own right, although could win from being a bit shorter. But in comparision, ""Elle"" is flashier and offers more quick excitement, whereas ""Aquarius"" feels like its artsy sister.
Screenwriter and director Kleber Mendonça Filho has chosen as non-flashiest approach to storytelling as possible. This works both for the movie’s favor, or against it, depending on the taste of viewer.
The characters, events and relationships are so real-life-like that it can alienate many viewers who will claim that „it’s boring“, „nothing is happening“, or something along these lines. The others will, vice versa, applaud the sharpness Filho has achieved in portraying people and relationships as they would really be in life. It’s an art in itself, really.
Just like in „Elle“, the central character and leading lady’s portrayal of her gives the viewer constant joy and is easily the noteworthiest thing in the whole result (which, of course, was the goal).
Sonja Braga amazes with her subtle but powerful acting especially in Clara’s moments of great stress such as troubles with children, or when things with property company turn nastier.
I’m not very good at describing exactly how well Braga has played out all the different shades and aspects of the woman's personality – from healthy pride that rises from knowing your worth and place in life to inflexible stubbornness, from being dead inside to still discovering lust for life in some ways. But I assure you that it’s a classy work from the thespian clearly on top of her game.
Sadly, „Aquarius“ did not turn out to be Brazil's submission for the 2017's foreign-language Oscar race, so it may not win more international attention than it already has. But it may be worth your time if you don't mind spending time on getting to know the people on screen.
„Aquarius“ is not compact enough to get easy recommendation – honestly, you will test your endurance at times – but all in all, I quite liked it. Easy to like a story centred on such a strong and intelligent female character, or actress as Sonja Braga."
1866,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/aquarius/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Nov 4, 2016",4,"""Aquarius"" is a slow moving 2 hour and 22 minute movie that would have been a very interesting hour and 45 minute movie. Director, and screenplay writer, Kleber Mendonca Filho puts in too many unnecessary scenes that add nothing to the film or plot except to tell us more than we need to know about Clara, who is at the center of the film. There is a scene at a cemetery, another of Clara's grandbaby running around nude and still another of a couple having sex on a beach not to forget an explicit orgy scene.

The story is basically of Clara who is the last tenet who owns an apartment in a building that a developer wants to tear down and make a tower of condos. She is comfortable with her life and has no desire to sell, move, uproot the life she has. We learn about Clara's daily life whether going for a swim every morning at the beach across the street, her battle with cancer that has left her scarred, he daughter recently divorced, one son who is gay and another son who is the father of her favorite grandson, having a night out with girlfriends, a possible romantic encounter that doesn't work out, a 'escort' that does plus her work as a music journalist writing books along with relatives and friends from the past and present. At the same time there is the story of the developer and his grandson trying at first to buy her out and then taking other methods.

Along the way there are discussions about how skin color affects lives in Brazil, where the picture takes place, as society gets into business and education can make a man's grandson think he the smartest one of making decisions to move things along. There are the children who who think the mother is making a selfish decision in not selling the house and her housekeeper/friend who lost her son a year before. And folks we haven't even touched upon the lifeguard, the church group and things going on inside and out side the building and Clara's apartment.

What makes ""Aquaruis"" special, a film to watch, is the performance by Sonia Braga who lets you know everything about the woman by the way she walks, talks, treats others, dresses, laughs, deals with problems, listens to music and shows love to family, friends and life. Braga defines the camera falling in love with a face.

Watching ""Aquarius"" I wished there was a fast forward button if for no other reason than to get past the cemetery scene and the three others mentioned in the first paragraph."
1867,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/aquarius/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,TVJerry,"Oct 24, 2016",6,"This is a showcase for Sonia Braga. She plays a widow who staunchly goes thru life with family and friends (and some flashbacks). She's the last resident of her building and won't sell to the owners, who want to replace it with a luxury residence. Her refusal serves as the conflict around which her daily life takes place. There are lots of little moments, quiet observations and an ambiguous ending, typical of foreign cinema. Braga is wonderful to watch, which is good since this film is more about character than plot.

There were times during this movie that we're just straight-up cringe. For example, I get how Tony Stark could become a genius. The prodigy son of a famous inventor who was already extremely wealthy. And spent a lot of his lifetime trying to live up to his father.

The whole premise of the young lady who is basically Tony Stark 2.0 was just unbelievable. You can't expect the audience to buy into this type of character. And the same goes for Shuri. How do you bypass so many other qualified women and men and then choose to make Shuri BP. And then overnight she suddenly a master of martial arts....

1878,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/black-panther/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,kyle20ellis,"Mar 24, 2022",6,"Wanted to see 'Black Panther' for a while, one of my most anticipated films of this early half of 2018 and as somebody who likes to loves most of Marvel's films. The idea was interesting as was what the film was hyped up to be, the trailer looked great and the high ratings and critical acclaim promised even more.

My thoughts were that 'Black Panther' was a decent and intriguing film with a lot of very well done to great elements, but it didn't blow me away and left me disappointed after the hype. As indicated, far from hated it, didn't love it. Actually saw 'Black Panther' on opening weekend in a sold out showing (it was touch and go as to whether a ticket could be gotten), but had to properly form my thoughts for a while and was nervous seeing the very divisive IMDb reaction and the condescension on both sides (mostly negative), which has slightly died down since to feel less nervous.

Starting with the good/great things, 'Black Panther' is mostly impressive visually. The special effects were variable, but there were some spectacular ones, while it's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and sumptuously costumed. It's the extraordinary production design that was most note-worthy. Loved the use of technology, which was really cool. The music has the right amount of haunting intensity, energy, dignity and pathos, so a fine score on its own but not always utilised right in the film, a few ill-fitting moments mood-wise.

Much of the action is exciting, though there could have been more, and there is a good deal of thought-provoking script-writing with some nicely injected humour. One is immersed in the world of Wakanda, which is a fascinating world in thematic terms. The story does grip once it gets going and doesn't feel as confused and jumpy, with timeline and location changes needing to be clearer, like it did to begin with and a lot of it even when turning our everyday struggles on their heads is surprisingly relevant.

Personally thought that much of the acting was good, with a very charismatic lead performance from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan bringing a self-loathing conflicted edge and swagger to Killmonger and Andy Serkis relishing his role with aplomb. The women are just as good, with a dignified Lupita Nyong'o, regal, no-nonsense and feisty Danai Gurira and particularly a funny and endearing Letitia Wright. While his role is small, Daniel Kaluuya is great fun in it. Direction is above competent, if not innovative, and really appreciated the film making Killmonger more than the standard Marvel villain, here one with questionable personal motives but one where one can see his point of view and empathise. Although his actions are inconsistent and don't always make sense and he could have been more threatening, generally he is one of the better Marvel villains and the most developed character in a film too full of stock ones (the titular character being the other exception).

'Black Panther' has faults however. Most of the characters are stock and clichéd, while some of the first half is too talky, the film is a little slow-going and confused to start with and some of the political elements are laid on too thick. Adding to the general feel that, even with the splashes of humour, the film takes itself too seriously and with the amount of predictability it has doesn't do enough new with a novel concept.

There are exceptions to the cast. Forrest Whittaker is wasted as a non-developed character with too short screen time, on top of the scene being rushed his final scene has no impact as a result. Martin Freeman is too fish out of water as well.

Although some of the effects are spectacular, others are very ropy. Especially in the final action scene between Black Panther and Killmonger which resembled a very early days/years video game. That scene also felt rushed, sometimes vaguely choreographed and anti-climactic, though the whole climax felt over-stuffed and too busy.

Overall, decent and interesting but was expecting more. Personally don't think it's the best Marvel film, while a long way from bad let alone terrible, for me it's one of the weaker ones. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

Giving this movie an almost perfect score is absolute non-sense. Chadwick Boseman is a fantastic actor and I liked his portrayal of Black Panther in the other Marvel movies (Civil War and Infinity War) but his role in his own movie fell flat. Not because of his acting, but he wasn't given much from the writers. The coolest characters were the villains and side characters. The Dialogue was flat and the humor was pretty much non-existent. The action scenes were OK at times but fell short because of the bad CGI and lazy choreography. The last fight scene looked like something out of 2008. I own all the Blade movies on VHS and I was happy to see a new black super hero for a change. It just didn't do it justice and Black Panther deserves better. Overall, it wasn't terrible and I would rank it right in the middle of the rest of the Marvel movies out there so far."

Anyway the plot is fine I suppose. The only character I liked throughout the film was T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) he was likable for the most part. My problem is that there was no scene that really stuck with me like all the other films in the MCU and for that it was pretty boring. The acting is brilliant however. They made the scenes a lot more believable. I did like the idea of Wakanda being technologically superior surrounded by third world poverty and the moral dilemmas it could bring up (However unrealistic) It's a lot like the comics in some ways but despite everything good, the clear political agendas really take away from the experience.

The problems of the film are the slowness and the cliché of the plot, making it really boring and hard to follow. There is a subtle topic, well addressed in the story; is the cyclic characteristic of the physical and psychological journey made by the protagonist, noticed in her both trips when she interacts with two other girls.

To me, the plot was rushed, taking a story being told over a span of a year and a half or longer and cramming it into 1 hour and 56 minutes. Some films have demonstrated that a movie can have a plot that spans over a year or longer such as Forrest Gump or Aviator. Sadly, this movie could not largely due to the poor directorial and screenplay works by John Crowley and Nick Hornby.

Acting is good from the two main leads and the chemistry between them is believable. It moves off fast and then keeps a reasonably steady pace, but it seems to drop a bit towards the third act which is odd as that is when the main premise of the film comes into effect.
Set and costume design really immerse you in the time and place of the films settings. I did find the reason for why Eilis became confused between two men rushed and not too fully established along with it being a little too quickly resolved, and also bringing a lack of Domhnall Glesson; who did not get used properly.
Overall the film is a nice tale of a love triangle that only becomes evident in the third act that does have its emotional moments and strong points, but is still flawed. A worthwhile watch for the most part.

Based on James Baldwin's 1974 novel of the same name, If Beale Street Could Talk is aesthetically faultless, but much like writer/director Barry Jenkins's previous film, Moonlight (2017), the totality is considerably less than the sum of its parts. The biggest problem is the love story. Employing a Terrence Malick-esque esoteric voiceover, Jenkins lifts entire passages directly from Baldwin. However, what reads beautifully in the novel is badly out of place in the film, even in voiceover, and has the effect of rendering the two central characters unrealistic, with their love for one another idealised to such an extent as to become ridiculous.

New York, 1974; 19-year old Clementine ""Tish"" Rivers (KiKi Layne) and 22-year old Alonzo ""Fonny"" Hunt (Stephan James) are in love, and planning to get married. However, when Fonny is accused of ****, the victim mistakenly identifies him in a line-up, and he is charged and detained. Awaiting his trial, Tish visits him in jail, telling him she is pregnant, and promising she'll do whatever it takes to get him out before the birth. With this as the central framework, the story is told in a non-linear style, jumping back and forth from one time period to another.

This non-linear structure has an important thematic effect; we know from the second scene that Fonny is in jail, meaning that as we watch Tish and Fonny planning their future, there's a shadow over everything. For the most part, this contributes to the tone of the film. However, Jenkins overuses the technique. I understand why the film is told out of sequence, but not to the extent it is. Compare this with Sean Penn's The Pledge (2001), a linear narrative where he accomplishes the same thing with one out-of-sequence scene at the start of the film. Beale Street, on the other hand, jumps all over the place, never settling into a rhythm, with the cumulative effect one of distraction rather than immersion.

Aesthetically, much like Moonlight, If Beale Street Could Talk looks amazing. From James Laxton's vibrant cinematography to Caroline Eselin's colour coordinated costume design, everything we see rings true, and much like Moonlight, the influence of Kar-Wai Wong is paramount; seen in the non-linear narrative and relatively slight plot, the poetic tone, the centrality of music, and the tendency to use visuals rather than dialogue to convey thematic points.

As in both Medicine for Melancholy (2008) and Moonlight, Jenkins occasionally has characters speak directly to camera. They're not breaking the fourth wall, however. Such scenes are dialogue scenes, with the camera between the characters. It's a technique that was used most famously in The Silence of the Lambs, where each character looked into camera when speaking to Clarisse, whereas she always looked just slightly off-camera, setting up a fascinating visual contrast which encourages us to identify with her. Beale Street doesn't do anything as interesting or subtle with the technique, but Jenkins's tendency to use it during moments of heightened emotion does suture us into the milieu of the film.

However, a serious problem at the film's core is the love story, wherein Fonny and Tish just don't seem like real people, not in the way they gaze into one another's eyes as if they are seeing each other for the first time, not in the way they speak to one another as if every syllable is of **** portentousness. They rarely speak normally; instead, they adopt the eloquence of James Baldwin. In lifting sections directly from the novel, Jenkins forgets that what works on the page, doesn't necessarily work on the screen, and the reproduction of Baldwin's rich and lugubrious prose is simply unrealistic, with the delivery sounding stilted and awkward, and, most egregiously, far beyond the lexicon of the characters.

Another problem concerns the depiction of Bell (Ed Skrein), the racist cop who frames Fonny. Played as a leering pantomime villain, with bad hair, bad teeth, and bad skin, he's obviously a metaphor for the ugliness of racism, but he's so completely over the top, it rips you right out of the film. On the other hand, Regina King's portrayal of Tish's mother, Sharon, is exceptional.

Beale Street is an undeniably beautiful film that depicts the love between two astonishingly attractive people (it's worth noting that in the novel, Fonny's unattractiveness is emphasised). However, Jenkins's interpretation turns Fonny and Tish into a Ken and Barbie-esque couple. Taking a meditative approach to the material, Jenkins's adaptation never rings true. Whereas Baldwin's Tish and Fonny are flawed, contradictory, and relatable, Jenkins's protagonists are too-perfect-to-be-real, with every agonisingly serious pronouncement they make to one another pushing them further and further away from connecting with the audience on an emotional level."

With the help of their families they now must do everything in their power to prove Fonny's innocence.

Director Barry Jenkins creates another powerfully emotional story, it's just if we're comparing films here Moonlight is without a doubt far superior. Sometimes a film's plot moves so painfully slow when it's time to make a statement it's too late because the audience has already fallen asleep. No I didn't love If Beale Street Could Talk, the story moved much too slow for me and I found myself losing interest. The score by Nicholas Britell is just as spectacular as the Moonlight soundtrack. A gorgeous soundtrack that I'm still listening to and if it doesn't win the Oscar for Best Original Score I'll be very surprised. But even with the score, the cinematography and the acting everything seemed unnecessarily dragged out. I didn't feel every scene needed to linger so long, it lost its effect and eventually the whole film felt like it was moving in slow motion.

A young African-American man is convicted of a crime he didn't commit in Harlem, New York during the 70s, while his pregnant fiancee and her mother fight fiercely to prove that he didn't do it. Sadly, there is no nuance here. We are commanded by the director to be outraged, and we are.

Loosely based on the life of director Pedro Almodovar, this semi-autobiographical story about a filmmaker looking back on his life feels like it's going toward a destination at which it never quite arrives, despite a clever ending that provides a last-minute refreshing perspective on the work overall. I was disappointed, though, that the picture never quite led anywhere more meaningful or profound, despite a fervent hope that it would eventually do so. Fans of Almodovar's work will undoubtedly relish this love letter to his art and his audience (and some would say himself), but less ardent viewers of his films are likely to end up, as I have, seeing it as a generally inoffensive though ultimately lacking exercise. I'd be going too far if I were to call it self-indulgent, but there does seem to be a self-congratulatory element to it that overrides most anything else the film is trying to say."

In the category of self-referential, self-analytical and autobiographical art, I consider more interesting the comparison with other authors than those I found mentioned in the reviews at ""Dolor y gloria"". I didn't perceive it as an accomplished film, I didn't get the impression that Almodóvar wanted or knew how to transfigure his very personal material. The beginning with the chapters ""geography"" and above all ""anatomy"", an animated list of the various ailments of health, promised a form of Trierian reworking, powerfully ingenious, sarcastic to the limit of autoparody, but they are not color tones that belong to Pedro's palette. Another notorious director for the tormented quest to extend his own navel to the human condition is Moretti, and his best film is that ""Caro diario"" (1993) in which he has bound himself to a classical structure like the Wolffian one (the same present also in ""Antichrist"", 2009). Here instead we are close to a stream of consciousness, liberating and cathartic more for those who express it than for those who receive it.

This documentary film is not in detail like any normal documentary does, to highlight the rights and wrongs. Actually, it speaks less and reveals more through its pictures. So anybody can make their own narration watching this film. The filmmakers left that part empty for you the viewers to decide. But my advice for you if you want to try this, that don't expect it to be about the 'immigration' alone. This film was multi-layered. There are many angles of focus about different topics, but kind of all are connected which is the Mediterranean Sea.

So the common thing in the film is the Sea that divides the two continents, Europe and Africa. This film sets around that region about the people who depended on it for the living, growing up and looking for the fresh life start. But the majority of those who saw it recognise only the refugees who cross the sea. That's wrong to label this film is about the refugees. Around 20-25 per cent of the film concentrated on that issue. Only about their struggle on their journey to the other side, but it reveals nothing on its root cause. If you ask me, I would say only one religion making all this mess in the middle-east, otherwise you won't see the western army in that region.

Some of the clips, the real ones are really disturbing. I won't blame those people who took such risk to get the other side of the sea. Believe me, I'm not a nationalist, so I won't believe in borders and regions that divided over language and ethnicity base. But I do mind the religious. If that was eradicated from the earth's surface, particularly one that's causing all the trouble immediately, we can co-exist peacefully. That's the major issue here, but we're after temporary solution. The film does not say all this, but you will get the clear picture.

""The ships fired rockets and at sea. It was like there was fire at sea.""

For me this was an average film. I have seen the much better documentaries than this on various issues of the world. The filmmakers don't want to take sides, so they only revealed the truth by just following and making videos of life in and around the Mediterranean Sea. Like I meantioned earlier, some of the angles do not make any sense or difficult to understand its purpose. I don't know the others, but I have got plenty of questions about the film to ask the filmmakers. If you are like me, welcome aboard.

It was the Italian entry for the 2017 Oscars and it did not make, but found a slot in the list of Best Documentary Feature. This is the first out of five from that category I have seen, so I don't know whether it wins the award or not, but as per the prediction made by film fanatics and critics, this is the frontrunner.

Whatever the result would be, I'm not recommending it particularly the common people. Because the film fails to narrate the story which is very essential from the average peoples' perspective to get the message clear and loud. All one can get with this is only the outline on the very important issue at the moment. Remember how the David Attenborough's narration made to reach all the corners of the earth. Confusing over the purpose of the documentary, possibly misleading. Its like watching a news channel on the mute mode. Otherwise, this should have been one of the best of its kind.

The story? Not so much, in my opinion. The sixth installment in the franchise really has a sense of direction when it all comes down to the big set-pieces. The cinematography is quite impressive during the chase sequences and the action is very well choreographed. However, the story is plain uninteresting from start to finish. It's kind of hard to feel anything for the characters when they are shuffled into a generic, by-the-numbers script. There are some stakes, but overall the movie just doesn't do them justice. The film ends in the most harmless way possible and I left the theater completely unsatisfied.

However, I do recommend you to go see this movie if you haven't already, as the action sequences mostly save it from being godawful.

1962,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/mission-impossible-fallout/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,TheQuietGamer,"Dec 30, 2018",6,"Immaculately crafted with a charming cast and spectacular stunts, this is everything you could ask for from a traditional spy movie. But it suffers from the same problems that begin to plague every long-running franchise at some point or another. Mainly a lack of danger and a larger history that makes it somewhat inaccessible to newcomers. I mean, are the IMF ever not going to save the day? I think not.

We already know that Hunt and his crew are going to be okay so there's no real urgency. Luckily, the people behind the movie knew this and took a more sentimental approach that celebrates the characters and their relationships with one another. It's surprisingly effective, but only if you've been keeping up with the series over the years. Naturally this won't have any impact on those popping in for the first time to see for themselves why this is being heralded by so many as ""one of the greatest action movies ever made."" A praise I find to be a little overzealous.

The set-pieces are gorgeously shot, I don't have words to describe how clean the choreography for the fist-fight and shootouts is, and it's crazy to think Cruise performed all these stunts himself. That being said, I found nothing here that was able to top anything from Rogue Nation. How do you beat a guy hanging on side of a plane after all?

The plot is your standard collection of spy movie cliches, only dialed up to 11. There are more twists, double crosses, and hidden agendas than I would have ever thought could be fit into a single movie. And, big surprise, the new characters are the ones you can't trust. Because of how melodramatic all of that seems, Fallout is at it's best when it's focusing on the action at hand. Mostly because it's a lot of fun to watch Cruise and Cavill make a mess out of what should have been smooth operations. These are some of the most buffoonish spies you'll ever meet. Not only is luck almost never on their side, but they do a great job of regularly screwing themselves over in humorous ways.

Main character Ethan Hunt is by far the most compelling part of the package. The way he analyzes every move he makes to ensure that his friends and civilians aren't harmed all while being riddled with guilt over past actions is endearing. I loved how the film explored his selfless motivations and sacrifices all while being backed up by a wonderfully layered performance its star. This is coming from someone who's not a Tom Cruise fan.

Henry Cavill makes a better villain than he ever has a hero, but is still vocally stiff. His monotone delivery of lines is at odds with his wonderfully expressive face. Those looks of condescension are pure gold.

Mission Impossible is still perfectly capable of delivering a steady supply of thrills, but at the same time has become dreadfully familiar. As a result it's hard to care about the needlessly complex and somewhat melodramatic quest for plutonium even with the added emotional edge that comes from the returning characters and thoughtful exploration of its lead. This might be the best put together in the series, but it falls just short of its most direct predecessor in terms of unforgettable moments. None this is to say I didn't enjoy the movie. It can be very exciting. I just think that it, and the spy genre as a whole, could use a bit of reinvention to make things feel fresh again because the predictability is only getting more noticeable with each passing release."

Presumably, J.J Abrams would have been a fool to turn down artistic ownership of both “Star” franchises, so I get why he was out after the fabulous MI:3. But what happened to Bird after Protocol? He delivered the quintessential and nearly flawless, espionage action thriller with the 4th MI entry, only to vanish, leaving the Impossible reigns to McQuarrie- a man who’s seemingly on some arcane mission to deliver “tantric” cinema. Every bit of protracted suspense, every drawn out thrill in McQuarrie’s MI universe S L O W L Y builds to a point when the viewer finally feels the big payout is coming, then...nothing.

Unfortunately, despite my eager anticipation for MI: Fallout, I was really disiappointed with the film because it had many problems compared with the other ones. I know I'm suppose to shut my brain for these films but the convuluted plot, hollow character arcs, general lack of tension/levity and multiple plot contrivances made it very hollow after the credits start rolling. First, there are some amazing things about this film. The action and scene flow of the middle section is superb and by far one of the most exhillarating experiences I had. Even seeing Tom Cruise at the old ripe age of 56 pulling of his own stunts is a sight to behold. There is a very exciting fake out in the middle film, and much of the chemistry of the characters still exist in this new installment with the White Widow stealing every scene she is in. However, the film is filled with many problems that make it less enjoyable compared with the rest.

The first problem noticable is that the opening scene(s) before even the credit starts takes way too long and is excruciatingly ponderous. We literally have 4 different scenes which amount to roughly 20 minutes of screentime before the credit role. This makes the film really poorly set up to begin with as characters come and go, and we are uncertain on where the characters are, who is who and what is established after two years since Rogue Nation. Henry Cavill's character is also a bumbling iditot which makes his latter purpose of the film much more ineffective. The first act takes really long to get going and when it does in Paris, its gets very convuluted with little screen time to digest what is actually going on. However, that said once the actual plot gets going, it becomes much more tolerable.

Another problem is that some of the action and choreography aint that great. Many people raved about the Bathroom scene, but that was really short and didnt have much action as compred to films such as John Wick, Oldboy etc. It was meh. Secondly the music is relatively boring and non-existent, as it was clear the new composer is very different from the previous one that worked on Rogue Nation with all the ochestral elements. Also the film paces very slow to get to the middle act. The third act is also filled with plot contrivances but you would know it because they literally spend 10 minutes talking about the character relationships and what is going to happen etc. Another character intergral to the series just randomly appears as well during this time, whilst Henry Cavilles character is reduced to being another generic side character by the end.

Its a shame that MI:Fallout doesn't flow as well as MI:4 and MI:5, but the plot contrivances and plot holes definitely make it one of the most shallowest. I wish they had developed the relationship between the characters more as there is one crucial scene in the middle was executed really well compared with the others. It is an enjoyable film but one that you will probably quickly forget by the end."
1974,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/mission-impossible-fallout/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GinaK,"Aug 1, 2018",4,"Certainly this is not a terrible movie, but it is much too long. 90 minutes would have been fine, but add an hour of Ethan running and repetitious car/motorcycle/helicopter chases and things get pretty dull. It doesn’t help that it’s obvious that a computer has been used to speed up the “Run, Ethan, Run. Run, Run, Run” sequences. The actors are quirky, Paris and London are nice for car chases, but anybody who has been to these cities knows that it is impossible to drive that fast unless a movie crew has paid to stop traffic early Sunday morning. I’ve seen this kind of thing done before many times – and done in more interesting ways in, for example, Bourne movies. If a lot of the padding had been cleverly cut out of this film, it would have been a whole lot better overall."

Ethan Hunt doesn't earn the ending, it was given to him.

1977,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/mission-impossible-fallout/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,The404,"Jul 28, 2018",4,"Honestly, this is one of the few movies I've ever been bored seeing in theaters because it is two and a half hours long and you feel it. You really feel it. This is due to how difficult it is to feel tension in scenes and how long the action scenes go on. You might be inclined to think ""but I like action so longer action scenes are fine."" Well, you'd be wrong because the action isn't even that good and lacks the sort of emotional investment you'd get in a better movie. Basically, the villains never get a moment to talk and become actual characters. The final fight scene should be full of investment due to the two characters who are fighting but they never even speak to each other. The bigger, badder, and supposedly cooler villain doesn't even do anything. He's just boring and his fight scene lacks the emotional weight needed for it to be so long. The movie's climax is immediately followed by another climax where you need the villains to start talking and build their character a bit more if you want to drag on the movie like this. The worst part is that the movie is painfully by the books in the end that the few twists there are can't carry the movie. Also, prepare for stormtrooper tier shooting.
When it comes to characters Benji and Luther feel important in the beginning but then immediately become just sidekicks that stay in background doing nothing. The entire focus is on Ethan and Walker so they kinda do little to nothing most of the time. Ethan is a kinda generic protagonist with little to mention but Walker is more interesting. His character is somewhat fleshed out and the choreographers knew how to make him look a big bruiser with a lot of weight behind all his attacks. His entire look gives him the look of a smart and dangerous man. The love interest is boring. She **** at shooting things. Moving on. The main villain doesn't do much and ends up doing very little himself and doesn't say anything smart enough to come off as a mastermind. Overall, not a bad movie but painfully average with an added issue of being too long which dips it even lower. Not the worst but nothing special."

While most of its ingredients are indeed noteworthy -- superb production values, stellar writing, and the positively exceptional performances by Chadwick Boseman (his final role), Viola Davis and Glynn Turman -- the components just don't mesh into a cohesive whole. Instead, viewers get an overly stagey production that consists of a series of insightful and eloquent soliloquies interspersed among occasional (though one might easily say far too few) musical numbers and meticulously orchestrated comic relief moments. Regrettably, the finished product feels more like parts of a story that got haphazardly glued together rather than a harmoniously blended composite, essentially a day in the life of the Mother of the Blues and the various individuals she interacted with on that day but not offering much depth about the relevance, meaning or legacy of those involvements. Consequently,  despite the film's strengths, viewers are likely to come away from this offering wanting more than they get, and that's unfortunate, both for audiences and for Ma Rainey, both of whom definitely deserve better."

Ma Rainey was a daring figure. The so-called Mother of Blues, was one of the first singers of the genre to be recorded, but in the film there is very little of her, if we speak seriously.

But certainly the marketing knows its strengths, and brings to the spotlight the mainstays of this story: Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman.

For Viola Davis it's another showcase to continue demonstrating her talent as an actress, while for Chadwick Boseman it becomes a tribute to his career, considering that he delivers one of his best performances.
I can safely assure that both will get nominations for their roles in the upcoming awards season.
Will they win some? Of that I'm not sure at all. Almost the entire film takes place in a recording studio, so there's barely changes of tone or pace in the narrative, so it's easy to say that this film won't be for all kind of audiences, but still is an excellent performance vehicle for its two lead actors, which in the end, is the best reason to watch this film."

'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom' is beautifully written character study that is glued together by fantastic music and costumes. The movie is an hour and 34 minutes long, yet leaves no room for filler, only the nitty-gritty of things.

Based on a stage play by August Wilson, the movie is structured and staged almost like a theatrical production, remarkably like 'Fences', another August Wilson adaptation. I think all of Wilson's film adaptations should approach this kind of style, because it helps make his work stand out from the other movie adaptations in a unique way.

Viola Davis is terrific as ""Mother of the Blues,"" Ma Rainey. Me calling her amazing isn't anything new, because when has Davis ever given a mediocre performance.

Chadwick ****. Not since Peter Finch in 'Network' and Heath Ledger in 'The Dark Knight', as an actor made his final bow on screen so legendary. I can only describe his performance as both heart-breaking and epic. With his death in mind, the scenes where his character goes into long and heated monologues that later changes its aim and point towards God; asking why the lord hates him so much for him to suffer, asking him to strike him down, yelling at the top of his brittle voice and tearful eyes, to strike him down where he stands, almost begging to be set free from the torment he had to endure for most of his life. Scenes like that hit differently now. Incredibly powerful."

The film consists of lots of loud dramatic monologing and the fact that it comes from a play is clear. Sure the actors were fine but it was nothing particularly ground-breaking as the reviews make it out to be.
Like Fences it has similar themes and the characters have similar overly dramatic monologs which it seems the people who have seen this have taken as an incredible feat of acting for some reason. However in my opinion it just seemed forced and again too stagy.
I think people are rating this film on obvious tragic factors which do not involve the film itself which is a shame and quite disappointing as they should be judging the film on its merits as they would any other film but that seems to be to much to ask of people currently.
Overall this film is ok, it has highly contrived dramatic speeches and the sets, costume, lighting and the general technical aspects of the film are nice. However it it too heavy handed in its handling of the story and the actors are sometimes guilty of overacting."

""Zhao falls into the now usual limits of her cinema: a fragile writing and the difficulty of really dissecting the theme she has chosen"" (Alessandro Aniballi). ""Nomadland"" is not a film about people who are houseless and without a steady job neither by choice nor by no choice. Fern dwells inside a van because she is imprisoned by a trauma that she cannot live with except in a perennial escape. Too private and personal issues to become a representation of the precariousness of existence, among landscape postcards of a nature as majestic as indifferent to the destiny of living beings and in the metaphysical uprooting of a lack of meaning that makes every decision equivalent. In fact, she continues to choose: the nomadic condition in and of the desert, detached from villages and communities in favor of ghost towns, solitude and isolation, abandoning any type of dog to itself.

Nevertheless, this was the case. I don't like documentaries about road trips, and I'm pretty sure this is what I just watched. Frances McDormand has noted in interviews that she has often fantasized about chucking it all in and taking off in a van, which in her case sounds more like a romantic fantasy about discovering the true beauty and true grit of America, perhaps something like Steinbeck’s Travels with Charley or maybe even Kerouac’s On the Road.

However, the story pretends to be about social justice, even though it is ironic that the protagonist in real life is a world-famous actress, whose net worth is listed as $30 million and whose husband's net worth is listed by various sources as being anywhere from $20 to $100 million. Half the cast is comprised of actors who are real van-dwellers, and in keeping with this pseudo-documentary style, there is very little plot, sparse dialogue, no dramatic tension, and an ending that resolves nothing.

The film stops just short of romanticizing the lifestyle of the homeless, or as it is rephrased, the ""houseless,"" which makes it sound better, but the film also ducks and basically hides under McDormand's van when it begs the question, how did it come to this in one of the richest countries in the world? Answer: Because there are not enough socialist programs in the United States, and yes, the government has a responsibility to take care of the people, which means, among other things, equitable distribution of income and higher taxes for the rich. This is not a subject that multimillionaire producers want to ponder–they would rather focus on wanderlust and beautiful sunsets.

Thus, there is no talk of the dangerous ultraconservatism that grips the United States, the rampant undereducation of the American people, the outrageous cost of American medical care and prescription drugs, the recent shocking wave of racism and antisemitism, the desperate need for stricter gun laws, and the list goes on. Some of these antecedents helped to land these people in their vans.

Sadly, if social justice is what the director and producers of Nomadland were after, they missed the mark by a mile."

It recently won Best Picture (Drama) and Best Director at the Golden Globes, and now, it is presumably the frontrunner for the top prize at this year's Academy Awards. I heard the buzz - good things - about Nomadland, and realizing that it is now available on Hulu, I decide to see what all the hype is about. By the title of this review, I have given away my opinion, but read below for more.

Nomadland's synopsis goes something like this: After the devastation of a small Nevada town by the collapse of the local factory, a lady in her sixties, Fern (Frances McDormand) embarks on an unsettled life living as a modern-day nomad. She moves from place to place in her van, taking seasonal jobs and making her way alone. Nomadland is directed by Chloe Zhao from her script based on a non-fiction book of the same name about the nomad lifestyle. The film features real-life nomads telling fictionalized accounts of their lives as well as breathtaking photography of the American West. Fern is just as devastated as the town was from its economic collapse we learn. It is all set up to be a potentially deeply emotional film about grief, self-discovery and loneliness.

Generally, I don't mind character studies, and this nomad lifestyle is intriguing. Why would one decide to live this way? What brought them to where they are? Those questions are explored in Fern's story. Frances McDormand is a good actress and so she's fully embodies this character. However, since the film is also populated with non-actors, who are real-life nomads, it is obvious that there is a naturalistic quality to their presence in the movie. I think it undercuts the fictional narrative. In fact, I'd rather have a documentary about those people and learn the how's and why's of how they came to be nomads. As it is, I was very bored following Fern's story. I checked at least 5 times how long I had to go in this movie. I will say though that the cinematography and the brilliant colors and landscapes of the American West are beautiful, but that is not enough to sustain and almost 2 hour movie.

If you have 2 hours to devote to watching a woman travel across the country doing odd jobs and not much else, then Nomadland may be the movie for you. There is potentially an interesting and emotional story here, but as it is, this movie is not what it could be. I'll wait for the documentary about nomads. For this, you only need on popped kernel of popcorn."

How powerful this film would've been if the screenwriter had mined these roles and given them the scenes they deserved!  And such opportunities for depth: The relationship with the David Strathairn character, Dave, and Fern's sister, who supplies some exposition about Fern's backstory but allows so little understanding of who are they are in themselves, and to each other. ""Spare"" is what I'd call this kind of writing, and sometimes less is more, but not here.  After spending two hours with Fern, I know her life (in minute detail), but I don't know HER.  Another underdevelopment:  The reasons why these people live with such hardship.  There's a systemic reason, and it has everything to do with the Amazon element that figures so prominently as a setting, while missing the opportunity to contrast its workers' lives with those who profit from them.  I didn't read the book, but I suspect it would've been a great source for the theme of the chasm between rich and poor that is the nation's growing disgrace.  With some flesh on the bones of its script, this movie could have been a true classic. Again:  What a shame."

1. You’re either easily emotionally manipulated (i.e., you cry during hallmark movies), or
2. While you know New York (or fill in the blank here with your city> does not comprise the entirety of humanity, you need a reminder every once in a while that there’s a whole world out there with different people and (what? really?) nature (gasp!).

Emotional manipulation is easy - sprinkle in great cinematography, an excellent score, (you can probably stop there for most of us), but also throw in poetry, sprinkle in a few poignant stories from real people with close-ups of the always stoic Frances McDormand reacting to those real stories – shake, and voila!  The producers and director of this movie-mentory, or docu-movie, or whatever, went to great lengths to make sure we knew most of the actors in this movie are not actors at all, but real people to get the greatest impact from their mostly sad vignettes. I’m glad they decided to not bite off anything controversial – glossing over the long shifts of an Amazon worker, and only very briefly showing the hard labor of a beet harvester (insert clip of Francis struggling to lift a bag of beets here) – but in a film of this type, where most of the heavy lifting is done by real actors, doesn’t there either need to be some story arc or at least a small lesson?  What they did beautifully is present the juxtapositioning of relationships and nature.  Linda or Patty (sorry, they kind of run together for me now) gives a very heartfelt dialog about going to Alaska again to swim with the sharks (or something) before she dies and I’m thinking – OK, now we're going to get to the meat of this thing.  Is she going to leave her friends and the relationships she’s built to die alone in Alaska?  But what I realized is - there really wasn’t much in the way of relationships (at least shown in the film) for her to leave.  Every time the camera dolly would follow Francis through the camp, we didn’t see much human interaction.  Sure, men would sit with pets on their laps, or someone would play the guitar, or people would sit staring into a fire, but nothing very meaningful from a humanity standpoint was going on.  I would go to Alaska too!  And this is where the film let us down.  There’s a sliver of a chance for great art here - a Winesburg, Ohio (Sherwood Anderson) opportunity to show the loneliness of people – a chance to cut the film to help us appreciate the family and friendships we have.  I’m not saying that Francis had to end up staying with Dave at the end, but make us feel the emotional toll of that decision.  Instead, they decided not to make any statements at all – to, I suppose, let the film “speak for itself”.  The problem is it does not."

‘Nomadland’ is one of those movies where nothing much happens, but it’s the type of movie you sit back and vibe with it.

This is a very attentive movie, where you journey along with this woman (played by Frances McDormand) who is fed up with her old life and decides to go off grid by traveling to different places while living in her van. She’s not homeless, just houseless. She is like a leaf that quietly and casually drifts from location to location. She encounters different people in this community, who are played by real nomads. Throughout the whole movie you are never in one place for too long, you just keep moving on.

I’ll give director Chloé Zhao and cinematographer Joshua James Richards major credit for they approach to a story like this. Zhao decision to include real nomads with their actual names in the movie as these characters made the story feel genuine and personal, which helps gives us a solid perspective on what life of a nomad is like but done in a respectful way that doesn’t intrude their lives. The cinematography from Joshua James Richards looks beautiful and does a great job showing off the Western landscape. Some locations can look so cold, and yet, other locations look so tranquil in the sunlight.

This movie is worth checking out just for Frances McDormand performance alone, as she is terrific in this movie. She plays Fern, an adventurous woman who is a child at heart, despite dealing with some personal issues from the inside that we are informed about briefly.

Also, I thought the real nomads were surprisingly good. I’m not sure if all the scenes with them are scripted or not, but either way I thought they were great.

While there’s a lot of things that I enjoyed and appreciated about this movie, but unfortunately it didn’t 100% connect with me on a emotional level. At first, I liked the whole open road freedom to the movie, because since the main character is never in one place, you too become a wanderer, but I also feel it misses the opportunity of a powerful character study, especially with a character like Fern when it’s clear that there’s more underneath the surface with her.

I found the pacing of the movie to be an issue for me, because with a two-hour runtime I would sometimes find myself losing interest in the characters and what was happening on screen, as the movie didn’t further develop or do anything with the content and ideas it presents.

While the music was appropriately used for certain scenes, but most of the time it felt really distracting and took me out of the scenes.

Overall rating: Again, there’s a lot of things that I appreciated about the movie and am interested in what Chloé Zhao has up her sleeves for Marvel’s ‘Eternals’, which I hope gives her the freedom to make whatever she wants in the late future, with the extra cash and name recognition."

Her sexual obsession and artistic awakening are explored thru her first-person narration (which becomes monotonous), social encounters and animated segments (in the underground comix style of Aline Kominsky-Crumb). Powley credibly captures the extremes of adolescent exhilaration, insecurity and longing. Filmmaker Marielle Heller has chosen to play down the obvious fashion and musical references to the period, in favor of a focus on the personal experience.

Those scenes are just preposterous and certainly affected my view off the rest of the film.  The scenes where the mother found out and reacted were also preposterous and badly written.  Again, no adult woman cuckolded like this would react in those ways.

An interesting story in spite of the key scenes that made no sense.  The actress in the lead role did a good job and was believable and likable much of the time.  The 2 adult leads were pretty lightweight and their parts were quite undeveloped and 2 dimensional.

What starts out as promising, if somewhat superficial slice of life, begins to fall apart in the last 20 minutes as the repercussions of Minnie’s sexual shenanigans ensures fall out for all the main characters. Taking place in San Francisco circa 1976 the story is centred on a 15 year old teenager, Minnie, embarking on various sexual adventures that lead her on the path to womanhood. Performances are really good with special mention to Kristen Wiig who makes much of her few scenes as the less than perfect mother. As Minnie, Bel Powley (often topless) is convincing as the not particularly attractive teen craving attention which ultimately jolts her into adulthood. Alexander Skarsgaard, also her mother’s boyfriend, is very likeable as the object of her attentions, even though his actions demonstrate weakness and are in reality contemptible to say the least.

To quote Allen, ""Thor would have to be better than this!""

I came home and read the reviews by A. O. Scott of the NY Times, Douglas Markowitz of New Times, Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune and Peter Travers, all who raved about the movie! Did they see the same movie I did? Or don't they know about the seedy strip not to far from DisneyWorld? (I did learn from a review that The Florida Project was the name for DisneyWorld in its planning stages!) Or are they unaware of the 'hidden homeless' in the United States?

As I use 10 words when I can use one director and co-writer Sean Baker, with Chris Bergoch, uses 5 scenes when 1 tells the same thing. There is no faulting the acting which includes William Dafoe as the manager of the purple motel where 22-year-old single mother Halley, played by Bria Vinate, and her 6-year-old daughter Moonie, played by 6-year-old Brooklynn Prince, live. Moonie's friends Scooty, played by Christopher Rivera, and Jancey, played by Valeria Cotto, among others are typical kids doing things, both bad and good, kids do and are mostly natural in their scenes.

After a very boring, 'where is this film going' 1hour and 50 minutes, we finally get the payoff in the last 5 minutes and all I can say is save your money and use your time for something else or go see a good movie like ""Marshall"" or ""Professor Marston and his Wonder Women""."
2045,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/timbuktu/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,unbiased-critic,"Jun 8, 2018",2,"To me the visual of the film is extremely insipid, savorless, amazingly dull and plainly disappointing! And in that area, someone will have to explain to me how cinematographer Sofian El Fani, who once again reveals himself as an amateur, actually did get a credit for this movie. Very rarely do we see technical challenges. The movie's visualization is so technically repetitive and mind-numbing that it makes the whole movie extremely boring (how many viewers did say they were checking their watch!). Timbuktu's stunning sandy deserts, lakes and caved houses, which should have been splendidly rendered, are regrettably reduced to being consistently filmed with the same elementary shots over and over. It could have been merely OK for a documentary (which the movie was supposed to be BTW). What makes the filming approach so tedious is that Sofian El Fani fails to convey emotions through camera angles (kind of reminded me of La vie d'Adèle where El Fani makes such an excessive use of close-ups that it becomes unbearably repetitive to the viewer).

So unless there was a political move to credit Tunisian film crew members, such as El Fani, (Original Score award to Amine Bouhafa was well deserved though), there is no technical basis whatsoever for him receiving this award for best cinematography. Globally, this film probably moved Western World viewers -- that's why it actually got credited--, but it no manner does it contribute to cinema or art."

Surtout avec un film hongrois non doublé bien entendu.
Remarquez, il aurait été doublé que ça aurait été un gâchis impardonnable : il n'y a rien de pire que de mobiliser nos meilleurs doubleurs pour doubler... euh un ""truc"" pareil. Bref, ça ferait mal au cul, comme on dit.

Pourtant, le sujet qui concerne les camps de la mort suscite évidemment une curiosité certaine. Mais souvent, la curiosité est un vilain défaut et on comprend pourquoi ici. Difficile donc de décrire cette ""palme"" mais nous tenterons néanmoins de le faire à nos risques et périls.

Le film est en 4/3 et le film est à 95% (ou peut-être 97%) filmé derrière l'épaule du rôle principal et on sent bien que pour les 5 ou 3% restants, ça emmerde le réalisateur de filmer autre chose que l'épaule de l'acteur ou sa brave tronche de prisonnier. La caméra suit donc à la trace le gars et garde la mise au point exclusivement sur lui ; de cette façon, tout le reste est flou... et pendant tout le putain de film, on ne sait pas ce qui se passe dans le camp parce qu'on ne voit que la tronche ou l'épaule du pauvre gars qui veut enterrer son fiston.

C'est donc pas regardable, ni au début, ni au milieu, ni à la fin. Et à part une scène précise (les exécutions au bord de la fosse) on pourrait se trouver dans n'importe endroit avec des prisonniers, n'importe quel camp de travail. Sauf que quand même ça parle allemand beaucoup évidemment et qu'on apprend la langue assez vite avec ""ya wol et arbeit"".

Le plus dingue dans tout ça, c'est que le film passe directement par dessus la tête et que son impact est réduit à zéro. Et pourtant, un camp de la mort, ce n'est pas une simple anecdote.

The cast looks nothing like the description in the book.
Jo does not act boyish enough as she is supposed to, and she does not look boyish either.
Amy, who is the youngest sister, looks older than everyone else, including Teddy. They have 24-years-old access playing 12-year-old kid! Her voice is deeper than her oldest sister Meg.
Teddy is supposed to be Joe’s age, but he looks like teenager when already married.
The only person who looks and acts appropriate for their role is probably Beth.
The storyline is a complete mess, keeps jumping back and forward between the first and second part of the book, and thus makes everything very confusing even for someone who was read the book, especially because the characters do not age, apparently, or change in any way.
There are a lot of made up moments and dialogues throughout the movie, that do not appear in the book.

Gerwig successfully took over a classic novel and twisted it to match her personal emotional agenda. Every choice made in this movie from the costumes (a personal Oscar snub in my opinion) that dishonor the characters and the time period to even showcasing music that came out long after the book was published. The non-linear structure paired with the lack of time sensitive choices, made it almost impossible to follow along. Every character except Jo is miscast, yes even the 23 year old playing the 12 year old. Meg meant to be the oldest who is concerned with fitting into society and behaving properly, and who is constantly telling Jo in the book what is in and out of fashion, is played as a hippie child who lets her down and is never seen in a bonnet? Beth, who offers much more to the dynamic of the March family than she is even given time to breathe in this movie. Amy, who is much like Meg in openly caring about social status and being swept away by a prince charming is played as a careless, annoying child. She should be played later in life as a poised, smart young woman but is seen screeching and flailing in public, which would have been her worst nightmare in the book. Don't even get me started on Gerwig turning the lime scene where she is physically assaulted by the teacher into a comedic sketch where she is then rewarded for her vapid behavior by getting to meet Laurie. Lastly, Marmee is supposed to resemble Jo, even saying that as a young woman she was temperamental and wild and angry. We can see this throughout the course of the 1994 movie through Susan Sarandon's acting. But when Laura Dern out of nowhere in the 2019 version says ""I'm angry all the time"" I don't feel or buy it whatsoever. Dern portrays her as a chill, hippie mom who somehow dyes her hair blonde and wears her buns aggressively high for the time period.

Worst of all is this obsession with remaking Little Women. The real Alcott family, especially the Dad, has a fascinating story to tell -- why don't filmmakers care about that? Amos reformed education, was an abolitionist & part of underground railroad movement. He was for women's rights, he was part of the transcendentalist movement & founded a ""utopian"" community ( it failed, but still), the family was vegetarian & wouldn't ""enslave animals"" - he was a true radical & American original. The family moved 22 times as he kept trying to bring his ideas forward & was often rejected. He palled around with Thoreau, Emerson & other luminaries.
One star for costumes."

This was an awful film, and they didnt even notice. Is this what is taken for art these days? Firstly, the writing was incredibly poor and the dialogue stilted and unnatural, likely because it reflected the book too literally and was not adequately adapted to a movie screenplay. Secondly, the direction was very poor. There were major gaps in the plot making it seem incoherent at times. It left the viewer disoriented. Thirdly, the acting was only fair to midling. These are lightweight actors and they did nothing to anchor a poorly written screenplay. The only good parts were the costumes and cinematography. I love period piece dramas.

One can but applaud him for being able to entice finance from the supposed ""hard-nosed"" money men of Tinseltown and make films that are only comprehensible to a very select few. How to approach his latest, ""The Favourite""? Some compare it to Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"", when in reality there are more than a few nods to the outlandish Ken Russell. Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? Is it a comedy drama or a drama comedy? Who can tell? Hopefully the locations and the costume providers have got Yorgos on their Christmas card list. As for the actresses whose talents have been largely wasted,let's hope their careers can survive their participation here. There were moments when all three were on screen at the same time and the power struggles all three endured would have made a more memorable film. Unfortunately the music of the film's composer would then raise its ugly head or the ""fish -eye"" lens of the cameraman would interfere and kill any drama stone-dead.
Hopefully ""word-of-mouth"" will kill this film off and at some point there will be a reality check amongst the critics who will finally realise that Yorgos has subjected them to an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" scenario yet again and they have been had not once, not twice but three times now."

Even though I had not liked director Yorgos Lanthimos's ""The Lobster"" between word of mouth regarding the performances of the 3 lead actresses and the talk of awards I was looking forward to 2 hours of fun, laughter and sarcastic wit. After an hour I was ready to walk out but I stayed and kept hoping something would happen for me to change my mind about this film.

Neither a duck race, a naked, fat man being pelted with pomegranates by other men in long curly wigs or a wife thinking/planning a way of getting rid of a rival's power over the queen while she **** her husband changed my mind.

Yes the acting by Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz is first rate, especially by Coleman, and the power struggles between Lady Sarah (Weisz) and her cousin Abigail (Stone) including seducing the Queen (Coleman), mentally and physically, plus playing the men, in many ways, is typical of the genre while the war games between the heads of State of the French and English is really ho-hum.

""The Favorurite"" took 2 hours of my life and didn't give me 1 laugh but it did give long, dark walks along castle hallways and backways with panoramic scenes of ballrooms, bedrooms and meeting rooms. It also gave me a very annoying soundtrack of what seemed, in 50% of the film, was a beat and what sounded like a bell.

If it's supposed to be feminist film it does a bad job at portraying a feminist vision.

I'm sorry but that is far from a feminist film.

I will not even say the director of photography was that good either, there are no memorable scenes other than the hypocritical garbage I've talked about.

Dune Chapter 1 is ACTUALLY a visually impressive film albeit poorly written because it's broken up in parts and unwatchable without the full story, but you get my drift.

This movie is only great for the first 30 minutes until the ""plot"" kicks in and you see it as just a shameless Liberal Feminist film which it is and it tries to hide it with violent action but the action fails also. Bad guys fall like dominoes, the ""good guys"" have some sort of invincibility force field around them. It was just a bad movie, I'm not sure why critics are praising it's plot is it new? no is it predictable? yes! Seems like a movie made for Call of Duty players generic action and the protagonist is so underdeveloped at the first start I felt bad for him cause he was in pain but minutes later I couldn't care any less what happened to him cause he was just the generic-action protagonist along with the generic ""beautiful girls"" (who I thought were cliche and overdone) The whole movie just falls apart. Mad Max has been ruined by Feminism. Most of the movie doesn't even have any meaningful plot it's all just ""OH LOOK EXPLOSIONS COOL!"" ""THAT GUY GOT SHOT AWESOME"" kind of narration that drives the entire film and I wish I was exaggerating. It's like Twisted Metal but in movie form and the special effects sometimes were irritating.  I couldn't feel like the protagonists were endanger at all because of how under powered the other guys were. I hope if there is a sequel it abandons this feminist-action hybrid formula and just focuses on action with an actual story and not old concepts added into a new adventure like this one did."

To me, this film is everything that is wrong with Hollywood films nowadays.  It's a 2 hour long car chase ... that's it.  There's barely a plot to speak with, what plot there is makes no sense because there is no backstory.  There's no reason for us to care about ANY of these characters: we don't know who any of them are or why they matter.  The reasons behind the entire chase ... which is the majority of the film... are barely touched upon.  I had to google to find out who Immortan Joe was, the breeders, the chroming, literally everything in the film because NONE of it was explained.  This is what passes for a film now.  Zero story, no character development, but if you throw in a whole lot of the right kind of action people just go nuts for it.  I'm seeing critics giving this film bonus points for not doing all the effects using CGI.  Whatever happened to writing guys?  Script? Plot? Dialogue? Do these things mean nothing anymore?  People call it the best film of the year: why?  How does this movie possibly merit praise that high?

Except the ludicrous over the top high octane purposeless 1 hour and 45 minutes of action sequences (This is something people apparently like?) it has nothing going for this lifeless shallow Best Picture nominee..... Ugh. This movie is probably the worst best picture nominee since god knows how long ago.

Let's face it, compared to the originals 2015's Requel/Seboot Mad Max: Fury Road is story wise disgraceful, because it barely has any, the only thing this movie does have is purposeless and lifeless action scene upon chase sequence upon explosions upon crazy characters and other ridiculous stuff, the story is non existence (The things they could've done in 2015 and with all the resources George Miller had available, they did this?!?), the characters are stail and bland, the performances were bad because it mostly consisted of stares and grunting, the dialogue it did have was kindergarten level laughable, and overall as a fan of the originals this was just a massive disappointment and a disgrace towards the Academy for nominating it 10 times.

Of Course i'm not here to solely hate, so what were the positive things?
The score was great (why wasn't this nominated), the costume/production design was impeccable, and the use of practical effects was sort of impressive.

As a final note, i've seen this movie once in the theatre, i liked half of it after that it got incredibly boring because it pretty much is a 1 hour and 45 minute car chase with cringe worthy moments in between because George Miller thought it should have at least SOMETHING of a dramatic element in this. I wanted to watch it again because of how high it was rated after looking it up on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. To my full surprised even Critics were raving about this. HOW?

As a fan of the original Mad Max movies, this was a tremendous disappointment.  As others have said, basically a two hour chase scene.  Yes, the vehicles and stunts are creative and impressive to look at and the director does a masterful job with all the visuals.  Still, the bare bones plot which exists is incomprehensible, and I'm familiar with the back story.  Can't see how you would have any idea what's going on without that prior knowledge.  While there is at least minimal character development with Furiosa, there is almost none for Max.  Neither actor does much acting, unless you consider endless angry, brooding looks as acting.  Check out The Revenant to see a fabulous current performance from Hardy, and Monster for an acting tour de force from Theron, then compare that work with this.  Seeing this movie garner 10 nominations made me think there must be something special, but now I'm just dumbfounded at the Academy voters."

The visuals were wonderful, the cinematography great, and the action was above average, for sure, but it takes more than that to make a great action film. See the aforementioned Road Warrior, Terminator 2 (or Terminator 1), Aliens, Predator, The Matrix. All those movies had gripping plots, intense suspense, good builds, great character development, in addition to amazing visuals and top notch action. All classics. People try to tell me that this movie was about 'visual storytelling'. Sure, it had that. But it was like a few tiny pieces of meat on a mostly bare skeleton.

This is bizarrely weird in any measure of the written word. Still, it’s just weird enough to gain full adoration of today’s ‘art society’ and the Academy!  Not to be missed - magnificent pretentious ambiguity cannot be denied its position in high creative circles. The treatment is too heavy to work as comedy and too weak for great drama. Just approach with caution if you seek entertainment grounded in a little more honest believability.  Daniel Day-Lewis may need to take another ‘last’ role - to atone for this lame foolishness no matter how technically perfect it all may be.  It’s interesting to find critic, Michael Woods revealing observations (London Review) as one of the only honest ‘stand-out-from-the-crowd’ assessments – just hope he doesn’t eventually accept membership into ‘the club’..."

I fall into the latter category (with the exception of The Master, which was a tightly made drama). While some of the cinematography is beautiful, the dialogue is painfully unrelatable and not written in a way that I have ever heard people speak in my lifetime. The performances hit the mark in that they achieve what PTA is going for, however  the characters are not compelling enough for you to invest your time and/or emotion in to. There is no character arc to speak of; tired old themes of mother issues are forced down your throat with no actual pay off. The story never really progresses until the final two minutes, and by that time you're left wondering why you have invested two hours of your time watching these horrible, uninteresting people."

Where are the dramas we used to love? Where is the soul? This was postmodernist garbage. Lazy, unimpressive writing.

**** is at the center of British fashion dressing royalty, movie stars, rich women and socialites with the House of Woodstock along with his sister Cyril (Lesley Manville) who manages the business and, to a certain extent, him. He is, and seems to boast about it, a confirmed bachelor and has women coming into his life and his sister getting rid of them when he is tired of them.

Taking a break he goes to his out of town cottage and in a restaurant, he meets a clumsy waitress, Alma, played by Vicky Krieps, starts dating her and she becomes his muse, lover and then wife. His falling in love with her disrupts his life and his work. As Cyril tells Alma her brother likes quiet in the morning, especially at breakfast, and she is noisy such as **** and cutting her toast, noisily pouring her tea and stirring her spoon just for starters.

Soon he is using all this ‘noise’ as excuses to end what they have and looking at his sister to do her job which is to send Alma away but then he gets sick and she takes care of him only endearing her to him.

At that point, I lost it. I lost what was going on. I lost interest in the film and Daniel Day-Lewis and the two women and the fashions but, also, where it was going if it was going anywhere.

When I got home I read three rave reviews to see what I had missed and one reviewer referred to Hitchcock’s “Rebecca”, another to Gene Tierney in “Dragonwyck” while another mentioned films made in the 1940s and 1950s and I could understand those references. The film starts with the song “My Foolish Heart” from the 1950 movie starring Susan Hayward and Dana Andrews, which was a favorite of mine and I wish I had seen that instead of “Phantom Thread” which takes place in the 1950s probably the reason for the song.

For the record it was announced today that “Phantom Thread” received the following Oscar nominations:  1) Best Picture 2) Best Actor 3) Best Director Paul Thomas Anderson 4) Best Supporting Actress Lesley Manville 5) Best Costume Design Mark Bridges and 6) original score Johnny Greenwind."

While it does get some chuckles from Daniel Day Lewis's formed character and delivery of some admittedly funny audacious dialogue he still should be embarrassed to have this pretentious fraud of a movie stand as his last before retirement.

I saw a 35mm film presentation of this which along with his preferred 70mm is the luddite director's pretentious carnival barker hoax of exhibition medium and it looked awful and was at unarguably less than half the resolution of current digital projection standards, like watching an old beat up film in the early seventies not in the great aesthetic sense of that period but in the deficient inferior movie theater technology of those times compared to now.

When the story depends almost entirely on the viewer's appreciation of a romantic love relationship between the two principal characters, then the key challenge for the writer and director (in this case the same person) is to find a way to convey the emotional content of that relationship to the viewer so that we may in some way connect and care – in the visuals, in the dialogue, in the music, whatever. In this, Pawlikowski has failed totally. The relationship depicted is opaque and impenetrable, occasionally capricious, often tedious, and always without the viewer caring one whit what might follow. And no amount of B&W, 4:3 arty cinematography or a 'powerful' soundtrack or 'inspired' acting can fix that flaw. I suspect Pawlikowski came to realise too late that he had no feel for the relationship (apparently it was based on his parents, which tells me all I need to know about the childish depiction of adult life) and so he was forced to construct an artful deceit to cover up his lack of insight. As a result, a movie that runs only 88 minutes was a chore to watch and entirely forgettable."

Le Hollandais volant sait encore en quelques scènes ici et là sans fard et sans fioritures nous estomaquer par la brutalité et l'agression (sexuelles bien sûr) ; il sait en extraire le côté scabreux le long d'une histoire qui s'y prête forcément.

This is his directorial debut and unfortunately for him and his audience, is a totally non-auspicious entry into the theatrical genre. Aided and abetted in this visual felony are actors John Cho and Haley Lu Richardson, with minimal participation by Parker Posey and Rory Culkin. The film takes place in Columbus, Indiana where many architectural feats have been accomplished and this serves as the basis for the common interest and attempted chemistry between its two co-stars. Although what well may have started out to be an effort to intellectualize and compare the world of architecture and life, the film fails miserably in that regard and becomes one of the most boring and tedious “entertainment” experiences this viewer can remember. As one member of the audience correctly put it: “It was like watching grass grow”. Mr. Cho manifests almost no emotion or credibility in the role he portrays in stark contrast to the performance of Ms. Richardson who is a delight to watch. Unfortunately, seeing her in the film is like listening to a fine singer performing a bad song. This is not a good film and one that I sincerely urge the potential viewer to avoid unless, of course, insomnia compels one to go to the theater for his or her much needed sleep. I give the film  a 2.0 rating and that is solely due to  the efforts of Ms. Richardson who hopefully will find better vehicles to expose her obvious talent."

Taking a cab ride in Cincinatti. Listening to a solo rendition of Girls Just Wanna Have Fun. In Cincinnati.

Granted I do not understand, nor am I attracted to, what is referred to as a ‘stop motion’ made with puppets film but a boring film is a boring film. You might be attracted to seeing anatomicaly correct puppets showing both male and female frontal nudity but you can go to an all night sex shop to see it.

“Anomalisa” is simply a story of a man, Michael Stone, who sees the whole world made up of robots, people who are and act alike, until he meets a woman, Lisa, who is a fan of this motivational speaker book writer, and seems to be a ray of sunshine in his gray world.

Aside from all the characters acting in one note they also speak in the same monotone voice except for Michael voiced by David Thewlis and Lisa voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh. All the other voices, whether male or female, child or adult, are voiced by one person, Tom Noonan.

GreatMartin

“The Death of Stalin” is set in the 1950s and the fight for power in Russia after the dictator’s death. Are you laughing yet? It supposedly is satire which implies irony or sarcasm and the director/writer, Armando Iannucci, tries everything from the Marx Brothers and the Three Stooges slapstick to insult comedy, chaos, no attempt at Russian accents having various accents ranging from Brooklyn to London but getting very few reactions from the audience.

Iannucci is the writer of the much awarded HBO series “Veep” known for its comedy, irony, and sarcasm which it delivers with belly laughs, smiles, smirks, and humor while here he enlists 2 additional writers and the only smile/laugh I can remember is a crack about Grace Kelly!

The cast consisting of Steve Buscemi, Michael Palin, Simon Russell Beale, Adrian McLoughlin, Jeffrey Tambor, Olga Kurylenko, Rupert Friend, Jason Issacs, Paddy Considine among others deliver the expected performances with a little scenery chewing now and then.

Enjoy seeing people shot in the head, brains taken out of a head after the scalp is cut back and ‘fun’ things like that? Can you go another day without knowing that most good doctors in Russia were killed and that Stalin had lists of people to be killed?

Those answering ‘yes’ to any of the questions asked should probably go and see “The Death of Stalin”.

The only questions I am asking myself is have I lost my sense of humor as I’ve grown older or is funny and/or satire not what it was defined years ago?"

ASTOUNDED. Pee **** Outhouse Endoscopy Missouri is very likely the very worst that mainstream ‘cinema’, or any ‘cinema’, has to ‘offer’. This is SO. INCONCEIVABLY. ABSOLUTELY. UNDENIABLY. REPULSIVELY AWFUL I genuinely believe that all parties involved despised their involvement with this offensively putrid refuse that they had to have done their utmost to burn it to the ground……and it won NOT ONE but TWO Oscars and best picture nom . Supposedly, tho even now I’m not sure I believe it. The sheer defeated agony on the actors’ faces and in their speech almost elicits some emotional response beyond intermittent, indignant, cackling laughter, confused and hateful exclamations of “What. the ****. IS THIS ****”, and sporadic bouts of involuntary bodily purging. The one thing I can sort of offer, in every interest (however labored) of demonstrating that this comes from a place of pure impartiality, is that there’s moments where it might have just qualified as a cult parody of comedic excellence had it not been so intent in claiming to be watchable, and so much of it being so inexcusably incoherent and purposefully horrible in an a truly angry way that the only thing a watch party might accomplish is a broken tv and an arson charge. I HAVE to know what happened. It wasn’t good from the start, but there’s a very clearly defined point where the screenplay turns from a not good movie to a barn fire, where every SINGLE, reducible instant and aspect of the dialogue, characters, acting, story, and even cinematography is solely for the intent of fulfilling an inside joke of decimating any semblance of a serious attempt to make a movie. I just need to know what happened to make everyone involved so incensed w the prospect of this trash heap seeing the light of day, who did it and why, so I can join the fan club, because clearly whoever this was targeting deserved it. For the likes of Francis, Sam, Lucas, Woody, and many more to find it absolutely necessary to jump ship from all professionality in favor of  angry sarcasm. Whoever it was better have deserved it, because I’m spite of the inexplicable awards showing, this psychological torture is undoubtedly effective. At least it’s the hardest I’ve laughed at a movie in a minute, and (god willing) I’ll not recover from the burns to my corneas so I won’t ever be made to subject myself to something so frighteningly and painfully grotesque ever again.

Note: I have never given a rating this low in my life, nor anywhere close. There’s maybe only a couple that got down to the 30’s in my 100 point scale, and even fewer to the 20’s. And I’ve rated THOUSANDS of films. Also keep in mind that all of the 20s-30s and most of the 40s are just bad kids movies. I do not dish out this criticism lightly"

Mais il n’en est rien, car on doit ce film de panneaux publicitaires à un autre gugusse en fait !

Même si Frances McDormand, excellente actrice au demeurant, a souvent joué pour les Coen, il est vrai et donne un vrai souffle à ce film qui s’avère en fin de compte une caricature totalement imbécile… à l’insu de son plein gré, bien sûr. Sans oublier le non moins excellent Sam Rockwell dans le rôle de ce flic bien taré (il collectionne les rôles décalés, il faut bien le dire, c’est même son fonds de commerce !).

Quoi qu’il en soit, on navigue ici dans les eaux troubles du pathos à deux dollars, un pathos poussé au maximum du ridicule… et de la caricature. Alors que ça se veut très « sérieux » et « grave »… avec pourtant quelques scènes d’un comique aussi inattendu que très appréciable du coup ! alors, on ne sait plus si c’est du lard ou du cochon…

En tout cas, ça se traîne un peu trop et les quasi-deux plombes peuvent en témoigner, Votre Honneur ! d’autant que c’est « illustré » par une espèce de musique country de chiottes qu’affectionnent les routiers avinés dans ce trou perdu du Missouri, ce qui rend le film bien pénible.

L’incrédulité domine ici sur tous les points, en compagnie du pathos sans nuance et des personnages pas crédibles non plus, lesquels font n’importe quoi et se retrouvent les uns les autres comme par hasard dans des situations téléphonées et pas crédibles pour deux centimes de dollar à crédit. Pas une vraie comédie, pas un authentique drame… ni un savant mélange des deux, ces « Panneaux de la Vengeance » se concluent de surcroît sur une pirouette encore plus ridicule que tout le reste.

Heureusement que quelques scènes sont drôles et que les comédiens assurent parce que sinon on aurait zappé cette connerie sans tambour ni trompette. La curiosité aidant, on le finit malgré tout… mais on aura vite oublié ce **** mouillé en définitive !"

With Francis McDormand heading up the cast you might expect the Cohen Bros may have been somewhere in the wings to push it along – in fact, this work offers many of the depressing earmarks of some lesser Cohen productions (maybe that’s partly why the Academy selected it?)   The overly sensationalistic mix contains all the ingredients that one could cram into a plot filled with a continuous succession of near-impossible coincidences (not to mention some perverse PC agenda pushing) With little or no character development and too many stretched situations - we are taken through a series of shocking actions that would land anyone committing just half of them, in jail or would have the local community after the perpetuator’s blood! - but no, our ‘hero ‘Francis violently assaults school kids, dentists, and near anyone she feels like with few saying little more than boo.  The local police (an unconvincing bunch of simplistic stereotypes) bash people near to death in broad daylight, and this is all taken as just another day in a town where every inhabitant tends to be on the edge of a mental meltdown. There’s basically no-one the viewer can emotionally identify with or support – unless they too, are on the loopy side of Mental Health Denial.  Add to the above, a lazy writer determined to create a swear fest - where all the foulest of outright mean language is paraded - in an attempt to out-shock any that’s gone before. This is somewhat juvenile trendiness in the extreme.

Any viewer bright enough to see beyond a manipulative piece of exploitation - will see this pretentiously overrated concoction for what it is. And for those who attempt to excuse this as “black humour” - it’s just so ‘simplistically’ dark as to be virtually invisible.  While it attracted a lot of people to the ticket box, it’s obvious from the Huge amount of viewer feedback - published here, etc; many of these audiences were bitterly disappointed and would like both their time and money back.

The director writer has a very odd and inaccurate view of America ans Americans. Cops throw people off a roof? Nothing happens to them. A woman goes to a school and kicks a couple of teenagers in the crotch in front of other parents? Nothing happens. Person gets horribly burned and in intensive care? A few days later he is hanging out in bars. Full of incongruent moments. Peter Dinklage as a gimmick character who is totally pointless to the plot or movie. Not as clever or as funny or as tragic or as real as it thinks it is. Lazy screenwriting, same old director tricks from his other movies. Was glad when it finally ended, it is a chore to sit through."

I suppose in a way Star is Born took a sardonic view of Ally's rise as a Beyonce-like starlet replete with back-up dancers doing a song somewhat reminiscent of Sing Ladies, but the world-weary Jackson let her play out her dream, ultimately escaping into a bottle of Tequila and **** the worm inside.

However, that was pretty much the only takeaway as far as I am concerned, as this film was loaded with cliches when it could have been tailored for the times.  Instead, it feels like a badly dated 1970s redux of the classic film with none of the joie de vivre we would expect from two headliners like Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper.

This is all her movie.  It is fun to watch Gaga raw and unplugged in the early scenes of the movie.  She has a great voice and is the obvious successor to Barbra Streisand.  But, Brad is no Kris Kristofferson, who could both act and sing.  Brad does neither very well.  He just falls further and further in the hole he has dug for himself one wasted scene after the next.

I would think we are beyond this kind of sentimental tripe but apparently not judging from all the glowing reviews.  The industry chews up and spits out these starlets one after the other.  No real comment on the system other than to give us the Faustian Rez Gavron who appears to call in Jackson's contract in favor of Ally.  Mercifully, Cooper avoids the love triangle that appeared to be coming, but ultimately Ally chooses Rez while hanging onto Jackson like you would an old dog.  Too bad because this film could have been so much more."

Dear Dave,

My name is Hank Mardukas. You probably don’t know me. I am but a longtime fan of your work. I have been a fan of yours since I first saw Half Baked in my college dormitory. As we watched you as Thurgood have a conversation with yourself as “Sir Smokes-a-lot”, I said to my roommate Seven, “That guy right there… He is going to be a star”. Sure enough, it was written in the stars. I am writing you today concerning a disturbing quote I read from you regarding your new movie A Star Is Born. I saw in an interview after a screening at The Toronto International Film Festival a couple months back, you were quoted as saying A Star is Born was the first “good ass movie” you’ve been in. I sir, vehemently disagree with your modest analysis of your underrated acting career.

In my very first issue of THE PURITAN POST, I reviewed one of my all time favorite movies, You’ve Got Mail. You can go read for yourself, if you’d like, Dave, highly recommend it. Issue No. 1 of THE PURITAN POST. In this issue, I talk about how your performance in that film is one of the main contributing factors to its success. That, along with fantastic performances from its two leads as well as a smart and timeless script by the late, great Nora Ephron. But I digress. My point is, Mr. Chappelle, that you shouldn’t sell yourself short in your acting career.

This isn’t a knock against A Star is Born. It’s only like the fifth Oscar-Baity remake of A Star is Born to come out in the last century. I feel like that’s not that many. Bradley Cooper is only mildly cringeworthy in it, and no, it doesn’t kill me at all that this is the movie getting him awards buzz after deserving Oscars for stirring and emotional turns in both Silver Linings Playbook and American Sniper. These things don’t bother me, Dave. They don’t bother me at all. You’ve Got Mail isn’t your only good ass movie in this writer’s opinion. The aforementioned Half Baked is stoner comedy gold. Your performances in Con Air and Robin Hood: Men in Tights are both scene stealers. Chi-Raq isn’t Spike Lee’s best, but it’s solid, as are you in it. Finally, a film you wrote and starred in, Dave Chappelle’s Block Party, directed by  Michel Gondry, I believe to be one of the best documentaries ever made. You see, Mr. Chappelle, your acting career is full of good ass movies. In fact, I would contend that you almost exclusively make good ass movies. That is, aside from A Star is Born. Thanks for reading, Dave!

 Sincerely, Hank W. Mardukas  Editor & Chief, THE PURITAN POST"

I naturally assumed the film would be a total vanity piece.  But then, it seemed to get universally great reviews – so I went to see it.  But, of COURSE.  I was absolutely RIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE.  This film is RUBBISH.  Bradley Cooper must have been feeling pissed not to be cast in deep and meaningful roles where he could also show off his ripped abs.  Or maybe he was upset that he’d never been cast as a Rockstar before.  Whatever.   Who the FRIG is Bradley Friggin Cooper that he can get this dross even made, let alone have people around the world say how great it is.  What is going ON??!

Cooper has made a point of claiming to have something to say in this film.  WRONG.  He has absolutely NOTHING to say in this film.  And, unfortunately, he says it at length (just like the Reverend at Harry and Meghan’s wedding).

In the scene where he wanders into the garage to hang himself, I thought I saw a gun on the table, so I was like Yeah, just shoot yourself instead – which made me laugh out loud.  Whoopsy.  This is supposed to be a portentous moment where he reverently lays down his cowboy hat before he chokes.   What a CROCK!

And I thought he might at least have the grace to leave the ending to Lady Gaga, but NOPE – he sticks himself right in there again!  Again!

Okay,maybe, just MAYBE, Ben Affleck has enough clout to get his film made, and even have it named best picture.  But BRADLEY COOPER?  Who the FRIG is HE?  Can someone please explain the inner workings of Hollywood to me again because I’ve clearly LOST THE PLOT.

I even took tissues to this thing – for NOTHING!!!
I want my MONEY BACK, PLUS the TWO HOURS I wasted on this self-indulgent drivel.

All the air seeps out after the first 15 minutes, and then it’s just two hours of watching the same beats over and over: Jackson promises to stop drinking, Ally belts out another forgettable song, Jackson falls off the wagon, Ally gets upset, they fight, repeat. Over and over and over. At first Ally has charm and charisma but soon enough turns into a vapid, one-note pop star with ugly day-glo hair. Inexplicably, Jackson mumbles throughout in a deep raspy vocal register but always sings in a tenor’s octave with choirboy diction. Ultimately the problem is Cooper’s love for his own unedited close-ups. He’s flipped the story’s dynamics so that he’s the star here, not the ascending starlet as in previous versions. And he’s simply not as fascinating as Cooper thinks he is. Never expected to find the cringeworthy Streisand version superior, but it is in just about every way. Her narcissism may be equal to Cooper’s, but at least the scenes in that version went somewhere, the dialogue wasn’t as banal and a handful of the tunes were hummable."

The main reason why I went to watch this is mainly due to the raving good reviews I have come across on this film. I normally steer clear of music central films. And I am excited to see Lady Gaga in action, being somewhat a fan of hers. Pretty much I went into this with relative high expectation.

The pacing of the film is slow. What is worse is that the story itself is a torture to watch through. It is so simplistic that I could predict how the film would end. This is really bad. Halfway through the film, I felt like leaving the theatre.

The only main good thing about this film is that the music are really wonderful and pleasing to listen to. But there are simply not enough of them in this film. It would have been better if the film focuses on making it more like a concert film, with mostly music performance and some light story in between.

I do not recommend watching this."

Gaga makes Madonna look like Meryl Streep. Also, why the hype over Bradley Cooper’s directing? It’s nothing special and he isn’t believeable in his role at all — I mean, if you want to look like a drug addict, change your physicality like the great actors are willing to do. DeNiro gained weight for Raging Bull, others lost weight to look ravaged by disease or drugs in their films, but Cooper thinks he can look like a drug addict with a perfect gym body and pristine looks.

Gaga can belt out a raspy song... but 'a voice from heaven' it is not.  The other observation is that this is LESS of a story about a star being born than it is a A Star is Dying.  Directed by Cooper, he focuses far too much on himself and the story from his POV and never get the sense of Gaga being star on the rise. She starts singing a song and then the film cuts to a scene about Cooper. Also, Gaga doesn't have ""it"" ... her sheer on-camera presence doesn't like up the screen, perhaps because she's so homely and doesn't have a spark that lights her up?

As one reviewer said, more 'A Star Goes Out' than 'A Star Is Born'. At least the self-indulgent focus on him spares us much of Gaga's precariously near-wooden acting. If Cooper was insistent on giving it the heavy-handed treatment he should have had the character's addiction stem from the pressures of fame and not from his family background. The resulting premise makes the music industry setting redundant. Subsequently, there is no palpable reason for tension between the leads, which makes for a very lacklustre experience. This might have been saved by a crackle of sexual chemistry but there is none. Cooper looks good without his shirt on but so what? Nobody wants to stare at those two weird faces for two and half hours. Some of the gruff-voiced dialogue is embarrassing (Sam Elliott, anyone?). Following in the unfortunate footsteps of 'Mother!' and 'Hereditary', it's unintentionally funny in parts and boring in others. The songs aren't bad but they're not in the same league as those from the 1976 version. Gaga's performance on the stage is, of course, good but not that good. She screeches out the songs from the beginning and consequently has nowhere to go for the denouement. Let's face it, she has about a quarter of Streisand's talent and none of the charisma. I can see the effort, but mediocre results. Next!"

The script cannot decide which story line to pursue and in attempts to converge them makes a mess.   It's really difficult to determine what is going on because they jump all over the place.  The writing and direction is terrible.  Certainly they could have come up with a better script for this mammoth production.   And the movie should have been identified for being insulting and offensive.  The CGI is laughable.  It's like he's jumping from this car to that and gets there with like one frame in between.   The action is not smooth and it's like he zaps from place to place.   I've played video games with better CGI.
I know people are offended far too easily but seemingly no where did I see critical thinking about how the movie's Black characters are portrayed.  The premise is a hidden society with technology so advanced it's almost Star Trek advanced.   Despite their supposedly being so advanced they choose a form of government from the dust bins of history.  The absolute monarchy.    They choose their absolute ruler by combat to the death.  Indicating that they are not advanced at all.  Any society that did that would end up with vicious dictators who are insane.   Their ""modern"" country is like Mad Max Thunderdome.   And the fact that Wakandans are not smart enough to discover the values of elective democracy and representative government makes one think that all that vaunted technology was dropped by space aliens into the laps of complete idiots.  Wakanda is populated by competing tribes seemingly ready to latch onto each others' throats.  Such a society would never coalesce long enough to build such a technologically advanced nation.  They would have been too busy killing each other.
And this rare substance that appears no where else in the world?  First of all scientists will tell you that is impossible.  Secondly, it would have been all over the world like cocaine.  The most valuable contraband possible and no mass smuggling?  Come on.  That one really insulted my intelligence.  And what about the behavior of these black people?  They act like a bunch of war- like primitive savages dancing around with spears in native garb in a frenzied tribute to racist movie stereotypes.  Perhaps Wakandans were not allowed to watch satellite television and therefore never discovered shorts, slacks and T-shirts like the rest of Africa.  Or how guns have won every war for over three centuries.  How stupid are Wakandans?  They deliberately dress uncomfortably and bring spears to a gun fight.    Like old Hollywood of the Jim Crow era Black Panther is in the sad tradition of presenting Black Africans as vicious simpletons.   Wakandans are so advanced socially they know how to ride a rhino like a horse.   And they yell real good when they're killing each other.  So what's next for the writers of ""Black Panther?""  Perhaps they would be perfect for the modern re-make of ""The Emperor Jones."""

And It's the highest-rated of all Marvel cinematic universe movies.
And honestly - it's a boring, cliche-ridden dullness.
And now that I've seen it, I have a theory as to why it's so overrated:
It's a correctional bias. Over-exaggerated political correctness. People are rating this movie highly, simply because it is the only all African American Marvel movie.
The plot itself is somewhat good. The acting is somewhat good. But the directing suffers from excruciatingly cringe-inducing exaggerated African accent.
I was unconvinced by the ridiculous mixture between Yoga, African tribalism, and technology. It's a bizarre line to thread - one that simply does not mix well.
Tribes are our past. Technology, modern sciences - all of these have eradicated tribalism, simply because that is the way of society. Attempting to create a convincing world of a ""technologically-superior tribe"" is simply ridiculous.
The movie tries to keep reminding us that these are ""tribes"" people, and all this mixture simply does not go down well.
From an honest, purely emotional perspective, the majority of other Marvel movies are blessed with much better moments than this one.
This is a ridiculous occurrence, in my opinion - if there were more than only-one African-American superhero, then this movie would see its deserving Metascore of 5. Anything more than five is, in my opinion, trying to make up for the fact that - there are no other African-American superhero-centered movies from Marvel.
And honestly - that's a shame, because indeed Marvel's superheroes tend to be White Males - in their vast majority.
This movie should serve as an eye-opener - but this doesn't mean it should be so highly praised. Lying to ourselves just further occludes the truth. It never really helps."

An 87!!!  The glacial pace of this movie, the plot that can be summarized in 2 sentences, that we watch someone take a crap for a full minute (and that crap scene has no relation to the plot-I guess it sets the mood-yeah, that this movie is a piece of crap) and this movie gets an 87!  How do you take a 10 minute idea and turn it into a 2 hour film, watch this film and you'll see.  That this film gets an 87 reminds me of going to an art exposition and seeing a red circle painted inside a blue rectangle and the painting is covered with awards and the critics say it is the work **** (and even then you wouldn't spend 2 hours looking at it - you just shake your head and walk away).  The critics speak of this film as being subtle, authentic, mesmerizing, time shifting.  Then I guess waiting in line for 2 hours at the DMV is a wonderful experience too.  I don't mind subtitles.  I enjoy thoughtful films. I don't need a car crash in a film for it to work for me.  But this film gives me nothing. I can't wait for the director's cut, maybe I'll get to see three different scenes of people taking a crap.  No, probably not, this film gives the impression that nothing was left on the cutting room floor.  After 45 minutes of watching this film I figured that with an 87 score the movie would get better, that there would be some payoff, wrong!  The only payoff available from this movie will be if there is a class action lawsuit to compensate anyone that lost two hours of their life to watching this movie.  I guess you could say that I just didn't get it. In my mind it is a zero, but I gave it a 1 because some of my disappointment is probably due to the fact that I had high expectations due to the 87 score."

However, this movie has in my view been really overrated. Its very generic, by-the-numbers story relies completely on coincidence to drive events, rather than any stirrings or initiative on the part of the heroine, creating an artificial set of ironies and dilemmas and a weirdly lifeless, schematic, almost embalmed feeling. All of the characters and settings are utterly one-dimensional. Eilis's beloved mother hardly talks, her sister is a tragic saint, her best friend cute and sweet, the woman she works for is an evil witch. Eilis herself for that matter seems like a complete cipher--a person that things simply happen to. In America, her new boyfriend Tony is pure-hearted and noble--period. The streets of Brooklyn are nearly empty and completely devoid of danger or even texture. Even the Italian family dinner that Tony takes Eilis to is weirdly subdued--out of six people, including three young adult brothers, who in any real family would be talking over each other and teasing each other, the only person who says anything--literally, anything--is their precocious, wise-ass 8-year-old kid brother. Screenwriter Nick Hornsby is a clever writer, but I think he probably could do just so much with this story (I tried reading the novel and gave up--it came off like a young-adult novel and was just not an interesting read.). There are a couple of good moments where a moment of spontaneous life fizzes into being despite the labored artificiality, but these are extremely few and far between. Worth seeing for the nice photography and Ronan's lovely open face and expressive ice-blue eyes--as long as you keep your expectations low for much more than that."

But subtext is important in media, especially ones geared towards family consumption.

Unfortunately the entire plot is firmly cemented upon the popular and lazy reframing of colonialism and patriarchy. Unnecessary cheap shots abound - Christianity, authority figures, patriarchy, fatherhood, hunting, woodcutting, (work in general), townspeople, but mostly just men, are villains of this story, while the wild woods people and their pack of wolves can do no wrong.

As usual in these movies (just look at three decades of Disney), the parental figure, usually the father, is a poor listener, and has to learn his lesson of not being so protective, and the child is always right to think and act according to their impulses. These movies snidely poke fun at the family unit and tempt our children to remove themselves from the family's way of thinking and protective influence. That's a firm no from me.

Another decent movie spoiled by woke-ism."

With a cast lead by Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman based on play by August Wilson, I was prepared for greatness but was disappointed.  The main reasons this film didn’t succeed was due to the direction and screen adaption of the play. There were several films this year based on plays but Ma Rainey was the one that failed to translate to the screen.

Boseman was engaging, he along with the band members were the most interesting part of the film. With no disrespect, Boseman’s performance felt stagey as if he was trying to convey a major scene by emoting louder and faster. I thought I accidentally missed Davis’ scenes because she was hardly in the film. I believe in quality over quantity but even with that consideration her role didn’t make a lasting impact I would expect from a leading role. And Davis’ lip syncing didn’t help her performance. I realize the sense of claustrophobia in the band room is to reflect society’s oppression but overall the film felt stunted and never fully realized."

His acting here is still pretty good, but his character is not inspirational at all and he doesn't resemble a real character, a real person, he actually feels like a caricature as all of the characters in ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"". Even Ma Rainey, who was an actual person and not a fictional character as the rest of them, feels like a caricature despite Viola Davis' amazing performance. Unfortunately it's not easy to adapt a play into a movie and as a film, ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" is subpar, lacking a good script, solid characters, actual build-up, focus, any essence at all. I mean, what was the point after all? The emotion is there in some scenes, but it doesn't lead anywhere and in that regard, those scenes feel pointless in the end. And this film isn't even about the music as some people might think. Not at all actually! This isn't even a proper antiracist movie.

The film is a jarring mixture between documentary and fiction. It's set in a part of the United States where poverty forces people into nomadism. This seems sad on the surface because it makes you work in unglamorous jobs and live in your car (that's probably the documentary part of the film?). But it's really the best thing ever (which is probably the fiction?). You constantly meet really great and warm people and form deep relations of mutual gratitude. Being a nomad you end up having to leave, but since they are also nomads you bump into them everywhere. Some of them are not so good at sounding profound, but it doesn't get worse than that, and they only try this maybe two or three times in the film. The hardest part in keeping up this lifestyle seems to be turning down the rich people who constantly offer to house you for free. Maybe this is a particularly privileged part of the US. That would explain why there are no black people to be seen anywhere.

This could still be a good fiction if it actually managed to bring the human stuff to life, but this did not work at all for me. In the least convincing scene of the film Fern suddenly becomes judgemental out of nowhere. The writers follow this up with a scene where Fern's sister praises here ability to ""cut through **** Having served its purpose as an attempt of giving weight to the relation between the sisters, this aspect of Fern's personality promptly vanishes from the story. Also: is this an ad for Amazon?"

It *almost* has a point of view, but the director cuts it off from doing any of these things every time. It has a vast landscape shots, but honestly, a lot of it wasn't ""beautiful"" just... vast and empty and untouched landscape.  There's no story, certainly no ""plot"" to follow.  Someone accidentally breaking her plates was perhaps the most striking moment in the whole thing.  Or maybe... oh no! drama! the main character might be getting ill?!?!  No, she just has an upset tummy, for no reason hinted before nor explained after.

And these nomads, carefully un-judged by the film-maker, portrayed as neither down-and-outs (""I'm not homeless, I'm houseless"") nor heros, are on one hand free to wander the huge distances of America, yet unable to afford a spare tire.  Somehow able to get instant, same-day keyhole surgery in America without any concern for cost, but desperate for a discount because they don't use electricity at the RV park.

It kinda looks realistic, but was also completely unrealistic.

The cinematography, acting and music all seem to make it emotional, but the lead character who we follow minute by minute had no inner life, despite tragedy.

Way, way overrated."

Nothing inspiring here, nothing to hold onto or that gives hope. Just a miserable, self-pitying woman wondering around bleak landscapes to sombre piano music. Even the homes she enters seem bereft of joy or life. It was painful to endure. The Director would probably say 'then it served it's purpose.' Gee, thanks mate..."

In the process she has 2 expressions: quiet and sad, and quiet and grimacing. This, of course, gets old rather quickly.

Then we have the dramatic technique of having real people (non-actors) stepping into the script. This makes for 2 possibilities: the director gives them 1 line to memorize and they recite it in a monotone, or they tell their sad story to the camera. The latter is fine and would be much better in a documentary. `"

I'm a Frances McDormand fan so I thought, well, lets see what she's up to. Five minutes in I realized I was watching a fictional account of a non fiction book. ( I had no idea that the film was structured that way).  This left me disturbed, annoyed and bit confused . I kept on thinking, why not make this a true documentary with Frances McDormand BEING Frances McDormand and interviewing these wonderful ""Nomads' who live their lives on the fringe of society. I understand how some people see this film as a milestone or a real triumph in character study, but I saw it as a bit of a manipulative exercise in taking real peoples stories and fictionalizing them for the aggrandizement of I can't imagine who. I won't get into the acting because the real people were so much more engaging than the stars, and that was the problem. The directing was at the best description adequate but nowhere near the skills et of someone like Aaron Sorkin, or Emerald Fennell who really created something amazing and impactful with ""Promising Young Woman"". I don't want to take anything away from Ms. Zhao. it takes a lot to get any film made, but in this case, I felt like a nomad myself, wandering between scenes trying to find an emotional truth to what she saw and portrayed onscreen. If this was a true documentary I believe it would have had a lot more impact. As a vehicle for Hollywood stars it fell far short of its intended emotional impact for me."

Frances Mcdormand had taken up more challenging roles in the past, and this isnt even near to her best. Finally, this film must be released immediately to the global audience instead of travelling through and garnering festival fever. Only then, can Nomadland be truly judged for its forgettable film-making."

In a word it is dull... There is fantastic acting by all involved, but the story is just so completely non existent, that I can't fathom how any reviewer could rate this movie positively. I felt it my duty as a movie lover to warn people considering watching this, as there are (inexplicably) only positive reviews of this movie."

It is one of those movies I got **** into seeing by word of mouth from movie reviewers of which there seem to be 3-4 every year, not some much from the actual reviews as I very seldom read reviews before I go to see a movie. There was the fact that it played at Sundance and magazines like Entertainment Weekly picked it as a winner and Hollywood Reporter stated ‘a strikingly intimate look---in an outstanding debut film” so off to the movies I went.

It could be that I have forgotten what a teenager is like or the fact that I was never a female teenager and/or that a male teenager losing his virginity isn’t that big a deal but except for a few startlingly incidents like the boyfriend, at 35, of the girl’s, at 15, mother is the one that loses her virginity, that she is shown in full frontal nudity (though in real life she, Minnie, played by Bel Powley, was 21 when it was filmed) along with many sexual scenes from lesbian shots, to teenage girls performing oral sex on teenage boys, the movie is pretty boring and I think it only appeal to teenage girls, maybe some women and voyeurs!

Reading a half of dozen reviews after seeing the movie it seems many give Alexander Skarsgard a pass on having sex with a minor and seem to ignore the fact that all the females, except Minnie’s younger sister, are pretty loose with the sex and drugs including her mother  played by Kristen Wiig, her best friend Kimmie, Madeleine Watres,  a young lady, Margarita Levieva, into gay sex and drugs in all forms.

Surprisingly the only off key acting is by Christopher Meloni who plays Minnie’s father, who lives in New York. I found Wiig and her female friend to be annoying while Bel Powley playing the teenager experiencing her sexual coming out is convincing and off kilter at the same time.

Directed by Marielle Heller, who also wrote the screenplay based on a novel by Phoebe Gloeckner, seems to add some of the  “Birdman” fantasy plus more, shows San Francisco in a good light, also the good and bad of 1979, with many illustrations to add a comic book angle including many a Disney touch and a drawn Aline Komisky-Crumb who ’helps’ Minnie.

This is a movie I came very close to walking out on but stayed hoping it would redeem itself but, for me, it didn’t."
