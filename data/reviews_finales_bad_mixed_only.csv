It sought to do what no previous film had ever attempted, that being filming the actors over several years as they grew rather than trying to cast others who looked similar at various ages. That in and of itself is a remarkable feat. However, like many films that try to accurately emulate what real life is like, this story didn't have much of a plot. It is understandably difficult to have an overarching theme when trying portray the life and struggles of an adolescent boy. That is perhaps why this particular film seemed to wander significantly. There were a couple of really good scenes and a few powerful lessons that one could take away from this motion picture, but simply good scenes, unfortunately, do not make a good movie."

Richard Linklater delivers a boring, gimmick of a movie with next to no redeeming qualities.

There's a lot of ham fisted scenes: such as the domestic abuse scene, which felt rushed and on the nose. As someone who's experienced this I can tell you that it's the most generic domestic violence ever put to film.

Another thing wrong with this film is how long and boring it is. The film has nothing that makes you keep watching. The main character, I did not like- I thought he was a bit of an ass and I didn't care about the supporting characters (except Ethan Hawk).

Speaking of Ethan Hawk, he's by far the best part of the film next to the cinematography and shot composition. It's a technically well made film, but it's boring as hell.

If you'd have took about 30 minutes off of the run time, it might have been digestible. But no, it's long, drawn out and pretentious.

Linklaters director is noting to get hype about its fine. Nothing worse nothing more.

The script was okay but could feel a bit cheesy at times.

Overall this is a boring, unmemorable and unrewarding experience that doesn't deserve most of the praise it's getting."

I still thought it was a good movie that require some effort and i appreciate that. I like it as a journey of growing up with some relatable things and nostalgic events, but other than that it was EXTREMELY FLAWED. A lot of things that happened through the first half and second half were really underdeveloped and If you think about it, it doesn't make sense and you end up seeing it as a mess. The screenplay was good but some parts of it were really forced and written in a poor and unfocused way just to give sense to the scenes. I was expecting the script to be as amazing as the one in the ""Before trilogy"" (directed by Linklater), but it wasn't that good. If the screenplay was like ""Before Sunset"" the movie would be an epic masterpiece, but sadly it wasn't. It is really sad, because in both movies (Boyhood and Before Sunset) there is a huge dependence on the script and that's because it doesn't happen that much on the story of both films. Before Sunset worked really great but Boyhood not so much. I was entertained by it and it's concept was interesting, but it is difficult for me to see it as one of the best movies of 2014."

I have male children; I know what they think and do during pre-adolescence, adolescence and post-adolescence.  Let's face it, men aren't complicated creatures whether they're children or adults.  Watching 2 hours and 46 minutes of it was pure torture.  I'm only giving it a 4 because Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are great.  Although, I've seen Patricia do better in ""Medium"".

There's one dramatic scene, which doesn't even tie into any kind of overarching plot or theme or development, and one decent performance (Hawke).

I don't care much about the 12 years of real time either, because it only added so much in the overall experience. I would prefer more focused and interesting story-line instead.
That being said, it is hard to predict how every other spectator would precept it and from what angle. But one thing, I am quite certain of, is that it dragged too much for what could be much shorted and more eventful tale. The ending was kind of charming though."

With a 2 hours 45 minute run time, the film is much too long.  I can only surmise that director Richard Linklater became so personally invested in the film that he was unable to leave anything on the cutting room floor.

The film is a story is about the life of an adolescent boy, Mason (Ellar Coltrane) and his slightly older sister, Samantha (Lorelei Linklater).  You get to watch them grow up from about age 6 until they leave home for college.  Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke play their divorced parents.

Throughout his boyhood, Mason is subdued and reserved.  There are no milestones in his life to celebrate, no tragedies to mourn, no joyous moments, no outbursts of anger; just long periods of monotonous existence.  His life is like that of a rubber duck on a river.  He simply goes where the river of life takes him. The currents and eddies periodically trap him and then take him further downstream.  I waited in anticipation for fate to intervene, for tragedy to strike, for something - anything - to happen!  Instead, watching Mason evolve into an adult was sort of like watching paint dry.

The lives of Mom, Dad and Sister are equally unsatisfying to watch.  Samantha has a bigger, naturally ebullient personality, than her brother but the film focuses almost exclusively on Mason and we end up knowing almost nothing about her life.

Dad cares about his kids but is a late bloomer and, at least initially, is pretty rough around the edges when it comes to parenting.  He sees his kids on weekends, tries hard to engage them in conversation, and gives them the kind of talks that you would expect from a Dad in a movie like Sixteen Candles.  The speeches come across as odd because Dad lives with a professional musician in a dirty apartment complete with empty beer bottles, cigarette butts and a little drug paraphernalia.  Thus, his words are completely incongruent with the life that he lives.

Mom’s life is like a twisted version of Ground Hog Day.  She goes back to college, begins dating her professor and ends up marrying him.  Over time he becomes an angry alcoholic.  Mom leaves him and moves the kids to another part of Texas.  Mom then becomes a community college professor, starts dating one of her students, and ends up marrying him.  Rinse and repeat.   Ultimately, Mom ends up alone and, as Mason leaves for college, wonders if this is all that life has to offer.

Minutes after Mason arrives at college he meet a girl, takes a mind altering drug, goes on a hike, watches the sun set, and realizes that he is happy.  The ending is a lot like nouvelle cuisine at a highly popular restaurant:  The wait is too long and what arrives on the plate is too little to be truly enjoyable."

A touch of mass hysteria for a movie that is really just a cool version of reality tv. All just too ordinary. Birdman has far more going for it. Boyhood is way too long and gives us very little to ponder other than we have all been there. There are so many better things to do with 2 hours and 45 minutes.

We all have friends growing up who we drift apart from. Over the course of this movie, I went from really enjoying spending time with young Mason, to cringing while watching an older Mason who I could never even stand to be in a room with.

Not everyone will have this reaction, but this guy's personality when he gets older is insufferable to the point that I wish I could slap him. As a boy, his experiences are some that any boy/man could relate to. As a young adult, he becomes smug and whiney and almost regressed to a teenage state.

That being said, this was a very ambitious project by Linklater with a lot of really great material early on, and a couple of great performances by Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke. During the actual ""Boyhood"" segment of the movie, I felt like I could watch it all day. From high school on I continued watching because I felt I had to having invested so much time in it."

Want to see a great film about boyhood? See This Boy's Life.
Want to see Ethan Hawke's best? See Predestination.
Want to save 3 hours? Skip Boyhood.

I loved Before Sunset, Sunrise, and Midnight. But Boyhood is not good.

DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE.

Boyhood gets attention for the gimmick of being filmed sporadically over 12 years, so you get to see the kids in the movie grow up. Big whoop. Not an ounce of Hollywood gloss here. The movie goes for realism in the extreme. Homes are dirty, kind of crappy and depressing. It also passes over obvious places other movies would go; it skips cliches. No the step dad does not try to sexually abuse his step daughter. Which was a breath of fresh air. But it also crosses a line of being too realistic in terms of having no real plot. For awhile there IS kind of a plot as the mother deals with a difficult domestic drama. But after that the film sprawls. Example. The dad (minor spoiler, nothing big; probably you'll read about it in any review) seems not entirely to have reached closure with his ex. Maybe is considering getting back with her? But suddenly the movie cuts; it's years later; the dad is with another woman and has had a baby with her. I don't know about you, but between those cuts there might have been some good drama, but it's just skipped. Despite the title, the film dwells on every family member, so it's not like Ethan Hawke is a minor character. Yet they pass over a giant life event.

Minor spoiler is now over.

Yes stories should flow from character, but there should still be a story. Character reveals itself through the crucible of a crisis. Aside from the drama early on with the mom's domestic issue, there is no crisis here, and no story. When Hitchcock was asked what he thought of slice-of-life stories, he said he preferred to give people a slice of cake. I left this movie hungry for that cake. And besides, so-called slice-of-life stories, the good ones, do have a crisis. It's just that it's subtle. We didn't get that here.

There is no depth of the boy's life plumbed here. Just sketchy skit-like scenes semi-related.

Another point. Aside from Ethan Hawke, no one in this movie seems to have a positive attitude about anything ever. It's one thing not to be Disney, but this movie mistakes chronic maudlin negativity for drama. A story requires conflict. But much of the activity in this film doesn't rise to the level of actual conflict. Instead it's just a manifestation of some kind of low grade depression that never quits and slowly grinds down the teeth on the gears of your spirit.

Even though the movie is too realistic, in other ways it is too unrealistic. There is oddly stilted fake sounding dialog in the first 20 minutes or so. Also, the son (the ""boy"" of the title) encounters adult men who act exactly the same toward him all the time, step dad, teacher, boss, all of them criticize him in exactly the same way, and that's all they do. You could switch out the dialog for all these guys. They are all the same. Except Ethan Hawke. Another unrealistic thing. When the boy finally lands a girlfriend, she just happens to be one of the most beautiful women you've ever seen in a movie. This pimply pug nosed boy, without athleticism, brilliance, money, or particular promise, gets a girlfriend who probably would have thought herself too good for a young George Clooney. It's ridiculous. And they were going for extreme realism?

In my own life growing up I encountered some real weird ****. So did friends. They say '**** happens' for a reason. But if this is supposed to be this kid's life, either they skipped over that type of dramatic stuff or he had one heck of a mundane childhood! Also, these people seem to have no center. If they have values or principles or beliefs, that's skipped over too. There is some banter that might try to be passing for philosophy but it amounts to nothing of substance. Yes as an adult paying bills and just trying to survive, you don't go around espousing basic values every day of your life, but these people seem so empty inside, as if they are animals that just happen to be able to speak. There's something off-putting about them from my perspective. They are not like people I have ever known.

Ethan Hawke does a good job acting in Boyhood, but why did he agree to do it? Predestination, his other new movie, is sci-fi, but it's also a study of character as revealed and developed through a protagonist's response to a crisis. It is stellar, brilliant, the best of the best. I am chalking it up on my list of the very best films (of any genre) that I have seen. It will be right beside Before Sunset on my BLU Ray shelf. Predestination raised Ethan Hawke in my estimation, and even Boyhood, which I saw a short time later, cannot bring him down entirely. So let me divert you dear reader. See Predestination. Skip Boyhood"

The Good: I have to admire the ambition. It takes a lot of guts and vision create a film piece by piece over a 12 year span and I have to give Linklater credit there. Overall, the film is well acted and the characters are at least somewhat interesting. Ethan Hawke turns in the best performance of the film and newcomer Ellar Coltrane improves drastically as the film progresses. At times, ""Boyhood"" starts to head down a very entertaining path and you can briefly (albeit very briefly) see why it was nominated for Best Picture.

The Bad: But then, once it heads down that path, it does an about face. Time suddenly passes in the film and the previous storyline is an afterthought. At 2:45 the film is also extremely long and it feels it. There are far too many gaps where nothing happens and you feel like you're just watching the life of a regular every day family. Maybe that is the point, but it doesn't make for a very compelling film. Slow moving and with a highly unsatisfactory ending, ""Boyhood"" might be among the most overrated films of all time."

I knew going in that this movie would have a hard time living up to it's reputation (universal acclaim), but it didn't even come close.
The idea is fantastic, but the execution wasn't. Some of the acting was mediocre at best, especially the sister (who it turns out is the director's daughter). [Note to directors: Ad-lib dialogue is really challenging, and if is not done right it's pretty terrible].
The story line left a lot to be desired - it didn't feel natural.
This was a great idea that could have been so much more, but one cool concept can't carry a movie.
It's still worth seeing, just don't expect the movie of the year or anything close."

I also fell asleep during 3/4 of the movie, so I had my mom explain the rest of the almost non existent plot.

But when I finally watched it, I thought the film was aimless for the most part. I worried this might be the case when I learned that the movie didn't have a set story and adapted itself to the lead actor's real-life experiences as it went along. My worry turned out to be true: it's basically just a bunch of unrelated events clumsily put together. I don't think even Linklater himself knew where the movie was going, until maybe the very end. I felt like the movie was wandering a lot. At the end of the day, I believe that the 12-year-long filming thing was mostly a gimmick.
Some people might argue that the very fact that there is no point in this movie is the good thing about it because the movie is life itself. Well, I'd rather watch a movie that has a clear beginning, middle, and end and actually knows where it's headed, because my own life is enough for a lifelike experience so to speak.
And another thing, I thought the movie was trying too hard with its political agenda. Sure, filmmakers can incorporate their politics into their work. But it only works when their political views are carefully interwoven with other things, which isn't the case in this film. And I'm a liberal like Linklater so that's saying something.
That said, I think Patricia Arquette gives an Oscar-worthy performance in the movie. She really saved the film for me.
I wouldn't necessarily call this a bad film, but it certainly doesn't deserve the hype and praise it currently gets."

A true epic, from the breath-stealing long shots of an unimaginably vast desert to the explosive, well-outfitted battle scenes, it lives up to the billing and then some. I was mesmerized by the photography in particular, which constantly discovers new ways to portray what could have been a rather redundant, flat, boring landscape. Truly beautiful, almost ruminative at times, with an appreciation for the artisanship of film.

As for the plot, well... it's a bit slow. Particularly so in the nearly four-hour director's cut, which feels completely unnecessary. I've never seen the theatrical release, which is noted for being incomprehensible in places due to the awkward cuts, but it seems suspicious that half an hour or more couldn't have been lopped off somewhere to improve the pace. Lawrence of Arabia is an exhausting watch, and not just because of the draining personal transformation we see in the title character. There's good material, of course, plenty of it. The hopeless inner squabble of an Arab population that's desperately close to the unified independence they seek. The protagonist's progression from philosophical humanist to enraged berzerker to **** shell. We get plenty to think about, long after the credits have finally, mercifully rolled, but it's a marathon to reach that point.

A Best Picture winner that's technically marvelous, thematically challenging and open-minded, but the ending left me feeling cold and there's really no excuse for it to run for as long as it does."

You should not expect an adventure story as many sites list it, instead you will find the rest are true; a Biography War Drama. A perfect comparison to this story is the movie: 'The Ten Commandments'. An extremely long look at a piece of history. This film fails as a solely entertaining experience. If you do not want to know this piece of (biased)history then don't watch this movie. I watched this because it was voted top Adventure movie in many places, but I would not call this an adventure, more a biography as stated before. There is no structure to make this an interesting and exciting story, just a historical retelling with only its events as pacing, making it slow and unsuspenseful.
It certainly didn't need the extra hour and a half it took, but lacking any structure they decided to show everything they had and cut nothing.

Overall I liked the movie despite the score, but it certainly is no adventure movie or anything worth 3 and a half hours unless you're into movies like the ten commandments. Look to other movies for entertainment, especially in the adventure category."

I mean, I know a few things about the Resistance.  I've read a few things about the Resistance.  I admire these people for their courage and sacrifice.  But this film does little or nothing at all to illuminate their accomplishments.

Very early in the we meet a character who claims to be a traveling salesman.  He says he was arrested because he happened to be walking through a square or plaza just as a riot or something erupted.  And this could well serve as the epitaph for most of the characters in the film, who do little besides smoke cigarettes and talk about who was just arrested and who might be arrested next.

You'd think that given two hours and twenty-five minutes of footage someone might've found the time to film a raid or two or maybe some sabotage.  You'd think they could get deeply into the characters so that the audience get to feeling a little invested in what's happening on the screen.  You'd think, if this film is such a masterpiece, that a little suspense or excitement might be building by the time we pass the one hour mark.  But you'd be wrong.

The film is as flat as a pancake.  The characters are cardboard.  The action is almost non-existent.  And if the French didn't like it . . . well, what more need be said?"

Then I immediately understood that it works like a dream - with sudden changes in setting as well as emotional turns. As a vivid dreamer, I can usually tell movies that are designed after dreams. For example, David Lynch's movies most definitely are. Quite often, traumatic events trigger mystical dreams (or series of dreams), and Pan's Labyrinth successfully visualizes one of those. As a mystical dream, it is enormously captivating - but as such, it also lacks cleverness.
The most interesting statement this movie *could* make, I would argue, is this: Good and Evil do only exist in fantasy. Although reality (including love and violence) spans some extreme moments, it cannot be divided like that. Reality is complex, its events do not follow that logic, and injustice will often go unpunished - while Good and Evil remain concepts of literature, an attempt to provide some solace. That being known beforehand, this film has not much to say. It does offer a dream."

I am a fan of fantasy; even at my ripe age, The Wizard of Oz is my favorite movie. But in Pan's Labyrinth, the character of the captain was so over the top as to be annoying, not really evil. That the mother could be in love with him, or even just using him for security, sex, etc. was simply not believable. On the other hand, Miss Gulch and the Wicked Witch were believable.

I am still baffled that a talented filmmaker like  Del Toro could leave me so flat, and that many others give this move such high ratings.

On one side, we have an overly simplistic caricature depiction of the horrors of the civil war, punctuated by hamfisted moments of hyper violence, that border on pedantry and textbook shock tactics.
This serves as the backdrop of the story of a young girl who, having lost her father, is forcibly ""adopted"" by a laughably sadistic Franquist general, who has taken her mother as his new wife.

As the story progresses, she, the sensitive innocent soul, wonders off into rather unimaginative adventures that she believes, are real. As expected, her adventures get her into a number of problems with his adoptive father, who chews the scenery through the whole production.

Possibly one of the bluntest, less subtle and most unrefined approaches to both children's fantasies and historical/political war drama that I have ever seen.

Slashed by nearly an hour for its original western release, trimmed further by **** censors in 1936, color tinted and re-edited in the '80s (with a modern rock soundtrack) by Giorgio Moroder, then painstakingly restored for Blu-Ray in 2010, using lost footage from an old print in Buenos Aires. Up until now, my entire memory of the film comes from the Moroder version, which didn't make much sense from a story perspective but always wowed me with its wild, futuristic visions, ambitious special effects and expansive set designs.

The restored version offers improvement in both respects. Now cast in gorgeous monochrome, as intended, the art direction is even more stunning. New scenes and high-resolution scans give us fresh opportunities to admire the sprawling city, to really soak up the vast scale of Lang's concept. And the plot, naïve and airy as it may be, actually moves in sensible directions now. It's incredibly slow moving and drawn-out, sure, overloaded with long shots of talking heads (which seems unnecessary for a silent picture) but at least it's headed somewhere.

As a long-time fan of the film, I'm glad to have finally seen the full thing. Metropolis is an iconic marvel, an artistic triumph that's, somehow, just as hypnotic now as it must've been in post-WWI Germany. That said, wading through the scenes without some sort of huge, dazzling art deco set piece, well, it can feel like work. I needed four sittings to get through this two-and-a-half hour behemoth, and I was already personally invested before it hit my media shelf. First-timers will, no doubt, find it smothering. Deeply influential as a production, astounding as a purely visual showpiece, but critically flawed as a whole. Now excuse me while I revisit a few tunes from the 1984 release."

The amount of trouble the restorers went through to bring this to us is still absolutely astounding to me. For that reason alone, I'd say it's more than worth a watch.

The film is about an aging gangster called Tony le Stephanois (Jean Servais) who reluctantly decides to team with 2 of his friends and a safecracker, called Cesar (Jules Dassin), and do one last job after he’s just been released from a five-year prison sentence. But the heist isn’t easy, the hardness of the job is particularly emphasised when Tony shows how sensitive the alarm system in jewellery shop, they plan to rob, is. Overall most of the film kept me interested right up until the last minute. But scenes in the film were a bit slow and seemed unrelated to the rest of the movie. And I think these scenes made the film too long and they should have been shortened down or deleted altogether. I also think the film title is poorly chosen.
On the other hand most of the film was filled with action and suspense, my favourite scene in the film is the heist which had me sitting on the edge of my seat and hoping that the alarm wouldn’t go off. Shortly after this scene the film also kept me interested by showing that the robbers weren’t safe even after the heist seemed to be successful. The film also got me interested at the beginning by showing Tony as a frail character who had just been released from a five-year prison sentence. This got me interested because it made me think that he may be too old and too weak to rob a jewellery shop with a very complicated alarm system.
I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in Heist film that are filled with suspense and action and I would rate it 6 out of 10."

Therefore, none of the characters are categorizable into the typical archetypes of good or bad. This ""realness"" of the characters' personalities, however, makes the movie's storytelling very unusual to the habits and expectations of us western moviegoers. Moreover, one might miss a sense of having learned a lesson over the course of the film, for the parents do not rethink their piggishness, and Chihiro, despite many experiences and therefore many opportunities, does not appear to have grown much out from her childish vulnerability and dependence either. For these reasons, and despite its vivid imagination, Spirited Away (has great potential, but) might not satisfy everyone.

Visual and audio aspects are well-thought supporting the narrative. Dialogue and acting are plausible, no complaiments there. The huge problem is the script itself. This is a movie in which every white man and woman is either a coward, villain or most often a complete psychopat. Except Brad Pitt. The producer rides in as a modern Jesus to save the day in the last minutes of the movie **** any illusion of realism. Storyline lacks twists and situations to make the flick interesting. Basicly the main characters get flogged for few hours and thats it. New York is a paradise where every1 is happy and educated regardless of their race or backround. Just like today! Ofc this is ""based on true story"", but as far as i know any story is fictional interpretation of actual events. Thats why they are called stories. Historically the laws allowed atrocities of many kind but I really doubt that the people who owned the slaves could really beat them to death continuously. I mean, the slaves cost thousands of dollars to buy. Feeding and shelter costs. Why beat the workforce to death? Just makes no sense. Also, there was no indication that after the slavery-laws were eradicated the position of blacks actually got even worse, since they became regular workforce who had to provide accommadation and food by themselves.

It is more of a string of vignettes about several heartless and evil white men (and women) who are just mean without the motivation of running a plantation on their minds.

There are just a few moments when one embraces the supposed depth of it, but they aren't able to support the whole length. The acting is just sufficient, and the character of Solomon himself lacks the development the film promises. The soundtrack is awful and seems to be made of only two tracks. Cinematography I would say is the best bit.

This film adds nothing to the account of slavery films, and this is somewhat shocking given it is a true story after all. One thing more: ""Django Unchained"" was heavily criticised for the constant use of the word **** with people ranting on and on about how it was inappropriate. That doesn't seem to apply to 12 Years a Slave for reason unknown. And, since I mentioned it, Django Unchained was a more likeable and even a more historically accurate film, without pretentiousness and without trying too much (or at all) to involve the viewer to a point when we feel a bit nauseated by this eagerness."

Many of the scenes played like historical reenactments for the History Channel. Some of the performances were so terrible it was like they shot the rehearsal.

113,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/12-years-a-slave/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Nov 1, 2013",4,"In ""12 Years A Slave"" there is a scene between Platt/Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Patsy (Lupita Nyong'o that is startling, stark and will have your emotions all over the place. It is one of the very few scenes that delivers all the hype that the movie has promised.  All in all I found the movie very disappointing and realize that I am a minority having this opinion.

There were  many scenes that director Steve McQueen holds 3-4 beats, if not 1-2 minutes, such as the 'song' by Tibeats (Paul Dano), too long and some photograph like  frames, mostly of nature scenes, that combine to make the movie seem excessive diluting those times it should have moved quicker. Moving back and forth in time, instead of telling the story in a straight line, doesn't add anything and with repeating scenes, once again, elongates the story that would have been stronger if shorter.

The acting is certainly first rate though Michael Fassbender should be getting a lot more attention for his role as  plantation/slave owner Edwin Epps, frightening in his drunken evilness. As Platt/Solomon, the freeman, who is kidnapped and sent to the south as a slave, Ejiofer carries the burden of the film as a victim who refuses to be one though at times he seems to be too passive as an actor, not a slave, for how he overcomes all that is thrown at him.

The rest of the cast, mostly cameos by Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti,  Sarah Paulson and Alfre Woodard are effective though when Brad Pitt appears it takes you out of the movie because it is Brad Pitt.

There is nudity, none gratuitous, violence and cruelty, though except for the scene mentioned in the first paragraph and an attempted lynching scene of Northup, very little of it hit me emotionally

Based on a true story about, and book written by, Northup and the publicity he received it is questionable that how and/or where he died is unknown.

Comes award time the movie and actors will be up for many awards but the bottom line for me is that I won't recommend it."

118,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/ratatouille/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,drqshadow,"Aug 28, 2024",6,"Pixar stuffs a foodie rat under the toque of a wannabe chef with one foot (barely) in the door at a fading gourmet restaurant. The rodent was weaned on cooking TV shows, the human represents the end of a celebrity chef’s bloodline, and together they manage just enough culinary magic to raise a ruckus in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower.

Ratatouille’s scenery is enchanting and its food is mouth-watering, but its core ingredients are rather thin. Neither Remy (the rat) nor Alfredo (the man-child) enjoy an especially deep or involved character arc, two cases of WYSIWYG given flesh, and Pixar seems to recognize this, crowding the scenery with all manner of half-hearted side dishes to compensate. I was hardly surprised to learn of a shakeup behind the scenes, with original director and screenwriter Jan Pinkava ousted in favor of then-ascendant studio bigwig Brad Bird. Despite the late shift, this still feels like an unfocused draft. The technical team does its job well - Alfredo’s physical comedy is riotous, Remy’s all-too-limited tasting scenes are bright and imaginative, the city and kitchen both look gorgeous - but it all feels a little wasted without a more substantial base.

I recognize and appreciate the irony of critiquing a movie in which a snobby food critic is the big bad. Wish I could say that my second viewing, and first in around a decade, could’ve provided me with the same kind of big revelation that my on-screen counterpart enjoys. Instead, I must confess that Ratatouille still lives in precisely the same place I left it. Enjoyable but very light, and a far cry from the kind of potent, accomplished material we expected of Pixar at the time.

My preceding review from 2014: One of the few Pixar movies I hadn't yet seen. Like each of their other films, this is witty, beautiful and genuine, but in the end feels like light fare compared to some of the studio's masterworks. It doesn't have the suspense of The Incredibles, the heart of Up or the scale of Wall-E, for example, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy it.

The script enjoys a few big, family-friendly laughs, the animation shows some real inspiration (I appreciated the visualizations of competing/combining flavors) and it gets points for the unique setting, but it never really finds that essential moment where everything shifts into overdrive.

Ah, well. My least favorite Pixar effort is still better than most of the competition."

I expected something more. The script is simple: in the near future, a severe blast causes a chain reaction destroying most orbiting satellites and launching a shower of space debris compromising the survival of a team of American astronauts who were repairing the Hubble Telescope. It's a plot that works but has serious credibility problems based on the great improbability of all our satellites being destroyed at the same time. It also totally ignores some science issues such as the abundance of space junk in Earth's orbit and has a plot hole that rubs the absurd: how the astronauts were able to listen to dogs in China if they were not even able to communicate with the own base in Houston? Sandra Bullock is the main character, in the role of a scientist who was selected for that mission by being an expert on the subject. The actress is good and her quality is unquestionable but I think her character wasn't well thought. Despite being a rookie in space and showing little training, her character is able to decently decouple herself in a ISS shuttle and in a Chinese one, something her training would probably never have prepared her for not being strictly necessary to her mission. There is a latent contradiction here, and it does not to be a physical or a genius to realize that and to detect others in the film. George Clooney is a good supporting actor but sometimes his posture, somewhat childish and relaxed, prevented me from actually feeling any tension, not to mention that the way he dies is absolutely cliché. The direction of Alfonso Cuaron works reasonably, and I think I realized some scenes that intentionally copy great films of the past in order to to honor them. This is beautiful and symbolic. The end of the film also seems loaded with symbolism.

The technical issue, however, is beyond reproach. CGI is absolutely grand and the images of our planet are breathtaking. I liked cinematography and soundtrack, discrete but competent. The way they put the actors floating weightless also seems incredible and realistic, just like the ships, tools, space suits and even the floating debris. Visually, the film is powerful and realistic but it's not the first time I say this: it's not a CGI storm that makes a good movie. The script has to be good. And the fact is that the script of this film, although it works, has a lot of holes, errors, absurd moments and contradictions. No matter how improbable is the situation the movie shows, the audience has to feel that it's real and it's happening. And I could not feel it here."

My imaginary version of Gravity is a better meditation on death but it’s also way the **** boring as compared to the real Gravity. Alfonso Cuarón perfected some of the best longshots in film history with Children of Men and he brings the same choreographic talent to 0 G—shut up Neil Tyson, stop texting during the goddamn movie—sorry. Anyway, it’s beautiful and real enough to be a non-stop human vs. space thrill. An internal subplot about Sandra Bullock’s daughter and some heavy-handed symbolism kind of stilt the action through the second and third trimester (wink) though. It’s frustrating because in a very spare film these sorts of additions stand in high relief, which is great if you’re trying to say something, but just confusing if you have nothing to say. I don’t think Gravity actually has anything to say about death, birth, or evolution, but I liked it enough as a space thriller that if someone can convince me that there is something to its reference of those three concepts in a way that does not make you sound like a stoned college freshman then I will call it an 8."

The tension of the film never feels real to me, because the film constantly bends it's own rules to keep a character alive. Then 37 minutes into an approximately 90 minute movie, the film takes an unexpected turn that renders the rest of the film moot, and completely destroys any potential tension any viewer who is paying attention would have felt.

This was more like dot points to what will happen if certain events took place in space whilst you were space walking. If it were based on a true story i wouldn't have expected anything more than what it was, in fact i would have scored a lot higher. But it wasn't, it was made up. And that is my problem, there could have been a little more story telling more feeling maybe some romance etc. I loved the visual aspect and thought the acting was great. In fact i thought it was made really well, just needed more story telling, it felt bland."

My first viewing, I had a much higher opinion of this film, swept up in the hype surrounding it and blinded by its technical accomplishment. My second viewing, issues with the story (or lack of) were magnified and severely detracted from the film."

Este largometraje empieza bien, y continúa así hasta los primeros 15 minutos, luego de eso ya la película empieza a buscar soluciones para encajar bien las piezas del final, pero, esas soluciones hacen que la película se torne aburrida, simplona y fastidiosa hasta que llegan los últimos 15 minutos.

No alien in this one, this time we’re getting a somewhat Realistic look at things going wrong for space fearing Astronauts.  I was a bit surprised to see Hollywood getting out to space, in this manner.  Hollywood sort of gave up on the Science Fiction, long time ago, as Special Effects got way too costly.  Have you seen anything new in SFX lately, chances are no.  Hollywood’s love affair with Space is a cost conscious one.
Wouldn’t want to take a slash out of those Worldwide Box Office Figs, now would we!

This movie is alright, but the banter is not very professional, this feels like some famous people popping up all of a sudden and wondering if they can handle a movie in space.  Two Fabs are on hand, Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, the look of the film is good, and the ending fine, but I was surprised that Gravity had suddenly ended, then I looked and saw that it was only one half hour.

Concise, was the play this time.

The Science Fiction is in the Books, that’s the Only place to find it.

The likelyhood of the events happening in the movie is completely impossible.   The odds of the space station that broke apart being just a few miles away from the I.S.S is completely improbable.  Sandra Bullock also used up almost all of her oxygen in a minuted and was left with just 3% of it left and you expect me to believe that she survived for another hour in space before she got to the International Space Station on just that.  I think not.  The script writers should have payed more attention to the facts before writing these impossible ways Sandra could have survived.

I still find myself trying to figure out how this movie has won critical acclaim when there are so many holes in the plot line, that it is distracting to think logically while watching the film. This is especially true for science buffs. To sum it up, the movie offers cool visuals while functioning on the level of self-importance. If you truly want to see a great space movie, turn to Kubric's Space Odyssey; it is breathtaking."

Yes the space action scenes are cool and realistic, but the pacing and the plot leaves much to be desired.  It's like a few minutes of ""cool"" sandwiched in 2 hours of ""boring"".   And don't get me started on the ridiculous idea that the Russians, who have been a spacefaring nation for over half a century will make the stupid mistake of shooting down their own satellite when while it was in the same altitude as several other satellites and the International Space Station is ridiculous.  The Russians usually just maneuver satellites they want to ""retire"" into the upper atmosphere and let it burn or crash to Earth.

This movie didn't make me care whether the main character lived or died in orbit.  It was that lame."

161,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/gravity/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,fi57yseven,"Mar 7, 2014",4,"Let's simply make a few points, Pros and Cons

Pros:
1. Great Visuals
2. Steady paced does not get boring

Cons:
1. SANDRA BULLOCK..same character in every movie she is in, panics in every scene and is practically hopeless
2. Story..very weak and felt they had to fill it with pointless stories to fill awkward silences.
3. Predictable
4. All the stations get destroyed pretty much on the second Sandra Bullock arrives, even though the debris had already circled twice.
5. Terrible ending

This film is terrible. only good things are the visuals and the pace the movie goes at. if they casted a better female actress who didn't just panic and flap her hands about like in EVERY  film she has ever done, this maybe would have been a worthy Oscar winner."

I would also say  Sandra Bullocks acting is very well done despite not getting the best written character. The script in my opinion is the biggest weak point to this movie for me. The first time the debris hits them I was blown away, and I was really excited and anxious about if they would make it. But then it just seems t repeat itself over and over again and I started to care a little less after each bad thing that happens to her. This is one of the unluckiest people ever. Worth a watch for the amazing visuals but that pretty much the only reason to watch it, just like Avatar."
166,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/gravity/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,imafallguy,"Feb 21, 2014",5,"Gravity (2013): Utterly Weightless

Let's just get this out of the way up front- if you're to garner even one iota of enjoyment out of Gravity it must be viewed on the largest screen possible donning a pair of 3D glasses. Surround sound is also imperative but if you've managed a Big Screen 3D setup, odds are you've got the audio side of the equation covered. Experiencing Gravity in any other way is simply not an option. I was fortunate enough to see Gravity on a 55"" active 3D display in Dolby 5.1 (my home theater setup) and that would be considered the bare minimum requirement. It's certainly no Imax. Imagine watching the latest Pixar flick on a portable black and white monitor with the sound muted. Sound like fun? No? Then don't bother watching this in the comfort of your living room unless your home theater meets AT LEAST the previously stated requirements. This really can't be stressed enough. Onto the review...

2001, Alien, Moon. These films are considered classics of American cinema for very good reason, they all have superb story arcs bolstered by deep, rich character development. Alfonso Cuarón’s latest theatrical release, Gravity, has neither. Much like the empty environment the film takes place in, Gravity offers up breathtaking visuals but is utterly devoid of anything else.

Instead of a proper film, we're ""treated"" to an artistic experiment in the use of state of the art visual and audio effects to induce an intimate form of awe and panic. Something a standard 2D stereo film can't possibly replicate. And, as such, it's a smashing success. In one especially intense scene early on during Act I, Cuarón utilizes his trademarked long form single camera shot sequence (13 minutes to be exact) to make us feel the empty helplessness that Dr. Ryan (played adequately by Sandra Bullock) is surely experiencing. It works to great effect, and don't be surprised if a bit of sweat drips from your brow in the process.

So far, so good and we feel invested in our own survival. Not Dr. Ryan's survival mind you, she doesn't exist so much as a character but more of a human prop to advance the films running time. No, the clever use of 3D photography has us invested far more in our own well being then either that of Dr. Ryan or Matt Kowalsky (again, adequately played by George Clooney). I, for one, have felt neither dread nor danger in the cinema or my own couch outside of this expertly crafted opening sequence.

And then...nothing. This pony has flawlessly performed it's single trick. And it is quite the trick, but not something that can sustain any amount of interest past the 30 minute mark. I take pride in writing spoiler free reviews, so suffice it to say Gravity takes place in space (that much should already be abundantly clear), while ""space stuff"" sporadically explodes silently, life support mechanisms fail, and our two protagonists fight to make their way back to Cape Canaveral, or any place on Earth really, in one piece.

While a superficial attempt at character development is made by the filmmakers to inject Dr. Ryan and Kowalsky with heart and soul, it doesn't work. The failure to make us care about the films only two human assets is Gravity's greatest weakness. Will Ryan and Kowalsky triumph over the terrors of being stranded in space when their only ride back home has been devastated, or will they float endlessly into the dark abyss until they die slowly of asphyxiation? We have no emotional investment tied to either character, so who cares if they live or die? Maybe Kowalsky is a pedophile who deserves it. I don't know anything about him other than he was at Mardi Gras in 1987 and likes to talk about it.

Ultimately, Gravity is a visual spectacle that elevates the use of 3D in moviemaking to new heights, much like James Cameron did with Avatar. The difference being Cameron told a story, one that we actually cared about. The same can't be said for Gravity.

As much as the movie going audience and critics alike bemoan the use of 3D in modern filmmaking, Gravity shows us that, when done properly, the addition of a third dimension draws us in much closer to the story being told. But if that story isn't engaging and the characters aren't captivating, no amount of floating wrenches and exploding spaceships will transform a lackluster movie into a good one.

I love 3D and hope Gravity's success spurs a second renaissance for the fading technology. If nothing else, this film proves without question that 3D can draw viewers into a movie in a way that standard two dimensions never could. What 3D will never be able to do, however, is create an interesting story where one simply doesn't exist, as is the case with Gravity.

If you have the means to experience this film the way it was intended, you should absolutely do so. It very well may change your opinion on the importance of 3D in movie making. Just don't go in expecting a good movie, because Gravity isn't one."

If you enjoy watching Sandra Bullock screaming, panicking and spinning around in space for an hour, you will have a great time. Double the great time if you also enjoy watching her play a lifeless, boring character who you (not so) secretly hope will get hit by satellite debris.

Otherwise, just sit back and enjoy the beautiful views of earth and space, and try not to be annoyed by the constant, overly-dramatic transitions from the serene silence of space to loud noises, explosions and heavy breathing."

My problem was that I I had a hard time turning off the technician side of my brain. I treated this film as a scenario rather than sci-fi, and frankly, I didn't buy it. (And from the comments I heard recently by the astronauts aboard the ISS who saw the film, neither did they.) Too many laws of physics broken for my taste.

Bullock did a fairly good job as Ryan Stone, but Clooney's alpha-male bluster made me want to wretch.

Great effects don't make a great movie. They are supposed to enhance a strong story and 'Gravity' is certainly lacking in that department.

Having said all of that, I was entertained for 90 minutes, so I can't trash this film **** a Best Picture **** gotta be kidding me.

Not only is it just ludicrous to put religious themes in there but the fact that the laws of physics didn't even apply was the worst part, apparently the ISS was only 100 miles from the shuttle but if you look at the Earth and the ISS it is clear it is almost 3,000km away! Such a stupid film and mind numbingly offensive to people with knowledge on Astronomy. Sandra Bullick also acted horribly and unrealistically, no depth to her character at all, just strange reactions and boring backstory on her daughter. One thing I'll give it is the cinematography is superb but if you have a background on Astronomy DON'T WATCH THIS FILM! It will frustrate the **** out of you. ﻿"

Visually the appeal takes time to develop. It's a dark, deary and uninteresting first several minutes, and I wouldn't understand how that would attract children to become immersed. However past that the film starts to develop a flame, but just as it does we get a super long look as Gaston, and that's all we really learn about him. The pace keeps getting killed. He's a very one sided somewhat misunderstood neutral character that is merely guilty of not having the intelligence to understand what is really happening, and the comedic elements concerning his sidekicks fail terribly. The film tries to force ideas and concepts, but the execution often pulls away from what they are attempting to convey.

However the atmosphere, songs and voice acting are some of the best Disney have to offer. I just think with the entire running time, they could have easily put more umph and actual plot devices into this, especially concerning Gaston.

It's not my type of film, but I can see objectively it doesn't really have anything offensively bad. It's just not a very inventive take on this romance story."

Of course, like anyone who was young in the past decade, I also succumbed to Facebook's hypnosis and I still have an account on this social network, but I confess that I haven't been there in months and I haven't spent much time there. This spell that Facebook, and all other social networks, could have on me has long since lost its effect. Today, and I will be very honest in what I am going to say, I see no reason to spend hours stuck to a social network, putting likes on posts, commenting or talking to other people. Now, let's talk about the film itself.

The film is not bad, but it is far from being something I want to see again. The plot addresses the process of creating and developing Facebook and the legal struggles that Mark Zuckerberg faced after that. Directed by David Fincher, it is quite weak in its task because, as it happens a lot with films based on real facts, it creates a new fictional story over real people. I know this is cinema, creative freedom is part of cinematographic art but, as I said in a lot of other reviews, there are logical limits to that freedom when dealing with real people and, worse, people who is still quite... alive.

The cast has a lot of easily recognizable names and most have made a very positive effort. However, not everything went well. The way the characters were thought was what most irritated me. If some are stupid teenagers, others are opportunists, and there are still a lot of smart **** There is virtually no character we can like and that blocked my interest in what I was seeing. Thus, we have Jesse Eisenberg in the shoes of Zuckerberg, but in such a negative way and with so bad material that the character is inedible. He is a complete jerk, unable to capture the audience's sympathy. Dakota Johnson, Max Minghella, Rooney Mara and Joseph Mazzello try to help, however they have little to do, once the film is delivered to Eisenberg. On the positive side, we have the good performances of Andrew Garfield, who gave life to Facebook's first CFO, as well as Justin Timberlake, who was very good in his role too. Armie Hammer surprises by giving life to twin brothers in an impressive and realistic way.

Winner of three Oscars (Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Original Song), it is technically a capable and decent film but not impressive. It has regular cinematography, sets and costumes and, despite the prizes, the soundtrack did not impress or attract my attention.

Honestly, I don't even understand the visibility given to this film. I don't think it justifies it, and maybe it was very stimulated by advertising and the media (convenient for the social network portrayed, isn't it?)."

183,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-social-network/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,MrMovieBuff,"Oct 31, 2015",6,"Perhaps I would have liked this movie, if David Fincher allowed me to get immersed into the main character's journey through being something more. The first two acts of this movie are drawn out and excruciatingly slow paced.

Jesse Eisenberg plays Facebook creator Mark Zuckerbeg, who attends Harvard University and decides to create an innovative social networking site where people can easily stay in touch. Andrew Garfield plays his closest friend Edwardo who is promised to be in on the business, but their friendship is tested to the extreme as the success of Facebook grows.

I cannot help but feel the only reason this movie is so highly praised is because Facebook is the main subject matter. Anything Facebook related, many teenagers or young adults will flock to see and will find some form of interest in the subject.

The first two acts of the movie, like I said, was frustratingly slow paced, there is nothing of remote interest going on here. Eisenberg and co do fine in their performances (Eisenberg landed an Oscar nomination), but I just found too many of the film's main characters to be cold and unlikeable, unless that's how all Facebook users are...which at times is true.

I cannot think of any real reason as to why this is such a masterpiece of a film, David Fincher is an exceptional filmmaker and Aaron Sorkin is a talented screenwriter, but the film didn't need to drag for as long as it did for the main story to kick in.

There are some good things in this film, but not enough for me to say that it was worth it or a must-see."

I have no idea what any of equations or algorithms mean, or how to write script.
Maybe I’m a little jealous because I never got to go to college parties as glamorous as the ones in this film?
Or maybe the problem is that the subject matter it just so banal that despite the quality of the production, this film is lost on me?
I have a problem with this film that is so full of maybes. And yet for all its weaknesses, it won three Oscars, albeit one of them was for Baxter and Wall's editing, which is superb. Both editors have worked on numerous Fincher productions.

None of the actors are convincing at portraying the real people they are supposed represent. Maybe that’s the point? They are attempting to play versions of Zuckerberg and Co. that seem more interesting than the real, live versions.
I guess I see the reasoning behind this. As activities, creating companies, programming computers, or writing software, no matter how profound, aren’t exactly as riveting as invading Bin Laden’s compound, or smuggling blood diamonds out of Liberia.
Still, I am no fan of Jesse Eisenberg. His success is baffling to me. He was for a while a Michael Cera impersonation gone wrong, now, whatever he is, he does it well. He sells tons of tickets…but none of them are to me.
The best part about this film is that it has Rooney Mara, briefly. Later she becomes Lisbeth in Dragon Tattoo.

The most interesting thing about this film is simply that it exists and was so successful. Rather, that a production company actually paid David Fincher to try and create a full-on thriller packed with betraying, greedy, snarky little boys either getting their way, or losing millions of dollars. Poor babies.
Even if in the end Zuckerberg did create something monumental, so what. It's just a monument to a monument. What does any of this represent? How does any of this change the world?
It’s not like Facebook has cured any sick people or stopped any wars. It’s arguably even created a recent few (of both)."

The acting isn't great but the movie is admittedly entertaining to watch. Sure, there are no fillers and it starts immediately with no intro, but there seemed to be something missing.

The story is told through flashbacks from courtroom tribunals between Zuckerberg and the people he has managed to wrong. This is confusing as it switches from one law suit to another without giving any idea of which came first. Add to this one is abruptly dropped from the film and focus is centered on the other I began to wonder why not focus on one in the first place. One of my biggest problems with the film was Jessie Eisenberg and writer Aaron Sorkins Portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg. As one character puts it ""you're not an  but your trying very hard to be one."" This is the perfect description of the character, who is completely unlikeable with his rambling monologues and irritating behavior. The rest of the cast too is unbearable and i would struggle to find I a character Iiked. The direction too leaves a lot to be desired as director David Fincher struggles at making one scene different from another as all anyone seems to be doing is sitting at a computer. The film seems to require a degree in computer programing as the character spew technical lingo constantly, helping add to the difficulty following the plot. Add to this a terrible ending and you would think this was the worst film ever, however for some reason the film was one I couldn't stop watching for some reason.

Fincher's flashback storytelling didn't make me feel like I was getting different perspectives and narrative layers. Rather, I felt like I was watching an intervention where everyone else could freely speak except the very person at the centre of the screen. Instead of a balanced, well-rounded portrayal of the facts, the filmmakers dramatised the whiny testimonies of scorned 'victims' to depict a character so contorted and contrived he didn't look like a real human being. Someone as aware of his brilliance as the on-screen Mark Zuckerberg wouldn't feel insecure enough to crave acceptance into a final club. His natural genius would set him apart enough and he wouldn't waste time garnering adulation from less intelligent people to affirm that. The movie depicts the cinematic Mark Zuckerberg being so engrossed in creating revolutionary projects that he pays very little attention to social conventions and appearance. Yet the same acutely logical person wastes a chunk of the movie being envious that his friend Eduardo is more 'popular'. To create a Shakespearean-like tragedy, Aaron Sorkin afflicted the protagonist with various 'fatal flaws' to amplify conflict. Facts were twisted to fit into the salacious story the filmmakers wanted to tell. Real people were twisted to fit into the salacious characters the filmmakers wanted to show. The movie was nowhere as clever as it thought it was and by the end of the first scene you knew exactly what it was trying to say ('social misfit invents new way to socialise'). It's as if the filmmakers started the film with that message and then worked backwards, fitting real life people and events around that theme rather than use the truth.  At its worst, TSN was slanderous non-fiction masquerading as entertainment. At its best, it was entertaining fiction masquerading as fact....Either way for me it didn't live up to its hype."

But instead the film tells the rather less interesting but more sensational story of elitist, entitled children squabbling over power and money.

That this unredeeming tale of supersized greed is compelling is a testament to Sorkin's barrage of clever dialogue, so fast-paced that one scarcely has time to reflect on the fact that one is watching a paean to latter-day robber barons.

The film's self-conscious the-geek-shall-inherit-the-earth message is as close as it ever gets to a penetrating social observation, but there's plenty of soap opera serving as a stand-in. Gorgeous groupies and rock-star recklessness are thrown in to distract the viewer, and unfortunately the filmmakers as well, from the fact that there is no there there. The cultural landscape has been forever changed by the economic meltdown of 2008. The very idea that one could make a movie about the most successful entrepreneurs of our time, and not even acknowledge this change is curious, and raises the suspicion that both Sorkin and Fincher are personally invested in the ""classless society"" myth. That disconnect is the fatal crack in the shiny veneer of this work, and suggests to me for the first time, that Sorkin may have passed his sell-by date."

I'm happy to enjoy movies based on the work of a Broadway playwright, even if the effect is one of staginess.  But having your central character remain a cipher is always a dangerous strategy.  Jesse Eisenberg does a great job of trying to fill in the blanks of Mark Zuckerberg, as written, and he deserves high praise.  Of course, Sorkin and Fincher may have been constrained by legal injuctions, so MZ had to be a cardboard character.  A workaround was to create the two best female parts in the story as bookends: the girlfriend in the first scene (who sees into his soul) and the second chair attorney at the deposition (who sees even deeper) in the final scene.  Smart choices, here, Mr. Sorkin.  But the movie ended and I felt the Zuckerberg character had never arrived."

""Amour"" is a case in point and suggests that the line between demographic-massaging advertising agencies and shrewd, cachet-hunting filmmakers is diminishing at an alarming rate. The film is basically a genteel “infomercial” that argues the case for  euthanasia; it's an highly aggressive, in-your-face exercise and a very ONE-NOTE, highly aggressive, in-your-face exercise..........What it also has “going for it”  in some circles at any rate- is the Jerry Springer-like touch of casting two well known stars of yesteryear, now in their 80s, in the lead roles. This brings an eerie Reality TV touch to the proceedings and something of a “frisson nouveau” to your card-carrying film buff audience (the demographic-massaging angle) Think how much, by way of  comparison, the casting two relative unknowns would have affected the film’s reception...... In Teen Speak it would have been …..“B-O-R-R-R-I-N-G !!!”

Jean-Louis Trintignant in particular struggles to breath life into the sparse characterization that writer/director Haneke has provided for  him. However his efforts are in vain, for the forces of “infomercial-hood” are aligned against him here and (even more artistically crippling) Haneke’s somewhat gleeful penchant for the morbid. This latter  holds sway as his camera zooms in to capture every detail of the physical and mental disintegration of Trintignant‘s wife (the now 85-year-old star of ""Hiroshima Mon Amour""  Emmanuelle Riva.) Indeed, Riva’s character soon becomes a sort of laboratory specimen that Haneke is studying intently under the microscope  “I wonder what will “go” next  he seems to be asking himself, pencil in hand   with the result that The Wife (which is the sort of generic entity that Riva is finally reduced to) ends up becoming disconcertingly like that giant bug that Gregor Samsa turns into in Kafka’s ""The Metamorphosis""   By contrast, one wonders what Jean Renoir or Douglas Sirk would have done with  this material. The fact that Riva’s character is not particularly sympathetic to begin with only adds to the uneasiness- indeed, queasiness- we end up experiencing as we’re invited to observe the spectacle of her relentless undoing....... Sad to say, by that point in the film either this latter studying-the-bug-under-the-microscope sensation or else flat out boredom seem to be our only options. ""Amour"" is an award-winning and highly pretentious film and the two go together much too often for comfort these days."

CONS: The characters are simply not interesting or compelling people. We were led to believe that something ""deep"" was going on because of so much silence and empty space in the film. The male lead appropriately and scornfully dismissed a careless nurse, but did not treat his wife that well himself. While it's true that sometimes silence can be profound, it's also true that silence can be empty. Some films use sadness and space to communicate important and useful messages.

So I watched the film with my dad, brother and sister, and while there were some good things, such as the direction and how it was made, I was left disappointed as well. I really wanted to like this film, but the thing was it didn't completely grip or excite me.

VISUALS: Definitely what made the movie. The locations and scenery gave a real sense of authenticity, and in general the camera work was good. Though in some scenes, there was a little much of the hand held camera stuff, unless it was intentional, some of the camera movements were rather shaky. The special effects were very good though, and there are some terrific looking set pieces.

SOUND: The sound is wonderful. If you have the film on the highest volume, the sound the bombs and guns make is close to deafening. The sound as well as the visuals added to the authenticity.

DIRECTION: Kathryn Bigelow's direction here is astounding. It is secure and focused and avoids red wire/yellow wire cliché and manages not to preach too much.

ACTING: I will be explaining later how disappointed I was in the character development, but I thought the acting was reasonably good with what they had. Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are believable and display good chemistry together. David Morse and Ralph Fiennes do what they can, which admittedly isn't much, in smaller roles. Evangeline Lilly looks lovely, but she doesn't do or say much other than be another person that one of the characters knows.

MUSIC: I am probably alone in this thought, but the music for me was a disappointment. There are parts where it is generic, and others where scenes are very dramatic where it felt somewhat intrusive.

SCRIPT: The actors don't really have that much to work with. Sure it focuses on the contrasting attitudes and philosophies of the three soldiers, who are aware that any job they do can be their last. The script doesn't do that to convey this though, some of it is clichéd and it felt like every 20 words when one character uttered an obscenity and then another. Plus it doesn't really say that much.

STORY: The story structure felt rather episodic in this film. Immediately after the characters do something they are immediately doing another thing without hesitation. After seeing half an hour or so of shooting guns I did start losing interest, maybe it was to do with the uneven pacing, and not even the final 10 minutes managed to excite me.

CHARACTERS: The characterisation is disappointingly thin here, and to almost all the characters I was indifferent to. Other than the fact they are soldiers and one of them has a wife and baby back home, you don't learn that much about the characters. Throughout they feel rather thinly sketched, perhaps it would've helped if the film had a couple of back stories like they do in Lost. That way I would have felt differently.

The movie is so slow, at some moments you just feel bored and waiting for the end, three long, tense bomb-defusing scenes that don't vary much.

In addition, there is no backstory of any character so you can connect with it, just you can see fearless bomb-disposal specialist (Jeremy Renner) with his team (Anthony Mackie & Brian Geraghty) how they spend their day in the wartime. I can't ignore the solid performance by Jeremy Renner.

No matter what my opinion about the Iraq war, the story was little different from other war movies, but they didn't use this privilege to make something impressive, There were some suspense moments in the film, but mostly was boring."

While it may be more accurate than many other war movies, this one was built on realism. However an informed viewer will note that the movie does not portray well the soldiers' lives and the Iraq war. Many bomb squad members said so themselves, including the ones that were interviewed by the movie makers. All the portrayed military operations are inaccurate. This movie is a lie. However can it still be viewed as a regular war action movie? I'm afraid not. Without the sense of reality the movie loses all interest. To conclude, not only does this movie fail at what it sells for, which is a close enough portrayal of wartime, it also fails as an action movie. The only praise I can give is the amazing work achieved by the actors. You will enjoy this movie though if you do not know much about the Iraq war, like most Americans unfortunately."

231,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-hurt-locker/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,G_Thomas_Boston,"Apr 25, 2013",4,"This is a movie about bombs. Lots of bombs. Desert bombs.

The End.

That's pretty much it. Oh sure, a few other things happened. You wanna hear about 'em? OK. I'll provide you with a little more, oh faithful reader.

I'm still not sure what the title The Hurt Locker refers to. It's not about well-secured first aid kits, nor is it about gymnasium facilities for actors William, John, or even Mary Beth.

This celluloid endeavor was directed by Kathryn Bigelow; the deft hand behind such legendary screen classics as Point Break and Blue Steel. It stars Jeremy Renner as Staff Sergeant William James, an expert at diffusing bombs. Joining him on the Explosivity Disposaling Unit are Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Owen Eldrige (Brian Geraghty)

Renner has been nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. I'm not sure why this is. The supporting performances  most notably Mackie's  were, in my opinion, superior. All Renner did was act ""cool"". Oh, so ""cool"". Desert ""cool"". But if looking ""cool"" is the only criterion used for award recognition, then David Caruso should be nominated for a Nobel Prize.

The film centers mostly on the antics of Sergeant James. James loves dismantling things that can blow you into a zillion pieces. He'd rather do that than live a peaceful life in a nice home with his beautiful wife. We're shown some of his domestic life, but the movie doesn't show the good stuff. No. Instead we see him cleaning out the eavestrough of his house.

Now I've cleaned out a few roof gutters in my time, but the one depicted here has to be the gunkiest gutter in the history of home maintenance. And he's cleaning it out with his bare hand!!! C'mon, use a scoop, or a trowel, or a toy shovel, a stick, a shoe, anything. I'd rather diffuse bombs in Iraq than have to clean out that gutter in that fashion.

Another scene worth mentioning shows the guys  after getting a little snockered  engaging in an activity where good judgment and mental acuity would be a distinct disadvantage. The ""game"" involves taking turns hitting each other as hard as possible in the stomach. My wife, while watching this powerful and touching scene, turned to me and asked, ""Why do men do those kind of things?""

You know, we men just have to chuckle when women ask us such questions. It was obvious to me, but I patiently explained it to her that this was a gesture of endearment. Women hug. Men try to smash the bejabers out of each other. It's their way of saying, ""You're OK in my book."" And nothing says it better than a ruptured spleen.

A word of warning here to those prone to seasickness: the camerawork in this film is of that hand-held style that so many directors are wont to use these days. I suppose they feel it gives their movies that gritty, realistic, documentary look  which is ironic, since documentary filmmakers rarely use the technique anymore. Besides, if it's supposed to look realistic, then why don't I see the real world that way through my eyes? Although if I did, I'd be making an appointment  and pronto  with an ophthalmologist or a brain surgeon.

If you have a tough time watching this film due to that camera style, then avoid The Bourne Ultimatum at all costs. You would not survive. Its visuals are worse than any bone-jarring experience you could imagine

I once took a ride on a gigantically tall roller coaster. Its peak disappeared into the clouds. It was called the Red Ripper, or the Brown Streak, or the Green Puker  something like that. Anyway, all I know is that I was smiling after that ride. I wasn't smiling after The Bourne Ultimatum.

In closing, I should say that even though I had some reservations about renting the DVD of The Hurt Locker, I was able to take something positive from it  a lesson.

The lesson learned is, pay attention to your reservations."
232,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-hurt-locker/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Tupe_N,"Feb 8, 2013",6,"At its best, Hurt Locker totally captivates the feeling of being there alongside Jeremy Renner and defusing the bomb rigged to explode. But sadly if you look past it's peaks moments, you find confusing scenes and poor acting. As an European, Hurt Locker doesn't really give you that much content or make you attached to the characters. I had absolutely no feelings towards Sergeant James (Jeremy Renner) and his crew, and because of this the tension about the bomb exploding or not was weak. It doesn't help at all that the characters have almost no background, especially the lead character was left blank.  There are some great scenes like the sniping on the desert and defusing of the car bomb. but to balance it out there are some odd ones like the scene in which they have a drunken brawl in the barracks. Also the plot is a confusing mess of highlights, that doesn't seem to start or end. The shots are beautiful and sharp, and the scenes are very real-like. A lot of the credit for the movies success goes to the film editing and cinematography departments. Somehow i still feel the movie is widely overrated, and doesn't really bring anything new or make the existing better. I think this is a national matter and Americans do enjoy this film more than us Europeans do, the subject of Iraq war is somehow reluctant to us, and bonding with the EOD-squad in two hours is very hard."

Thiz movie was using a lot of those shaky-camera techniques. The picture painted by no specific tone. All we saw just what we saw through our naked eyes. I knew that maybe they just wanted to capture things as realistic as they could get. But is that effective? Personally for me, I do not like it at all. The conventional movie makers had been trying to brush their picture into some kind of atmosphere. There is the art. If we let everybody treats the movie like thiz. I think anyone could make thiz kind of movie as long as they had their expensive digital camera. The movie played by second-class Actors which the most proportion went to two characters (Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie). Their performances were adequate. The other Casts were: Brian Geraghthy, Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, etc. The story itself contains no main-plot. We are just watching case by case about what is happening. The only thing that I respect on thiz movie is how the action scenes go. Previous warfare movies relied on big battle scenes with Big Boom Bang, like we saw on SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) and BLACK HAWK (2001). But thiz movie was using The Horror Formula (That was what I called). The scenes had been trying to create the tension by waiting something to happen next. Some of scenes were successfully pace our adrenaline. The movie directed by Kathryn Bigelow, The Director of POINT BREAK (1991) and K-19: THE WIDOWMAKER (2002). Overall, it is not a great warfare movie ever made compare to legendary APOCALYPSE NOW (1979) or FULL METAL JACKET (1987). Although I am fully support a woman Director to direct thiz kind of genre.

Even as a huge fan of his I cannot hold back but criticize that this movie was huge disappointment for me . It would've been a great movie if it was directed by some other guy but the bar has been set up too high by Quentin and I personally feel he's not even close to it . Though the movie starts brilliantly and almost drags you in their world ( That adrenaline scene . Wow!!!!)
But the second half is where I feel I was watching something else and it kind of felt dragged , it's not to say that it's the actor's fault , no not at all!! . They have given there very best ( especially John Travolta) but I feel the second half is not upto the mark . One might criticize that character development in the movie is what's so great about this movie and I believe it's true , but to my taste I feel there is not enough of plot development unlike Tarantino's other movies .

The movie is perfect in every way, except the plot. Despite the movie's issue only covering one field, PF just lost four points out of 10 because of filler that lasted for an hour. That filler constitutes of a scenario and a hangout. The scenario being Butch's part and the hangout, where the chick has zero involvement with the plot (if it has any). My father once asked me what Pulp Fiction is about and even I can't answer. Simply told it was an action/thriller starring Travolta and Willis.

In short, the plot is not present, despite the unique ""chronologic"" system, which is a really good move. If this movie has a proper plot, I would've given it a 10."

My list of people I geniuenly think are good actors is very small. I don't have a long list of bad actors per se but it takes a lot for me to see a performance in either light. Pulp Fiction added two to the list: Samuel L. Jackson and Amanda Plummer. Both of these actors knocked it out of the park and made themselves noticed. I thought I would give the movie 7/10 for the acting alone but then when I compiled my thoughts, I realized just how negative it gets. First off, the swearing dialogue, I can deal with foul language, but it did not flow. It got choppy and it was like Tarantino had a quota to meet, so he just kept sticking them in there.  Uma Thurman's character was ridiculous as was that whole random scene in the restaurant. The ending is beautiful don't get me wrong but the nonlinear set up really did not make sense at certain points nor when I looked it up did I think the chronological ending needed to happen. The leather person thing also made no sense. This was just like the director had a bunch of ideas, put it in a blender and spit it out and yet it is supposedly a masterpiece? Again, the only thing saving this score was the two masterful performances. It's a shame Amanda Plummer doesn't really have anything else to her name."

There are no characters to deeply connect or identify with and though there are some big names actors, their lines could have been delivered by seemingly any other talented actor. The introduction of the film is quite brutal and perhaps rightfully so if that was to show a point of the lengths personnel at a US government agency were willing to go to obtain information. The film's climax is the actual operation or mission to capture or kill Osama Bin Laden. This film keeps you on the edge but especially as it builds to this climactic ending.

It relies entirely on the viewer's emotional response to the events of 9/11 and frankly I would rather have watched a one-hour documentary than a ""dramatization"" with a runtime on the long side of two and a half hours.

Things that irked me:  The CIA station chief in Kabul isn't identified as the station chief till the film is halfway over.  A bomb goes off in a hotel and I expected a bomb to go off because it was the only time I'd seen the main character, Maya, sitting down in a hotel restaurant.  Another bomb goes off at a US base and I predicted that too because another CIA person insisted that the guy entering the base not be checked at the gate (and Maya wasn't present to suffer the effects of a bomb blast).  The only time we see Maya leave the US Embassy by herself there's a car waiting right outside the ""back gate"" (or whatever) and it's full of guys waiting to blast her with automatic rifles.  And then yet another CIA guy who is never really identified walks into a room full of CIA people and chews them out for failing to find bin Laden up till that point in the movie.

I suppose that if I forced myself to choose one main problem with the film it would have to be the lack of interesting characters.  Maya is an analyst, apparently, and she's determined to see bin Laden hunted down and killed.  And that's what happens.  The end.

Also, there's a severe lack of story.  Our heroes interrogate all kinds of people and then the critical step comes to light when some CIA person, never actually named, goes through ""all the files"" very carefully and discovers some guy they thought dead might actually be alive and so they hunt him down and, surprise, he leads them to bin Laden, or at least the house where they think bin Laden might be occupying.

Yes, we see lots of computers, lots of satellite images, and lots of stuff about how phone calls can be traced across the globe.  Yes, we spend some time in the streets trying to track down some courier guy talking on his cell phone.  Yes, we eventually end up in the compound where yet another helicopter on a critical mission malfunctions and crashes.  But none of it makes for movie gold.

And ultimately there's no definite proof that bin Laden is hiding out where they think he is hiding out.  It's chains of logic.  It's ""well this guy wouldn't be doing that unless X, Y, and Z, and therefore it's got bin Laden's face all over it.""

If you're interested in the bin Laden saga check out some documentaries and leave this turkey alone."

CONS: portrays CIA officers as ""heroes"" trying to defeat the ""bad guys""; makes a disturbing and misleading link between using torture and obtaining needed and reliable information, falsely implying that torture can be justified as an effective form of intelligence gathering; the statement “based on first-hand accounts of actual events” is deceptive because it leads viewers to believe the story is accurate and that the information obtained during or after the use of torture played a critical role in locating UBL, when that's not the case*.

*In January of 2013, senators John McCain, Dianne Feinstein and Carl Levin sent a letter to Acting CIA Director Michael Morell explaining that after a review of more than six million pages of CIA records, they made the following determination:
""The CIA did not first learn about the existence of the Usama Bin Laden courier from CIA detainees subjected to coercive interrogation techniques. Nor did the CIA discover the courier's identity from detainees subjected to coercive techniques. No detainee reported on the courier’s full name or specific whereabouts, and no detainee identified the compound in which Usama Bin Laden was hidden. Instead, the CIA learned of the existence of the courier, his true name and location through means unrelated to the CIA detention and interrogation program."""

Zero Dark Thirty

Between all the factual accuracy and controversies and unfortunate events the film fails to bind all of these into one entertaining drama resulting into an exhausting experience of 156 minutes of just plain old news. Zero Dark Thirty is of course written explicitly and executed with conviction but there is not a single lose thread for the audience to hang on to it until the curtain drops. Jessica Chastain holds on to her part of the role tightly till the end and is convincing throughout being aware of the pressure she has on this project since she is the only glue that binds it all and if they'd have given that character more gravitas and depth along with some high pitched dramatic sequences, it would have just worked. Zero Dark Thirty is the slow pill that takes its time offering weird sensations and some pain along the long road and then results into being the same old pain killer."

I'm giving this a 5 out of 10 because I'm not really sure what to think about it. With The Hurt Locker (Great movie BTW) there was a clear message that was put out there. With Zero Dark Thirty I think Kathryn Bigelow did a complete cop-out to be perfectly blunt. She threw around all kinds of different issues in the movie, but never quite gave any of them a conclusion. In the end that's why people think this is a pro-American, pro-torture movie. I think what she wanted to do was give an unbiased, politically correct view on an topic that deserves the complete opposite. This is a very exhausting movie, not because of it's length, but because it's presented factually, which in turn makes all the characters involved not very likable IMO. BUT I have to say, that if you haven't seen it, that you must. I think everyone should watch this movie. I don't really have a reason, except for I guess that there is in fact an underlying message, that is perfectly encapsulated in Maya's face in the last seconds of the movie. You know that saying that goes ""A picture is worth a thousand words""? I think those last few minutes of looking at Maya and Hakim's (Fares Fares) faces pretty much sum it all up."

It has an interesting story, a realistic feel, and a likeable main character. Despite all of this though whether for its length, lack of excitement, or my personal feelings I did not enjoy it that much. I think it is boring. It was like going to an art museum and seeing this painting everyone was crowded around. You go up to the painting to see what all of the fuss is about and you are like what do all see in this. It is alright but it is nothing spectacular. That is exactly how I feel about this film along with Lincoln and Argo. While the film is well made I personally did not enjoy it that much. If it did connect with me it would have certainly gotten an 8 but because of my boredom throughout the majority of the film it gets a 6. It is ok. Not a bad film and is well made but personally I did not find it that interesting.

Acting was very well, but aside from the pay out, nothing is really wonderful with this film."
281,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/zero-dark-thirty/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,ClariseSamuels,"Apr 9, 2013",6,"In Jean-Paul Sartre's story “The Wall,” a political prisoner who is sentenced to death is given the option of betraying the location of his comrade in order to live. He gives the police a false location thereby gaining a little more time before he is executed. To his shock, his execution is canceled.  Unknown to him, his comrade had been moved to a different location, and he had inadvertently given the police the correct information. Whether or not he could enjoy his reprieve is dubious--he had sentenced his friend to death, but without meaning to. For Sartre, the story had existentialist implications about mortality and the senselessness of life, but for Zero Dark Thirty, it illustrates an important point, which is that torture or threat of death does not yield reliable information, since prisoners will say anything to stop the pain or save their own lives. It is generally acknowledged that torture is ineffective besides being immoral, inhumane and illegal. Torture is outlawed by the United Nations Convention against Torture, which has been ratified by 47 countries.

Nevertheless, it would take hours and hours of research to try to figure out when and where the CIA used torture, and it's not clear if it continues to this day.  There has been an outcry questioning the veracity of Zero Dark Thirty, which depicted torture in a callous and shocking way worthy of the **** and their Gestapo tactics, with no suffering, remorse, or emotional reaction on the part of the agents who inflicted the torture. In one scene, when one of the torturers is being transferred back to head offices, he  admits to burnout simply by saying, “I've seen too many guys naked.” Too trite and not very funny.

The focus of the rave reviews is Jessica Chastain's performance, which is understated, yet dramatic and regal. And for Americans, the film provides an opportunity to be seen as the good guys, having taken out the criminal who orchestrated the death of 3,000 people, mostly  innocent civilians, on 9/11. But there are problems with the character of Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, who may not exist in real life and might be a composite of several female agents. In the film, she is a young woman with steely determination, but with no personal life or past. She has no love life, there is no mention of family, hobbies or interests--she was recruited out of high school and has done nothing but devote herself to long hours of office detective work. When witnessing torture, she has no reaction and no feelings. One character notes, “Washington says she's a killer.” But having been recruited for office work right out of high school, it's clear she has never seen battle and has never killed anyone. She's a bright kid who does her homework, she's determined, but she has no personality and no past. So she's exceedingly dull, and even Jessica Chastain could not work around that problem very well.

In one scene, at an executive meeting, when asked who found the safe house, Maya replies, “I'm the motherf***er who found the place.” In an interview with ex-CIA agents, it was noted that if an agent said that at a high-level meeting to a CIA director, the agent would be fired immediately. Because Hollywood types constantly use the f-word in every conceivable part of grammatical speech, they think everybody does, and they assume that intelligent people are rendered inarticulate without it. There were other inaccuracies in the finale as well, which were remarked upon in interviews with the Navy SEALS.

In any case, the perfection of this movie was marred by historical inaccuracies and the almost unwatchable graphic torture scenes which were inappropriate for high-quality cinema, having been taken out of any kind of moral, artistic, or symbolic context. Perhaps these scenes focus attention on the acceptance of torture, thereby helping to bring it to an end, but it still does not make for high art or good cinema. There are other off-camera ways to depict this critical moral issue, such as showing the political fallout and the ill effects on the people who had to do it, as well as the long-term effects on the victims."

In a movie like The Dark Knight the length of the film is forgivable because it is so excellent, but this film is just painfully boring. Secondly the main character Maya is one of the most dull and shrill main characters I have seen.

Non lo si dovrebbe fare, lo so, ma un film che narra la caccia e l’uccisione di Osama Bin Laden uscito a ridosso delle elezioni negli Stati Uniti (per quanto io abbia tifato Obama) qualche cattivo pensiero lo suscita. La visione non smentisce i sospetti, anche se le qualità cinematografiche della pellicola consentono per un lunghissimo tempo di passarci sopra. Dopo un prologo con le voci dell’undici settembre, l’agente della CIA Maya  cui Jessica Chastain offre un’interpretazione monolitica in cui le emozioni faticano a filtrare a parte la bella scena finale  viene catapultata sul ‘fronte orientale’ e, grazie a un’intuzione, trova fra l’immensa mole di dati e di piste il bandolo della matassa che conduce al nemico pubblico numero uno. Ovviamente, all’inizio nessuno le dà retta ed  solo grazie a una cocciuta ****, ai limiti dell’ossessione, che l’Agenzia si decide a seguire le sue indicazioni: si deve però muovere il direttore in persona  James Gandolfini in una parte piccola ma efficace. Lo sviluppo dell’investigazione  narrato in circa due ore in cui dominano i caratteri del cinema di ****, tra false piste, errori fatali  ci va di mezzo la Jessica di Jennifer Ehle, assai più empatica della protagonista  tanta pazienza e un pizzico di inevitabile corruzione. La sceneggiatura di Mark Boal procede attraverso una serie di capitoletti, in apparenza poco legati fra loro ma che consentono uno spostamento progressivo che avvicina sempre più al bersaglio: Bigelow inquadra il tutto in maniera fredda, quasi documentaristica, ma le belle scene di colorata vita quotidiana in Pakistan non evitano la rigida divisione fra buoni e cattivi. In tutto questo si inserisce anche una questione troppo presto abbandonata: presenti quasi solo nel segmento iniziale  quindi riferite alla prima metà dello scorso decennio  le scene di tortura sono brutali, ma la condanna non  proprio chiarissima, lasciando la non gradevolissima impressione che le sevizie, pur non essendo una bella cosa, a volte, servano. In esse si distingue l’agente Dan impersonato da un bravo Jason Clarke, che dà vita a un **** interessante diviso com’è tra bisogno di normalità e compiti violenti. Finito il suo lavoro e tornato a casa, però, sparisce quasi dal radar: uno dei pregi del film  il fatto che il punto di vista e il motore della storia siano prettamente femminili, ma a volte questo ha come conseguenza l’eclissarsi delle figure maschili. Dopo centoventi minuti di robusto intrigo **** –che non spiegano i peana della critica e le nomination multiple, ma sanno comunque avvincere  inizia la missione notturna destinata a stanare Bin Laden dalla sua casa-fortino: quasi tre quarti d’ora di visori a infrarossi, porte fatte saltare e colpi di grazia a corpi già cadaveri che sembrano non finire mai. A parte la bella sequenza del volo notturno in elicottero, per il resto i tempi potevano venir tranquillamente dimezzati senza perdita di informazioni e con un notevole guadagno di ritmo narrativo. Qualcuno, forse appassionato di tattiche di commando, considera questa la parte migliore del film, ma per me finisce per danneggiarne il giudizio complessivo: ‘Zero dark thirty’  un buon lavoro, anche coraggioso nell’affrontare una materia ancora viva, ma che non riesce a essere all’altezza delle aspettative."

Also, I'm wondering why this movie was made anyway and it didn't answer any unanswered questions. I sincerely hope everyone involved in this doesn't end up in danger due to the sensitive subject matter. I was led to believe that the final half hour was going to be an amazing action sequence but it was such an anti climax and the most quiet ""action"" sequence you'll ever see. The fact that we know what's going to happen means there is no element of shock or surprise.

For me that film was just plain tedium and I gave up  after twenty minutes.  I enjoyed 'Point Break' as a teenager.  Any film with a character called 'Bodhi' is a good thing in my book.  I found 'Near Dark' to be a fresh take on the vampire story, but remember thinking at the time that the machismo posturing was somewhat puerile and undermined the romantic aspects of the story.  Having recently re-watched a portion of it, I found its dialogue to be cringeworthy.  Having now seen ZDT I can confirm that, although her cinematic capabilities have improved no end, her work with actors is still her weak point.  The characterisation was weak, and her earlier gung ho preoccupation of proving herself in a man's world is just, well embarrassing.  Resorting to profanity does not make you tough.  I can't help but feel that Bigelow is trying to compete with her ex James Cameron on the action stakes.  Their shared enthusiasm for an explosion and the technology of warfare is very apparent here.  I also found the film to be amoral.  I wouldn't give the film any credence and say that is dangerous, as it's only a movie, but to be this detached and dispassionate about such a delicate subject just feels plain wrong.  I'm only a lay person, and don't know the ins and outs of the actual story, but it did have the unmistakable whiff of propaganda to me.  Personally I felt that Chastain just wasn't strong enough to carry this movie and wasn't convincing at all.  On the plus side, I liked the way that it showed mistakes being made.  If anything, the message of this film was the dangers of being given too much responsibility too soon.  It also portrayed the pressure that is placed on women when afforded additional power over the natural sway they have over men.  Although a long film it did pass quickly, but made for uncomfortable viewing throughout.  I would say that the coda to this film is: I just want to go home, as I did at the end of it all."

I certainly don't need a movie to be exciting all the way through (hell, I love Downton Abbey), but Zero Dark Thirty is anti climactic, and overall quite boring on ALL levels.   While I don't agree with romaticizing torture, I would never let that aspect effect my judgement of the movie.   The movie just ****.  There's really no other way to describe it.  It ****.

The torture first act is brilliant, and I'll be the first to admit that it made me question the decision to stop waterboarding as it led to the information that eventually captured Bin Laden.  The second act, which displays Chastain overacting in a far reaching and ultimately current-events-heavy procedural disappointed.  Its inclusion of commentary on the Obama administration was both negative and positive, which stayed politically neutral.  The only redeeming factor of the second act is that is shows the consequences of CIA decisions in real time.  The third act, the operation, is extremely disappointing, as it was neither directed for intensity or tension, both things I am convinced Bigelow has immense talent in.  The potential for tension was wasted by poor editing more than direction or writing, but I can't go into detail without giving spoilers.  Chastain was in way over her head, as she did not hit the tone correctly in more than one scene, even though she was the lead and is nominated for everything.  Great moments, average total."

This statement is fair enough in itself, but a movie is first meant to be entertainment and other considerations are secondary. A documentary, on the other hand, is first factual and then hopefully also entertaining. Zero Dark Thirty is for the most part too complex to be easily understood from a historical point of view and, on the whole, to slow too be first rate entertainment. Even the last 30 minutes or so which shows the navy seals storming the suspected hideaway fortress of Bin Laden fails to be either as exciting or as informative as a recent documentary on the subject called ' Bin Laden: Shoot to Kill'. For me this documentary steals Bigelows thunder with its richly detailed reconstructions and dazzling insights into the whole operation. Zero Dark Thirty, unfortunately, never gets to cinematic grips with an unsatisfactory script that whilst not pandering to its audience, nevertheless treats them with contempt by leaving out many more interesting and revelatory details than it puts in."

The tension is palpable and evokes all the appropriate emotions--in the beginning. But as the movie roles on it almost seems like it's forgets what story it's trying to tell or why it's important to tell it and seems to miss it's own point behind tired military cliches which often appears as a substitute to actual character development. ""I believe I was spared do I could finish this."" This being killing Osama. It's this lame, lazy attempt at character development makes all the characters feel like flat, one dimensional unlikeable people with any specific motivation beyond Jessica Chastain's character eventually deciding halfway through the movie on revenge. The acting is solid all around and, even though I am a fan of hers (Tree of Life, The Help), the great performance isn't Chastain, who comes across as stiff and not believable as a tough C.I.A interrogator (adequate at best and mediocre at her worst). It's Reda Kateb the man who is tortured for the first third of the movie and the only character you ever feel anything for or who comes across as a complex, real human being. As a fan of The Hurt Locker I was ready to like this movie. I was ready to LOVE it. Unfortunately it falls short in almost every way and often it's just plain boring. With all that having been said I do think people should see this movie because I think the real life details it offers are important, it's just everything about the presentation that leaves a lot to be desired.

Seriously, they could have cut about a dozen establishing montages by half or entirely, and made the movie 2 hours shorter. The whole thing felt a little melodramatic and it it wanted to be like The Year Of Living Dangerously or All The Presidents Men, and have that grit and docu feel, but the dialogue was laughable, and emoting seemed artificial. I am stunned at the fanfare behind this movie, it's almost like it's being touted as so the world watches it, and sends some sort of perverted message about the tenacity of the US, or like, don't mess with us thing.

But I felt that it needed to give Maya, the main character, more of a personal life and identity to make up for the fact that (obviously) we know how it will end. Both of those shortcomings  make it less thrilling than ""The Hurt Locker,"" in my opinion. I wondered if the torture aspect had been blown out of proportion by the media controversy about it, but must admit that those scenes were disturbing."

The problem with this film is that, Bigelow and Boal want to say so much and yet, they confine themselves too a two and a half hour window. Boal shows just how much a fish out of water he really is here. The script is a tempermental mess, introducing one character only too abandon them for another as soon as any character development begins to form. The story itself jumps from plot point to plot point with out any real meat between the set peices. The closest comparison would be a Michael Bay film, in terms of the organization of the film. You see their is really no plot development, no actual emotional connection to anything one sees in this film. Instead, what you get is a series of events held together with padding. Like Bay it seems Boal wrote the big set pieces first and then linked them through shoddy narrative structure. The set peices mind you are amazing, but everything in between is just lazy filler. At least Bay tries to infuse his filler with some energy but ZDT, nope. The padding is a barren waste off missed opportunity. Jessica Chaistain is the most evident in this sense of dull acting. She just stands around and looks mildly discomforted by everything. Mark Strong and Jason Clarke are the only ones who really do any acting. In fact there are only two scenes that really have any life too them, the first being the one where Strong's character, George is first introduced. There is fire there is energy, life and then... Bigelows drops it all and goes back to morose mild discomfort until the last chunk of the film. The end of the film is really well done. And that is where you see that beyond the ending, this film is simply just another Body of Lies. It's almost as if Boal wrote this first, in a flurry off maddening genius and Bigelow directed five minutes after he handed it too her and then they wrote the rest of the film. All their energy gone into that last forty minutes, Though as much as I lambaste this film, considering the overly generous praise given to it (especially considering the high quality of The Hurt Locker), it does present an interesting premise. It would have made one hell of a miniseries! Boal even separates the individual acts almost as if they were episodes. And Bigelow directs each act as if it is an episode of an HBO miniseries, yet sadly, its not. Instead we have a bloated film, from a writer who couldn't figure out how to write this story beyond scripting the Abbotobad raid. It's a great story. It's just on the wrong screen."

Americans are not often treated to such subtle portrayals of the region- in fact, this is the first Iranian film I (and probably many others) have ever seen. For that, I am glad to have seen A Separation. Accurate representations of other cultures are always fascinating. And yet, I did not enjoy this movie. Almost everything about it- the acting, the direction, the editing, the dialogue- was superb. Technically, it is a masterpiece; a tightly wound, densely layered film made with a degree of finesse rivaling the best efforts of Hollywood's elite. And for all that, it fails, as do most films of the cinema verite style of filmmaking, for one simple reason: nothing good happens. It starts bad and goes downhill from there. There is nary a single ray of hope, optimism, or humor to lighten the relentlessly grim, depressing atmosphere that pervades A Separation from beginning to end. By the halfway point, it is apparent the film has been written in such a way so as to prevent a happy ending. The characters have gotten themselves so entrenched in their problems that redemption is out of the question. I am of the belief that the ""life ****"" attitude so common in modern filmmaking is merely an excuse for lazy storytelling. It is easy to make things hard on your characters. It is even easier to make them harder. To resolve these issues in a believable and compelling manner- and to avoid sentimentality and predictability in the process- is a real challenge, and one that that many filmmakers, unfortunately, choose to avoid altogether. The consequence of this artistic lethargy is a hopeless, unresolved feeling in the viewer's gut that persists for hours, days even, after the credits roll. That is not why I- and many, many others- go to the movies. If I want to feel like crap, I'll read the news, thank you very much."

On the positive side, it did provide an interesting window into contemporary Iranian life. It did present some very challenging dilemmas and some interesting character studies. It was interesting to see how men and women navigated the problems in an ostensibly male-dominated culture. It did stimulate good conversation after it was over. In it's positive qualities, it shared with The Descendants all of the things I've mentioned so far except the ""male-dominated culture."" On the negative side, it was a half-hour too long. None of the four main adult characters (the two couples) were easy to relate to and none of them demonstrated much growth as individuals across the length of the film. I'd contrast it very much with The Descendants in which difficult problems were presented but there WAS clear character development--the characters in The Descendants evolved and grew. In The Descendants, both characters and plot developed. In A Separation, IMHO, the plot develops but the characters do not. My advice having seen the film last evening? Discount the rave reviews about 40%. Ask yourself the question--do I like movies set in interesting places and presenting difficult dilemmas experienced by interesting characters who don't seem to learn or grow much from the events in the film? If the answer is yes, and clearly for many reviewers and users it was, go see the film."

However, it is still a thoughtful watch and it has a nice tone to it, as did the other 2 films. Its not especially overly sentimental, its a philosophical watch of sorts but this one features more in the way of arguments/disagreements. Its disappointing to see how Jesse and Celine have become, disillusioned I suppose. However, the script is certainly decent and I enjoyed the scenes showcasing the Greek oudoors - its a lovely setting and the characters have plenty to talk about, its just not as perhaps romantic or hopeful as in previous films, which is part of what I liked about them. It seems weird to say that, in as much as I wouldn't think of myself as an especially big romantic film fan as such. However, it wouldn't be fair to say there's no positive side at all present in this film but I won't elaborate, so as not to provide any spoilers. Its not entirely a simple plot line but its still a good watch. I especially enjoyed the scene featuring the two main characters and (I assume) friends and relatives around a dinner table outdoors, enjoying a (I assume) Greek lunch while discussing a number of interesting topics. It manages to be quite an atmospheric watch, as the previous 2 films were and indeed I liked the Greek music played while the credits rolled.

In Before Sunset, they reconnect in Paris nine years later, engage in more charming dialogue, and are a couple by the end of the film.  In Before Midnight, nine years have passed again, and Jesse and Celine are now a middle-aged couple with twin girls and a lot of relationship baggage - mostly centered around Jesse's son and his ex-wife.  They still talk endlessly, but all the chatter has lost its charm.  They talk their way through a sunset, talk their way through foreplay, and finally talk themselves into a big fight.

Alas, I can't even say that I liked it!

Two main reasons this film didn't resonate with me nearly as much as I expected are that: I didn't find the vast majority of the characters to be interesting, and I couldn't see why this is considered to be a slice-of-life film in the first place.

The only character I was almost constantly interested in is Yang-Yang. I found the relationship between N.J. and Sherry quite absorbing and engrossing as well as the scenes with N.J. and his Japanese friend; I can't say I really cared about the character of N.J. as I was supposed to be.

I couldn't care less about everything related to N.J.'s wife, teenage daughter, brother and business partners. Apart from one scene N.J.'s wife shares with N.J.'s mother that was a bit emotional, I found the film emotionally flat and almost fell asleep every time I see these above-mentioned characters. I found the story-line of Ting-Ting to be one of the most boring and uneventful I've seen in any film. Let alone the fact this film is 3 hours long!

A slice-of-life is a term used to describe a piece of art or literature that shows or depicts the ordinary details of real life. And I'm enamored of any film or novel that can be classified under this, so to speak, sub-genre. The thing is I couldn't see that Yi Yi fits this description. What I saw, in the first 30 minuted in particular, are many of uninteresting characters acting in an absurd way. I really couldn't see that this film has mundane real-life events as most people do.

Slow, dreadfully dull, and as precise as surgery, Mr. Turner is a film that is marvelously directed, acted, and shot, but sitting in the DMV has proved to be more engaging. This film's cinematography is other worldly and cinematographer **** Pope has provided some of the best shots of the decade with his work here. Unfortunately, the film is skin deep. It is like a hot girl that thinks she is smart, but is actually really dumb and lacks personality. I rarely call a film pretentious, but I feel as though Mr. Turner fits the bill. Hollow and packed to the brim with self-importance, the appeal of Mr. Turner is wholly lost on me. It gets as high a rating as it does from me for a few reasons: the aforementioned cinematography (particularly the slow pans from characters to shots of scenery are brilliant), the costume design, and the production design. All of these leave the film being a visual masterpiece of the highest order. Yet, the story elements and character elements are all beyond lackluster and lacking any sort of depth. The writing here is quite poor and the film is overlong. It would have been well served to actually develop its characters and cut some of the runtime.

I like the film best when it depicts Turner’s work as an artist, when it mirrors the visionary landscapes of his painting, and when it surveys his relationships with the art and artists of his time. I’m less interested in his domestic arrangements, manners, and health. In fact, the whole “brute with a sublime soul” business seems rather cheap and obvious, as most artists' lives look messy, sad, and coarse next to their art. I agree with reviewers who claim that the film is nearly an hour too long, though we probably wouldn’t agree on which scenes to cut. I think most viewers will concur, however, that “Mr. Turner” is not a film for small screens; if you can’t see it in a theater, then hold out for a large high-resolution video screen.

If only they could have cut away one hour, this would have been an amazing piece you'd remember and cherish. There are so many scenes that didn't really add to the story telling.

Really, in the grand scheme of things, what does it accomplish? A big battle scene to preserve the sacred city of Gondor, a recruitment drive in the land of the dead to facilitate the former, Frodo and Sam's arrival at Mordor and the big finale beside the lava pit. Some exposition can be expected, naturally, and in a few scattered cases it does serve to enrich the extended universe, but for those four primary points to devour over four hours of screen time seems ridiculously excessive.

The wealth of character moments in Return of the King are well done, but rarely do they feel as essential as they did in previous chapters. With very little exception, the primary cast has already worked through their individual arcs before the first scene, so there isn't much meat in that respect.

As with The Two Towers, the skirmishes (scattered liberally throughout) are appropriately epic and pulse-pounding, though these too push the limits in terms of what the viewing audience is willing to let slide. We're already suspending our disbelief a fair distance in regards to the fellowship's universal fighting prowess, but one particular scene with Legolas and an elephant seems more than a bit excessive. In fact, Legolas is granted an especially silly amount of battlefield respect throughout the series.

I could dwell on the negatives all day long - I haven't even touched on the stupid amount of slow motion in the farewell scenes - but at the end of the day, this really isn't a bad film... just a madly bloated one. It feels rewarding to finally conclude our journeys in Middle Earth, and when the plot finally gets around to waving goodbye it's a powerful experience. I just can't help but wonder how much better a slim two-hour cut, trimming half the body fat, would play to the same material. Oh, and its status as a Best Picture winner? Clearly that was a lifetime achievement award, because The King is far and away LotR's weakest installment."

Take the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, for example.  In the books it's basically a showdown between the forces of Sauron with the Witch-king leading them, and the forces of good with Gandalf in command.  The destruction of the Witch-king is a pivotal moment in the story, and greatly cheapened in the movie.  It's impossible to know why a hobbit stabbing the Witch-king would have any great effect because they left out the Barrow-blades.  They might have at least explained it afterwards, even if they just used ""Elf magic"" as a lame excuse.

And there's no dramatic showdown between Gandalf and the Witch-king like in the books.  In the movie, Gandalf's staff breaks and that's about it.

Anyway, it's somewhat enjoyable overall, even if it's like ""The Lord of the Rings"" for the mentally disabled."

The formula it uses is- Build up to battle - Battle - Build up to battle - Battle - Half a dozen endings. This may be one of those rare examples of an adaptation being too faithful. An extremely accurate adaptation doesn't always qualify as a good one. A film stands on its own. It can't justify its flaws by leaning on the book.

The first half of the movie is slow as Llewyn ping pongs around the Village and New York, causing disruption everywhere he goes. Oscar Isaac unflinchingly plays the dislikeable title character a, sincere to a fault because it impedes upon his ability to be successful, freeloading folk singer newly solo due to the suicide of his duo partner Mike. Frustrated, dejected and broke, he leaves on a road trip to Chicago and the story’s components converge to a chaotic culmination one expects from an Ethan and Joel Coen film.

Teeming with talent and thoroughly Coen, the movie is full of quirky characters of a beatnik persuasion. Unfortunately, with the rare exception, most portrayals are forgettable – Carey Mulligan, John Goodman, and Garret Hedlund included. Justin Timberlake is ultimately the least successful of the bunch and his casting is a misstep. His acting is an out of place self-aware parody of a folk singer from the 1960’s.  With the exception of Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, whom most know as the love interest of Lena Dunham’s character in Girls, is hilariously sincere and scene stealing in the minor role of Al Cody.

Inside Llewyn Davis contains all the successful ingredients typical of a Coen Brothers motion picture but is lacking the charm that typically enamors viewers. It is artificially bleak, reliant upon post-production, and fundamentally contrived.

358,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/inside-llewyn-davis/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,ClariseSamuels,"Apr 7, 2014",5,"This film might be better entitled, “Inside the Clinically Depressed Mind of Llewyn Davis.” If the world of music is often overglamorized, Ethan and Joel Coen have gone to great trouble to completely deglamorize it so that just about everyone who participates is a loser. That is, unless you happen to be the one person in the room who wins the lottery, such as the young Bob Dylan, who is briefly depicted at the end of the film as one of the neophyte folksingers who gets a break at the well-known Village nightclub, called the Gaslight Cafe, designed to be a public showcase for new talent back in the 60's. Beat poets like Allen Ginsberg gave readings there, and the Gaslight later metamorphosed into a club for folk music, where many young folk singers got a start.

The swarthy and handsome Oscar Isaac, playing the title role of Llewyn Davis, does a superb job of depicting an angry, frustrated young folk singer who plays the Gaslight but just can't get a break anywhere, even though he briefly captured a recording contract when performing as part of a duo with a partner who later committed suicide. That is where the depression in this movie begins. Going solo, Davis cannot collect royalties on a single recording or attract the attention of a single agent. As a libertine and free-thinker who is self-absorbed and who lives for the moment, he has no spouse, no children, and no place to live. He crashes every night at the homes of friends, including a couple where he seduces his friend's wife (Carey Mulligan) and accidentally gets her pregnant. Because she only wants her husband's child and not Davis's, she requests that Davis pay for her illegal abortion.

The critics had high praise for this film—in terms of making a film depicting someone who constantly makes bad decisions and leads a destructive lifestyle, and who is probably suffering from undiagnosed depression that causes him to explode into foul-mouthed tirades, the Coen brothers have done a good job. But since it is never clarified that this is a profile of mental illness, it becomes an unrelentingly stark and grueling portrayal of a talented young man who is on a hopeless downward spiral. Davis's self-centered and egomaniacal personality is such that he is unable to care about anyone but himself. He can't even be trusted with a cat. Three cats suffer from Davis's sociopathic indifference to the fate of others. There is not a single spark of sunshine in this man's life. His friends are at best friendly rivals. The woman he impregnated despises him. He is alienated from his sister and his nephew; his father is in a nursing home that is, like everything else in this film, dark, gloomy and joyless. Davis has no real desire to communicate with his father, and just as well, because his father is in the late stages of dementia and merely sits and stares blankly into space. The only sign of life is that his father soils himself while Davis is visiting, as if we needed more proof that everything in Davis's life is malfunctioning.

Davis's finances have also broken down catastrophically. He has no money to buy a proper winter coat or a pair of boots. He is always freezing to death and malnourished. But when well-to-do friends take him in and ask him to play a song at dinner, he erupts in rage for being treated like a trained pony, when clearly he doesn't perform for free; he only performs to “make a living.” His day job was that he once worked as a merchant mariner, and when in desperation he tries to go back to sailing, he is, as always, met with insurmountable obstacles.

I would not want to give away the ending, but there is no ending to give away. The ending starts over at the beginning. There is no redemption to be found here; no lesson to be learned. Except for a few songs that lift this film out of its perpetually bleak Weltanschauung, this story is purely the heavy-handed tale of a tragic hero who has no one to blame but himself."

I wish Llewyn's '****' personality shared more of the comedic genius that Walter Sobchak possessed (probably impossible to duplicate or compete with).  Llewyn came off as a hopeless musician with an unpopular talent that would forever be shadowed by Bob Dylan.  If I watch this film again, I'll probably catch more and I'm sure it will grow on me.

Don't feel bad if you're watching the film thinking ""I just dont get it"". The message is so blunt and ham fisted, its not you it's the poor script. ""Religion is bad, Capitalism is bad"". But the reality is anything without boundaries or that pushes to the unrealistic levels of extremism demonstrated in this movie are ridiculous.

There are different perspectives shown via people with different personalities, although most of them are quite challenging for the teacher to engage with. I thought the performances seemed quite realistic and I suppose it's a good platform for discussing the themes it covers, including pupil peer pressure/bravado, tolerance, acceptance and how teachers respond to the way pupils 'act out'. There's discussion of the balance between positive encouragement for good behaviour versus punishment for negative behaviour. It may make you see things from other peoples perspectives and so I think it's a good film but it may seem a bit dull for some perhaps - its got a reasonably slow plot pace and I'd suggest its perhaps good as a film to discuss afterwards, rather than an entirely entertaining and 'fun' film as such but it has a pretty solid feel to it, so I'd recommend it, although it won't be for everyone."

Its a very strong film, violent and a little difficult to digest. The reason for the title is not immediately evident but it ends up being perceived with the progress of the narrative. Beginning in a very elegant way, this one develops in a intensely and densely, constructing suspense around the three central characters. The ending, however, seems a little too sudden after so much dramatic tension, and so we get a little dissatisfied and expecting something more that never comes. The central characters are assured by Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem. The three of them were excellent, each in their own way, but Bardem stood out as a villain, with a deep, somber interpretation but holding the entire film around him. I believe that with this film Bardem has proved himself to be a great talent and has a promising future if he knows how to run his career well. The leadership is assured by the Brethren Cohen, in a dense register and away from the sarcastic comedies to which they have accustomed us."

Tommy Lee jones se révèle excellent également dans son rôle de vieux flic blasé mais se retrouve en porte-à-faux puisqu'au fil du scénario, on constate qu'il ne sert à rien, à part pérorer comme un vieux con. Et ça, c'est embêtant d'embaucher une pointure comme Tommy Lee et de ne pas l'exploiter.

Embêtant aussi ce gros coup de mou dans le dernier tiers du film, alors qu'on croit la résolution arriver à grands pas... qui ne résoud rien et se termine en fait comme un gros pet avec deux majeurs pointés à la face du spectateur.

En vérité, les Coen ne font qu'aligner une longue série de meurtres (gratuits pour la plupart voire glauques) et un bon paquet d'hémoglobine juste pour faire monter le tirage, attirer l'attention et faire... rire (?).

La réalisation est comme toujours avec eux, très soignée, mais perd de sa superbe à porter tout le poids du besoin de provocation de ses auteurs qui à force de se débattre finissent par s'enliser dans le cloaque assez dégueulasse qu'ils ont créé. Quel gâchis !"

It is a great looking movie and some interesting scenes especially the shootout where Llewellyn and Anton first butt heads, but that's about it. First off, I thought Anton Chigurh was a terrible character. Everyone says how menacing he is, but he's just ridiculous. Secondly, I don't get Tommy Lee Jones significance.

The fact that this movie doesn't have any composed music until the credits shows it's power. It's as if composed music isn't needed. The problem is that the scenes make you want to see what's going to happen next, then as the movie progresses it's as if you're taking a mid afternoon nap.

Over a million of the accused lost their lives in this genocide, many sent to a speedy demise on the back of fabricated evidence, and fifty years later, the executioners show little remorse. More the opposite: in recalling their hands-on role in the murders, the old gangsters beam with pride, freely share the secrets of their methods (a garrote, for example, means less cleanup) and boast of quadruple-digit kill counts. Filmmakers loosened these lips by promising artistic freedom in a cinematic retelling of their old handiwork, but it doesn’t seem like the killers needed much convincing. They’re thrilled by the opportunity to shout their guilt to the world and can’t (or won’t) accept the possibility that they’ll be seen as anything less than the honorable, patriotic heroes they are in their own minds.

It’s a surreal experience, watching these men speak so openly about such loathsome acts while toying with their grandchildren and flaunting their collections of tacky crystal tchotchkes. Their audacity is baffling, but also hypnotizing. Doubly so when the conversation spans months and we begin to spot blemishes in that front of self-assuredness. As production of their own fantastical, self-directed short film concludes, we see the flicker of guilt blossom into a full-blown crisis of conscience for at least one participant. This doesn’t keep him from gleefully applauding the absurd, colorful, playful song and dance number he’s helped create as commemoration of his life’s work. The same short meta-film climaxes with an executed man expressing gratitude for his own murder.

The Act of Killing is a genuinely shocking film; a rarity in the modern climate. Its bare depictions of self-deception are haunting, especially when contrasted with the fleeting occasions its subjects are finally, truly honest with themselves. I didn’t enjoy this and I don’t even know if I’m glad I watched it. An important document, but not a pleasant watch, it’s one you’ll absorb in stunned silence and soon try to forget. While it falls short on technical and cinematic levels, its sources are incredible and its message cuts deep. Just don’t be misled by the cover art. This is some dark, dark ****."

Le gars et sa compagne qui tentent de résister à l’expropriation de leur terrain par le maire corrompu en savent quelque chose… lui qui pour sa part se retrouvera pauvre comme Job et plus accablé par le mauvais sort que Job lui-même (non, pas Steve Jobs, connard, suis un peu…!) alors qu’ironie suprême, même l’église orthodoxe entretient d’excellentes relations avec la mafia locale,euh je veux dire le gouvernement local (aide-toi et le ciel t’aidera… mais aide-moi d’abord).

« Leviathan » est un film très intéressant malgré cette ambiguité vers la fin (il a fait quoi le pauvre gars au juste ? on ne sait pas….) par sa froide ambiance et sa vodka frappée qu’on écluse à chaque occasion… et surtout lorsqu’on a des problèmes ! Mais malheureusement, la lenteur du film est rédhibitoire : elle réduit presque à néant -mais pas complètement, Dieu merci- tous ces beaux efforts de dénonciation du pays mafieux et de la patrie vodkaïenne.

I had a major problem with the decisions of the characters in the film. Also the movie is not tight enough. Overall the storyline is weak. it just didn't have that hook, that special intangible aspect to make it a cool movie. It was just sort of bland and the acting was just decent in my opinion except for yves montand of course.

A main problem of mine was how vogel and corey met in the first place. That whole scene was just too much to be coincidental. I didn't buy it at all. In fact I thought the entire thing had been arranged beforehand somehow, which would have made a way better plot line. But to tell me that vogel is running, checks the trunks of all the cars and just happens to find corey's open is too much. And then corey, a man just released from prison, goes right along with it without skipping a beat.

This movie is just a long, slow, weaker version of Rififi. What is most bothersome is that instead of the crooks being cool and crafty, they are lame and blundering. No wonder the movie starts out with them captured or in jail-- I'm not surprised (and they ended up dead-- duh, saw that coming)!

Other ridiculous things:
""Hey I just got out of jail-- how about I buy a car with dirty money from a rival criminal?!""
""Hey, let's recruit the new gang member at a known hangout for gangsters!""
""Hey, we can poorly tie up the guard right next to the alarm button!""
""Hey, let's leave the rope ladder with our fingerprints all over it hanging from the roof of the jewelry shop!""
""Hey, let's steal millions in jewelry and have ONE possible buyer for it all!""
I could go on and on... (continuing with the fact that the tip of this ""easy heist"" came from a POLICE GUARD!).

Yves Montand actually is the onlycharacter that's interesting with any sort of depth in this entire movie. And at least he's not stupid enough to die by getting SHOT IN THE BACK while RUNNING AWAY!

Le Cercle Rouge is an interesting film to have seen, but i have no intention in rewatching it. It's way to dry to be entertaining or interesting. Melville's other work Le Samourai, is one of my favorite movies of all time though"

Ainsi, par exemple, Russell Crowe dans son rôle de grosse brute tabasse et refroidit tout ce qui semble suspect mais c'est pour la bonne cause (celle de la veuve et de l'orphelin mais surtout la veuve). Non, il n'incarne pas un truand aux manières si peu délicates mais un flic, ""le superflic"" bourru et bourrin. Et ses collègues ne valent guère mieux : soit des branleurs, soit d'autres ""soupes au lait"" qui n'hésitent pas à mordre la ligne jaune et même la hiérarchie complaisante cautionne... la justice triomphante, bordel de merde !

Franchement, c'est drôle mais je crois que c'est une drôlerie involontaire. Puis on se rend compte que la Basinger qui joue les vamps ne sert strictement à rien dans son rôle de pétasse de luxe qui voit défiler tous les michetons de la Crim', remontés comme des pendules. Tellement mauvaise que t'en chiales de honte pour elle.

Puis on s'aperçoit que l'intrigue veut rebondir : elle commence à sortir un lapin de son chapeau et s'étire en longueurs et en conversations barbantes qui n'arrivent plus à faire avancer quoi que ce soit. On ne s'amuse plus et on trouve le temps de plus en plus long : que cela reste entre nous mais L.A. Confidential devient alors considérablement rébarbatif. L'histoire tarabiscotée part en vrille et tout s'effondre lamentablement.

La baudruche a donc éclaté et la sanction est tombée. Dommage, car les intentions étaient bonnes."

442,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/three-colors-white/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,drqshadow,"Oct 5, 2024",6,"In losing his wife, a Polish expat is also stripped of his dignity. Shamed for his impotence before a divorce court, he’s summarily evicted from his Paris home, ousted from his post at a high-end hair salon, disassociated from his bank account and deprived of his passport. While living as a vagrant in a nearby subway station, fate introduces him to an amiable businessman who takes pity and finds a way to send him back to his motherland. There, he intends to set things right: pulling himself up by his bootstraps and seeking a twisted measure of revenge against the woman he holds responsible.

Roger Ebert called White an “anti-comedy,” but I don’t see much humor here. He likewise labeled its 1993 counterpart, Blue, an anti-tragedy, and while that story ultimately becomes uplifting, it does supply a boatload of tragic circumstances to underscore the point. Maybe Ebert was just stretching to find a unifying theme for the trilogy. I haven’t yet watched the third entry, Red, but while the first two chapters are similar in many ways, they’re antithetical in others. Where Blue was about growth through introspection, weathering an intense personal storm to find peace, White documents a more spiteful alternative. Here, our protagonist soaks up all manner of undeserved pain and dishonor, then uses it to fuel a burning, vindictive fire. He grows, too, but in unhealthier directions. The trauma deadens his nerves, nudging him towards greed and self-gratification at others’ expense. That many of his targets probably deserve the abuse is beside the point: he’s been willingly corrupted by his hardship.

It’s a bleak and somber story, filmed in bleak and somber tones. The frigid, wintery climates of France and Poland feel stark and bare; dreary settings for the film’s unhappy, borderline-hostile, subject matter. Curious that a film named for the essence of light could produce something so dirty and dark."

It appears to be pretty much universally praised, yet it's a flawed film. I'll concede that it's beautifully filmed, that Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give great performances and that the relationship between their two characters is sweet and endearing, as a tale of two lost souls finding a connection is always compelling. Despite these positives, the film puts forward an extremely patronising, stereotypical and borderline racist view of Japanese culture. By depicting a steady procession of carefully cherry-picked Japanese ""oddities"", it's almost like the film's main objective is to say ""hey, come laugh at the silly Japanese, they're not like Americans at all"". A recurring joke in the film is the mockery of Japanese speech pattern of the replacement of the letter r with the letter l. This gag is barely funny the first time it is used, but it is reprised four or five times throughout the film. In one of the key ""comedy"" scenes, Murray's character struggles to understand a heavily accented Japanese director during a photo shoot, and his mimicry of the poor man's voice to decipher each instruction isn't funny, just embarrassing, akin to the lack of logic behind an English-speaking tourist abroad raising his voice to make themselves understood to non-English speakers. To make matters even worse, the film is all-too-often slow or just plain boring. Beyond great chemistry between Murray and Johansson and striking aesthetics, the appeal of Lost in Translation is, well, lost in translation chiefly thanks to some criminal cultural insensitivity that really shouldn't be applauded in the modern world."

But when the special effects and less-than-thrilling action began to appear and the immaturity of the script became apparent, I realized that my first thought was a mistake.

Personally, I expected a gentlemanly and intelligent story from this film. Partly because it is based on a British work, but also because I was fed up with American films that were all showy special effects and not very interesting stories. However, I have never seen the original of this movie, but perhaps it was not as American as this movie. I thought it was an intelligent and great movie, but it was all special effects and action. As the movie progressed, the value of the movie gradually diminished.

Another reason is that there was nothing intriguing about the story. None. Nothing. The foreshadowing that was scattered in the beginning of the film was collected without any interest. No matter how much action was developed, it just ended with ""huh"". It was half-hearted, boring, and not as enjoyable as I would have liked."

I mean, his lordliness removes people leaving the rest stuck in dangerous situations. I imagine an open heart surgeon suddenly whisked away while operating. Yeah, unlikely as he or she is probably an atheist or Korean: both not eligible. But you know..that kind of situation. In the movie a driverless car smashes into a shop and a small plane crashes into a mall. To hell with those left behind! Well, not hell.. unless they were actually all moved downstairs while the rest went to the attic. I tried to look it up, but the bible is a boring mess. A bit like this movie.

I wonder what happens if you happen to be operated on and you are abducted. You'll arrive with your internals hanging out? Taken from the movie you'll probably arrive naked in heaven surrounded by mostly kids as kids get in for free. All these little naked kids. Most without parents:

Where... where are mam and dad?

They... are not here, Sweety... you see... They were not good Christians. Not like us!

But... but I am not either... I am not a Christian either! Or I wasn't..

Yeah, we know.. but you are a kid. Now, be a good boy...

I don't want to be a boy.. I want to be a girl!

Shut up, or we send you back when you turn nine!

I mean, doesn't that sound weird? Like icky weird? And if you missed out because you had your birthday today you'll curse the supreme one for the rest of your life.. or eternity.. whatever takes longer. Why today? Why not yesterday? Only a **** would do that!

And have you even heard god say sorry? Of course not. Which also makes him a ****.

But how do we know it is even god?  Why not aliens? Or the devil. Or the Vogons? No, it must be god, so we are told.. Because of reasons. It is like they the probably conducts trials. Who did it? The black guy in the trench coat! What is your evidence? Well, it is what we believe.

But the logical reason why it must be god is clear: only a **** can make a **** move like that. And god is a ****. So who else could it have been? And a worldwide panic sets in. It says a lot a how myopic the makers of this movie must be. Considering the percentage of the world populace that is eligible to go up it should be nothing much at all, unless god also feels obliged to take all the kids away from the entire world.. including babies. Filling the heavens with toddlers of all religions and convictions.. and none. And being a toddler for all eternity.. that must be fun! Are you sure this is heaven? The conclusion is inevitable: god must be a ****.

I am  surely overthinking this all, but I like to as it is so funny to imagine how this nonsense must work.  Little thought has gone into this movie. Suspend you reason, because that is the way to watch movies. And how can you believe this nonsense anyway? The moment you start to ponder things it starts to unravel in a funny way and you can go either of two ways. Saying that this is so bizarre it must be nonsense or saying that this is so bizarre.. and then make a full stop right there. Let's face it. Down to earth this movie is mostly harmless. Mostly, for you run the danger of being bored to dumbness. It is fascinating really, how boring you can make a movie. It has a really cute female lead, but she is really boring. And Cage is in it. And even he is boring. Nothing really happens. But... but.. how about the plane: it is about to crash! Yes... and what is so exciting about that? Of all the plane crash movies it is by far the most boring.

Most of the time this movie is people talking and pretending that they are undergoing emotions of some kind. Oh and people stating that it must be the rapture, with a grave mood. Desperate the female lead contemplates even suicide. God is a big **** but he likes kids. That is what the movie tells us. Well done there.

You know what is funny? The people who made this movie and a sample of viewers probably think they will be raptured themselves. They can be sure that they won't. Would god reward people who take pleasure from the suffering of others? From those who are left behind? It is very likely he wouldn't. But then he might cause he is a **** after all as the movies tells us.

You know what is double funny? God wouldn't be raptured either. Or do mass-murdering sadists get to heaven?

Having read reviews before watching this I had low expectations but it's not actually that bad. Yes the plot could be slightly better and the film does come across as ""Budget"" at times. The main character is a pilot played by Nicolas Cage and I thought he done well considering.

(NO SPOILERS) The film is basically themed around the Rapture where loads of people just disappeared into thin air only leaving there belongings behind. No one knows why this has happened apart from a minority who are seen as mad or going mad. Most of the film is set on a plane where the crew and passengers are confused but have to deal with technical problems with the plane and they have to try and get back to an airport whilst they are over the Atlantic.

This is basically a Mystery/Aviation film with a little bit of Action as well.  (That's the way it came across to me)

At times the film came across as a little bit narrow minded and didn't have as much action as I thought it would. I'm not sure if this was a budget movie but it did come across that way sometimes and I felt they could have made a bigger impact, for example there could have been scenes showing the global impact of people going missing just so you got more of a sense this was global rather than being concentrated on the plane all the time.

Overall an OK film and not as bad as you think its going to be."

Quando chega em casa ela não diz nada a mãe.

Bom, começando pelo enredo, é importante saber que o filme não retrata o que acontece no livro ""apocalipse"" da bíblia, e sim tem apenas como cenário os acontecimentos. A história é razoavelmente boa, porém um pouco mal contada, a relação entre os personagens é fraca, e a atuação mediana. Isso deve ser levado a sério, afinal Nicolas Cage é um dos atores, e é um dos únicos a ter uma boa atuação.

Os efeitos, tanto visuais e sonoros são ultrapassados, o filme da uma impressão de ser antigo, principalmente pela qualidade de imagem, mas isso não chega a incomodar, logo nos primeiros 5 minutos de filme você se acostuma.

A trilha sonora é simplesmente horrível, mas ""quebra um galho"" em alguma cenas.

O filme poderia ser bom, mais muitos tropeços não permitiram isso, por começar o nome do filme, o filme não mostra realmente um apocalipse e sim um ""pré-apocalipse"", as imagens divulgadas não batem com o filme, isso da uma impressão de que fizeram o filme só pra lucrar. Enfim, pra você que não da atenção a efeitos ou trilha sonora o filme vai ser ótimo, porem para os mais atenciosos vão se decepcionar, no final de tudo, vale apena assistir ao filme, mas fica esse avisos citados acima."

The movie does indeed require that, both for the nonreligious and for those not agreeing with the literalist and future-looking interpretation often favored by Evangelicals in particular.

In overview, the movie has an odd disparity of quality between broadly the first half and the second--it almost seems as if an entirely different producer took over midway.  The general presentation of the first half seems rather amateurish.  The dialogue is generally wooden in presentation and simplistic in writing quality (from my after-movie discussion with someone who knows, it does not correspond with the books).  It does serve as needed exposition for the characters one will be expected to know well enough to feel some concern for later in the movie, but one gets the sense of production values more on the level of a local play than a big-budget Hollywood feature.  The first half lacks even anything notable in terms of soundtrack, which it seems it could have definitely benefited from.

The second half is considerably better, and led by Cage's acting capabilities (which are noticeably and persistently categorically higher than anyone else's in the film) does reach moments of affecting drama, and gratefully, a quality soundtrack backing finally kicks in.

This sequel is even cheesier. We get goofier performances, worse dialog, and uglier special effects. The plot goes into a bunch of mystical mumbo jumbo. It tries to go grander in scale than it's predecessor, but it all just leads to poorer writing.

We still get the entertaining fights though. The movie definitely doubles down on the fan service. Just like the first movie it's strength is in watching the game characters fight each other with over-the-top action. These fights are backed up by an awesome soundtrack.

It tries to go bigger than it's predecessor and ends up falling short as a result. It also gets quite a bit cheesier. However when it's focusing on the first movie's strengths (cheesy martial arts action with fan favorite MK characters) it's still pretty entertaining. The expanded roster of characters taken from the games still makes it worth a watch for fans of the series and of the first movie. The lack of R-rated fatalities is still a disappointing non-inclusion, but no more so than it was in the first. Overall the movie just isn't as good this time around."

Okay, this film is not a good one. But honestly, I didn't think it was as bad as everyone says it is. For me, the worst film in the franchise was the second on the list. Anyway, this film is bad, and that is indisputable. With him, it seemed, definitely in a definitive way, a franchise that had an unusually long life, considering the type of films presented.

The biggest problem with the film is not being funny. The jokes are within the standard of the franchise, but they are lukewarm, they bet a lot on eschatological humor (I don't know what's worse, that or the obsession with sex that abounds in teen comedies) and the fact that we easily predict them takes away from them grace. Some satires (like the one made for the films ""Mama"" and ""Cabin in the Woods"") did not work, although the script also seemed to me within the standard that the franchise has accustomed us to. There was a lack of a more competent and funny cast, in addition to the firm hand of a director capable of demanding more from everyone involved. Zucker, who signs the script, is good at making comedies when he can do anything he wants, and he has already demonstrated it, having been responsible for ""Scary Movie 4"", for me the best film in the franchise. But he is not alone here, neither in the direction nor in the script, and I do not know how well the joint work went.

The cast is amateur, to be nice. I don't know where they were recruited, but what gives the film some life is decent acting and Ashley Tisdale and Erica Ash alongside some of the cameos: the opening scene, with Linsay Lohan making humor out of her own personal misfortune , it just doesn't become infamous because she's comfortable with it, and Snoop Dogg doesn't seem to know how it got there."

John Travolta's acting was, as usual, awful.  You expect a powerful voice to come out of that enormous face, and especially when he's on stilts as he is in BE.  However, Travolta has a brittle, high-pitched, shaky voice.  It's no good for an actor.
Especially for the main character (and I feel he was the main character).

The story was good, but the transitions from one scene to the next were the worst I've seen from any movie.  It reminded me of a 60's TV sit-com show, like I Love Lucy.

The special effects were not the worst I've ever seen, but they were not good.

The main good guy has the perfect face for an actor, and he does a great job.
His lover girl is also good in the movie.

Forrest Whitaker did a good job, except for the evil laughing.
Most of the other actors were pretty bad.  Some of them were god-awful.
I think especially of the pilot in the jet who saw his buddy get shot down, and he yelled, ""Nooo!!""  It was terrible acting, like he was trying to keep his voice down so as not to wake the people in the neighboring studio.
There were a couple other scenes like that with terrible acting.

You get what you expect. His movies have no good stories, acting or coherence. The only decision for you is if it is just really bad or so bad that it is entertaining. For me I enjoyed this movie while I must admit that it is a guilty pleasure. I should have not rated this above a 3 and even that is maybe to good. Overall a silly and enjoyable movie. I must say that I respected Uwe Boll and say you should learn from him because he had success. Machiavelli said something like “Learn from the sucessful people no matter if you like or dislike them because they know the game”."

As such I expected it to be a lot worse. It's still a bad movie. The acting is terrible, the plot makes no sense, the action is too ridiculous for its own good, and for what's supposed to be based on a horror video game franchise there's no atmosphere or terror to be found. It's just that unlike so much of his later work I didn't find it painful to sit through.

That's because this came out around the beginning of Boll's career when he was still making movies with the best of intentions. Meaning it's free of things like his genuinely frightening political ideologies, the toxic personality he developed in response to the overwhelmingly hateful criticism he received from his detractors, and the overbearing self-defense blanket of unjustified arrogance that only served to make his following flicks that much harder to watch. Alone in the Dark is just an extremely unsuccessful attempt at a big Hollywood blockbuster from a man who, while likely able to recognize a good film when he sees one, had no idea how to actually make one.

564,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/boyhood/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,Piscaso,"Oct 8, 2015",2,"So this is one of the most boring movies ever made. No, I did not dislike it because it was long. I don't mind long movies. First, the cinematography is fine, the dad and the mom were great but that's pretty much it. The boy is the most unlikable character I've ever seen a movie be completely about, that wasn't trying to make the character unlikable. The early parts were fine, it had a sense of slow progression but looking back a mere 45 minutes you realize so much had happened since then.

If anything, the idea behind the film is the best part: watching a boy grow up before our eyes. This is done well. But when the boy is a jaded **** for the majority of the movie (once he becomes a teenager) it's just bad. No matter how much work the crew did, or Richard Linklater, if the movie **** then it **** ****.

I'm assuming people like this movie because of the obscenely high scores it gets and sort of a lemming effect, but I encourage you to look at the movie critically and objectively.

I saw some people giving it a 10/10 because it had no melodrama, which is okay in some cases, but I would rather that this movie have a bunch of melodrama than the multiple flat scenes with awful writing. I think he was trying to be hip in a few scenes but it just fell flat. The movie has a clear aesthetic and tone, and it's pretty clear what he was trying to do. And I applaud the work he put into it. 12 years is a long time to work on a project. But that doesn't change the fact the kid is annoying, nothing interesting ever happens (even though multiple times it seems like it's going to).

Another thing I find wrong with it is the fact that it's 3 hours long. Again, nothing wrong with 3 hour movies, in fact I enjoy them more because they usually have a longer and usually more wholesome story (which Boyhood had admittedly). But there were so many points that it could have ended on. There were multiple scenes where I actually thought ""and this is the end I guess, wow that was a great ending"" and then another scene starts. The actual ending itself was actually pretty bad too. They did LSD in a valley or something and then it cuts to black. The car ride to college was a much better place to end. Speaking of which, there were a lot of other things that seemed like they would lead to more interesting things but never did. I won't go into detail in case you still want to slog through it 15 months later.

My final beef is that every side character that gets only one scene, or is only in it for a short time is intentionally unlikable, but in a manipulative sort of way. The drunk abusing father, the unencouraging teacher, the ""cool"" older kids that peer pressure, etc. Richard created these two dimensional characters to create the illusion of adversity. To make a sense of drama or progression. That he proved them wrong or something. But as I watched it I felt like he was just throwing cliches at me to try and get me to care. There were other side characters that weren't like that though. Imagine how everyone in a restaurant sees you as an extra in the story of their life. But they were also just two or one dimensional, and rarely got any development.

The family (mother, father, kid and sister) were really the only ones with development. The sister was trash, and only there in the end because she had to be, and was probably just the lesser of the awfulness that is child actors at the beginning who auditioned. The kid was as I said before unlikable and annoying. But the parents actually had some depth and the actors did an incredible job with their material.

I will end on a quote that I think sums up this movie perfectly:

""This is the most true to life movie that's ever been made when you think about it. When you get to the end you just want to die.""

Sure there are some good things, Patricia Arquette for example, but otherwise it's slow, dull, uneventful and boring. It's a nice idea, but the only time in the film where my interest was mildly spiked was when the glass is thrown and maybe the next 10 minutes. Originality does not compensate for the 3 hour waste of time Boyhood is. At even at that Boyhood isn't that original, it's essentially does what a TV series does, only that compressed into three hours, without any significant comedy or drama, with dull and generally annoying characters and a generic story. This is probably the most overrated film ever, it ****, it was boring and slow and I'm not being petty, I'm not saying that I like it less because of it's critical acclaim, I'm simply saying it's a terrible movie, that may have worked  by being relatable, (although it's so boring even if I could relate I would still want to shoot my TV), and original, but not more than that, it just isn't well rounded, it doesn't have the balance between relatable and interesting, and that is what the goal for this film should have been"

It's as disjointed a film as you would expect from the way it was filmed over such a long period, it doesn't struggle to be coherent because there's absolutely no challenge in that respect for it to do so. There's nothing artful about the way the film is put together, it's a sequence of moments, which makes sense if you think about the last scene, a scene which tries to make this profound link, like a series of moments with nothing really changing but it feels flat, and again maybe that is the point, that it should feel flat and banal because that's more realistic but the film also tries to be something else by having several linking scenes with sombre indie songs playing in the background, the songs are so tacked on and don't reflect the mood well at all. Whether it's his character or just bad acting, Mason is underwhelming, and so is his sister through most of the film, funnily enough they both seem to act better as young kids, but as they grow the cracks start to show in the performances, I get they have been directed to act as naturally and realistically as possible but it comes across as just awkward bad acting in some scenes, which should have been cut or edited better, the editing was the worst thing about the film, far too many pointless cuts and lingering shots that do nothing, one sweeping shot is so bad it sticks out like a sore thumb. The editing was poor in terms of the sequence of moments as well, it was a basic timeline, but it was put together with no flair. In my opinion the best thing about the film was Patricia Arquette and her character, she was a very realistic mother, and the nuance to her performance reminded me of my own mom, I thought her performance was the best in the film, Ethan Hawke was good as well, and he absolutely carries the scenes with the kids. I don't think it should be viewed as groundbreaking just because ageing happens to the characters, it should be judged as just another film, I was ready to enjoy this film, and I found it relatively enjoyable, and it wasn't that the pacing was too slow, just that it felt monotonous, the film gets better, it has peaks and troughs. Maybe i'm missing the profundity of the understated realism that is the films essence, but it would feel more profound for me if i looked through some of my own family photographs and reminisced, the sentiment was lost on me, I didn't feel it but maybe that's because i have a cold stone for a heart"

I had to fight myself to finish it.  I agree with all the comments that this was an ambitious project.  Twelve years to make a movie is, if nothing else, an exercise in patience.  I think it is an admirable accomplishment with the best of intentions.  However, all the effort provided absolutely zero benefit to the lackluster story.  The story started bad, then it got worse.  I can see no other reason for all the positive reviews accept for the fact that it was such an ambitious project.  All the ambition in the world did not make the product any good.  Using the same actors as the children aged did not add any value to the movie.  What was the point?  It was just a bad story.  What makes in more annoying is that they had twelve years to put together a good movie and this is what we got!?  I have nothing against Patricia Arquette but her performance was certainly not worthy of any specific notoriety.  The only reason she got an oscar was for commitment to the film but certainly not for her performance.  It has been a long time since I have been mad that I wasted time on a movie but today, I see my streak is over.  I am flat out pissed that I wasted my time on this movie.

Those claiming that this is not for mainstream audiences, because it is an artistic concept film overestimate the film. And possibly underestimate the audience."

The movie is filmed such that the main character is filmed at age six and is continuously filmed over a 12 year span until he is 18. A seemingly endearing concept however is ruined by the fact that him and his family are entirely unremarkable and they do absolutely nothing remarkable throughout the film. There is no engaging story arc, difficulty to overcome or goal to achieve. For anyone who has lived a life of their own, this film has nothing to offer, no insights or revelations and certainly no entertainment. Certainly there is a reason why films aren't normally made about normal people living normal lives, it's because we live those everyday and don't need a theater or disc to see it. The acting is poor as well. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette do a fantastic job, but the acting roles especially from the children are inconsistent and forced. Much of the dialogue is awkward and out of touch with how youth used to talk as well. With one liner 90s clichés scattered throughout. It's a subtly racist film as well. Despite being set in Texas, the one and only Hispanic character is first seen doing manual labor. This movie does have one notable aspect: Because this movie is nearly three hours and nothing notable happens at any point, it begins to drag unrelentingly about an hour and a half in. This movie is however fascinating in one aspect: A movie can be made about unremarkable white people doing absolutely nothing remarkable for nearly three hours and still receive near unanimous praise, critical success and an Academy Award nomination. Bravo white people, even the most unexceptional of you are truly are amazing."

It was like watching a liberal campaigning for office bringing up just about every liberal hot topic to push down the throats of its viewers.  As expected, because of this the liberal media and Hollywood will love this movie, hence all the Oscar nominations.

It would be nice to see a movie that had no political overtones (liberal or conservative) to it be nominated once in a while, but that is not what drives Hollywood.

With that being said, it was a brilliant idea to film these characters over an 11-12 year period.  There was just no storyline and it ended making you fell like you were waiting for there to be some type of conclusion and/or wondering if you missed something.  After watching the movie a 2nd time, I realized I did not miss anything, because there was nothing to miss.  There was no point to this movie except for watching the characters grow up physically.

- film too long (3.50h)
- film too boring
- film has poor story

The users which gave negative critics also pointed out some positive thing found in the film similar like:
- film has great photography (desert scenes/animal scenes camels, horses...)
- film has some great acting performances (but boring story and very long scenes spoiled my interest)

MY CONCLUSION:
Like the most of the negative user critics I had very similar experience. I was actually very disappointed because I've read so many good critics from users before I watched this film all saying it is EPIC film but as I watched it -> partially/fully overrated... It deserves only three stars and no more. I shoul next time read aso the negative critics before reading positive to see the difference. But likely the critics which are many places consistent and repetitive are likely ""genuine critics"" or real personal experience. Im not sure if all this positive critics found on board are ""truly genuine critics"" because film making is big money today much bigger then before we are talking of billions of $$$...so what to think... I learn every time something new... one has to seems read also the negative comments/ratings and if there is consistency there is great chance of genuine viewers experience it means I may also not like this film.... chances are 50-70%...."

It was in the top 10 of the AFI top 100 movies of all time, and it had received many 4 star reviews. About an hour into the film, I fell asleep. Now, fans of the film would say, ""Oh, you can't handle the impact of a long epic film. You have a short attention span."" Well, with me, that is not the case. But, on the subject of length, this film is almost four hours long. For the content displayed in this film, the running time was way too long. If Titanic can cram all the hefty things it needed in a matter of 3 hours, then this is no excuse. Nothing was happening. I mean, literally nothing. The screenplay needs a real doctor, because it has so much unneeded dialogue. It just procrastinated its way through, I think because it really had nothing more interesting. Director David lean is probably one of the best directors of all time, but in this film, you can tell that his and the producer's mind frame was ""I wonder how many academy awards I can get through this film?"" It wasn't made naturally, it was gargantuan for this point. I about turned off the movie when I saw a thirty second look at the desert landscape for about the millionth time. Yes, it does take place in the desert, but this movie was called ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" not ""The Arabian Desert."" Which brings me to my next point: Peter O' Toole. I have seen him in many marvelous performances. I'm surprised he hasn't received an Oscar yet. But, his interpretation of Lawrence was so vague. You only saw the exterior, you never saw the interior. He gets a rush out of killing, yet we don't know why. i partially blame it on the script writers, but I also partially blame it on him. When you are an actor, you have to convey to the audience who you are, no matter how good or bad the script is. he is playing the character that embodies the whole movie. It is solely about him, and he doesn't sell that. Now, I'm not going to bash everything just because I don't like the film, but i will compliment Alec Guinness for his outstanding but short performance as Prince Feisal, Maurice Jarre for the superb score, and the editing.  Sorry to burst the bubble of the ""Lawrence of Arabia"" fans, but I really think this film is overrated, and that it is not as good as it is made out to be. That is my opinion on ""Lawrence of Arabia."""

In fact, the fetus scene is like the videos of slaughterhouses they make to convince people to become vegetarians. Regardless of the stance it takes, it doesn't really go about it in a thought provoking way. The one thing I did appreciate was the idea that the one girl was willing to accept the doctor's offer for her friend. It was an interesting statement about friendships, although it's possible that that just happened by accident, and that the writer wasn't really even thinking of that.

628,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/12-years-a-slave/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,Broyax,"Oct 24, 2017",3,"Ce film est vraiment bizarre : il montre avec un certain recul, presque une neutralité (d'ailleurs bienvenue) les horreurs de l'esclavage tout en évitant un pathos excessif et lourdaud comme on peut souvent en trouver à Hollywood dont on sait la propension à faire couiner les violons au moindre prétexte dramatique.

En même temps, il s'appesantit souvent dans le tire-larmes de bas étage mais sans jamais réussir à nous tirer une larme, car la détresse nous apparaît trop éloignée, trop floue et superficielle. Et trop scolaire également. C'est naturellement très paradoxal comme impression et cela nous chiffonne à dire vrai pendant tout le film jusqu'à la fin qui peine aussi à nous émouvoir, trop expédiée et bricolée à la va-vite.

Sans doute le livre de la victime, de ce miraculé est-il plus à même de restituer l'enfer vécu que cette adaptation qui souffle le chaud et le froid. Et pourtant, quelques scènes sonnent juste et la réalisation très travaillée est assurément élégante.

Hélas, cette élégance devient trop souvent maniérée et si statique qu'elle semble engluée littéralement dans la mélasse du film intello qui tient à dispenser son message comme un forcené... alors qu'en fait il se regarde le nombril à intervalles réguliers pendant de longues minutes.

Ce qui m'amène au gros problème de rythme du film, soient deux heures et quart qui en paraissent quatre... un double problème puisque le rythme fictif en pâtit aussi : on ne ressent pas le moins du monde ces douze années terribles qui font l'effet de douze mois, tout au plus. Un comble.

En outre, la musique de Hans Zimmer qui recycle éhontément ses vieux thèmes d'Inception est assez énervante : est-ce qu'on ne va pas voir une toupie à la fin ? est-ce que tout cela est ""vrai"" ? nous voilà donc aux antipodes des intentions du réalisateur, j'imagine.

Dommage donc, car le début laissait augurer beaucoup mieux. Il reste tout de même quelques séquences qui font mouche et le jeu de Fassbender en véritable état de grâce mais 12 Years loupe le coche."

I understand how important this subject is, especially in the US, but there are other ways to popularize the abolitionism than giving the best picture prize to a mediocre movie. But maybe it's a best mean to bring an idea to the popcorn-fed audience.

The story starts good, but later the potential is wasted. The movie is surprisingly shallow and predictable. Almost all tense moments are brutal scenes. And an overdose of scenes when the camera shows nothing but people starring somewhere(which I guess were meant to provoke some reflections) is just annoying.

638,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/12-years-a-slave/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,englishrose,"Jan 31, 2014",1,"Once again Hollywood waves its sanctimonious wand over history with this glossy movie about slavery in the United States. Like a self-righteous teetotaler telling off an alcoholic, it is a sentimental, holier-than-thou piece that challenges you to criticize it or ´you’re a racist too´. Following in the footsteps of Django it uses the excuse of history and a worthy theme to justify gratuitous scenes of violence.

The film begins in the home of the central character, Solomon Northop, a free black man, who lives a genteel life with his family in New York. The director is clearly eager to get to the gory bits though, and within the first ten minutes Solomon has been kidnapped, enslaved, and the audience is cringing under a close up of his contorted face during a twenty minute whipping scene; the first of many to come.

The film continues in this vein, as we follow Solomon’s journey through an array of increasingly evil slave-owners. There is a segregation of personality in the film, with most of the black characters being good and moral and the white ones evil. Surely it is as patronizing and insulting to assume personality is dependent on colour as it is politically correct. At least the same cannot be said of gender, the white women are as evil as their male counterparts. However no film about slavery is complete without our token good white guy, and Brad Pitts rises to the occasion, strolling in bearded and ready to play, once again, the hero.

One does wonder why Solomon doesn´t send a letter under his ´mistress´name on one of his frequent forays to the shop. (Of course, his one attempt to run away is thwarted when after two steps he stumbles on a lynching scene). Perhaps the point the director is trying to make is that Solomon is too broken and scared to do this. He is too proud, however, to pick the cotton quota demanded by the sadistic slave-owner. A necessary contradiction perhaps, as this allows more whipping scenes as he is punished daily.

Or why, instead of trying and failing to write a letter with a blunt bamboo stick and watery juice, he doesn´t simply use the candle end and stain the paper instead. But it is not a film for the details. Nor the historical overview.

It is two hours of increasing brutality, culminating with a horrendous scene where one girl is whipped until her flesh is exposed. Instead of taking one of the many examples of modern day slavery however, which could leave people feeling guilty at inaction, it is set far enough in the past that it allows the audience to do their cinema time, and leave feeling as worthy and sanctimonious as the director."

Absolutely dreadful acting by a good majority of the cast; even worse the cast was filled with stars so the acting should have been top notch. The overall development of the plot was terrible. It felt as if they just wanted drama for the sake of drama. Almost every scene had dramatic sequences amplified so much, to the point where I couldn't think of an even worse synonym for the phrase 'absolute horror'. And yes, they did have a few rather convincing and emotional parts, however, nearly all of the film was so unintelligible and lacking of any credibility, that those few parts become distant memories linked to ideas of what the film COULD have been.

It's kind of entertaining, sure, but not in a way that makes you want to watch it again. It's just kind of there and a tad formulaic. It even feels a bit exploitative (it's a film about life in slavery with an astonishing number of recognizable names in it, but no one who really *fits* into the role. ""Dirty Pretty Things"" portrayed a few similar themes *FAR* better, and the protagonist was even likable.

I recognize the ability to be objective and rigorous in the report made, and it is quite unusual to find a film that resembles both a documentary or a major journalistic report. However, the way it was conceived and its high-contrast cinematography make the experience of watching the film truly tiring.

Directed and written by Gillo Pontecorvo, the film addresses, in very broad lines, the effort of the Algerians to resist French colonization and conquer the independence of their country, in one of the most striking colonial conflicts that France faced. However, the way the film approaches the subject could not be worse: instead of building a fictional story on top of historical facts, the narrative is dispersed and, if most of the time we follow in the footsteps of a specific Algerian terrorist, the script proved to be unable to focus on this story and to avoid unreasonable or accessory considerations. Furthermore, and while the film tries to be neutral, the sympathy for the revolutionaries is evident.

The cast is satisfactory, but it's made up of names I don't know. Brahim Hadjadj brought to life the most notable character in the film, a member of the Algerian resistance, and was happy in his effort. Technically, it is an uneven film, with a neo-realistic aesthetic, but an excessively crude cinematography, of high contrast, tiring for the eyes. The sets and costumes are fine and the film is quite authentic, and the soundtrack does not bring anything remarkable."

The only praise anybody ever gives this film is how ""visually stunning"" it is. It seems as if plenty of intelligent people have mentally devolved after seeing Gravity, because apparently substance no longer matters, and visuals are enough to make a good movie.
The characters in Gravity don't need to be there. I might as well have watched a movie about pieces of metal floating in space. Oh wait, they have that! It's called ""Space Junk""! You know, I heard that was the original working title for this movie, too!
The story ****, to put it plainly. Sandra Bullock's story is completely generic and uninteresting, and pretty much occupies the entire film after the rather intense opening. Let me be clear, I don't want to dispute that the movie is breathtaking on a technical level, but without any interesting motives or characters, and absolutely zero valuable ideas or concepts expressed, who cares? Apparently everyone. Go watch Transformers, you mouth breathers.
Graphics don't make the game good, pretty colors don't make the painting good, and being catchy doesn't make a song good. Visuals don't make a movie good. Sometimes, they make it awful. Gravity is awful."

As expected, both the script and acting were really poor - any high school drama club would have done much better job.
And what a load of clichés and cheap thrill unloaded to top it off!

The reason why I did watch and why I wanted to write the review is the undue praise by science community. This flick is NOT sound scientifically at all. There are multiple mistakes and flaws in logic. To list a few:
- The GPS satellites could not be taken down by the same event (they are at a lot higher altitude).
- The sound does not conduct in vacuum, which they stated, but for some reason could not resist putting in the movie.
- There is a huge misunderstanding of momentum of motion. And after boosters are activated in the Russian pod. Both the pod and Bullock travel at the same speed - there is no way for her to slow down with a little canister of fire extinguisher (to say nothing about the fact that activating booster would not be controllable and landing at Chinese station is virtually impossible).
- The astronauts do not wizz by around the station and would not be able to float from station to station.
- In general, there are a lot of childish scenes about the space stations: they can't chat via the microphone after station is destroyed (they are not on cell phones in there). Stoned Sandra would not be able to hack into Russian capsule computer to fool it... or activate Chinese satellite for that matter.

I will give a couple stars for cinematography and for an attempt to stay true to science, but instead of praising this meek stab at sci-fi, people who can think should discard it as a worthless Hollywood fluff."

Sandra Bullock's acting was terrible and unconvincing. And, she looked like she was constipated most of the time. George Clooney came across just too perfect for such a life and death situation. He was too much like a saint in outer space!

I also felt mightily deceived by both the film's movie trailer and by the official news media critics that fawned all over this pitiful movie! Gravity is so tame and lame you could take a child to see it without a second thought! It certainly won't offend a soul on planet earth!

Watching this movie you want to use terms like cool and awesome because, technically speaking, this movie is magnificent and awe-inspiring to watch. The purely computer generated images of the vast abyss of space, a cusp of Earth’s surface and a gleaming sun astronomically farther away in the background is spectacularly beautiful. With limited knowledge of space and aeronautics, this is about as real as I can imagine, though I know experts disagree – I’m looking at you Neil deGrasse Tyson. Beyond the aesthetically pleasing set design, I find little else in this picture remarkable.

While beautiful, its artistry in scenery makes the film detached and voyeuristic. Gravity starts almost immediately with the collision and has very minimal character development initially. These factors led me to be unable to suspend disbelief and truly immerse myself in the story nor become invested in the main character’s survival. Further, the plot is tired and worn out. Several movies of a similar plot precede Gravity - which is basically a disaster survival story in space (most notably 2001: A Space Odyssey and Apollo 13, among others).

I can’t help but imagine the executives at Warner Bros. and how this film came to be:

We need a hit film, a huge money maker, but something new, fresh!

CGI, its all about that CGI, that’s what sells movies…we’ve just got to take it to the next level!

Yeah, but we’ve done just about everything on earth…

That’s the problem! On Earth…space! Brilliant, and we will make it in Imax, get even more money for the tickets.

Yeah, but we have to get actors that get a huge draw in the box office.

Who is hot right now?

Robert Downey Jr.? Angelina Jolie?

Nah, Jolie has something scheduled already. Downey probably won’t want to do it, he’s too improvisational, won’t be his style.

We could get Clooney? Everybody loves George.

But what about the girl? Who won best actress last year? Jennifer Lawrence? Too young. Meryl Streep? Too old. Natalie Portman? Not likeable enough. How ’bout Sandra Bullock? Sandy will probably do it.

But who is going to take the risk of making this movie? It could tank. Well, he will have to be a relative unknown, but made a hit before, international, so hungry to break into mainstream Hollywood. Alfonso Cuarón? I think he wanted to be an astronaut when he grew up. Isn’t he shopping a script set in space?

And the rest is history…

In all seriousness, the movie never connected with me, while visually brilliant, it is lacking in all other regards. If you are into special effects and the sheer technical breadth of the undertaking of that crew, whom I commend, then I suggest this movie.

691,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/gravity/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,robohannon,"Sep 10, 2014",1,"We watched “Gravity” last night – 90 minutes of drek. Beyond the special effects, which weren’t that special, the movie was clichéd and flawed from beginning to end.  It is a testament to how bad Hollowwood (spelling error intentional) has become at making movies that have some meaning and relevance.
First cliché, right of the 50s, was NASA’s choice of sending a neurotic female scientist into space. If NASA was hoping that this would help revive interest in supporting space travel, I think they should reexamine their public relations procedures.  There was nothing likeable about Sandra Bullock’s character, even after the movie “treated” us to a gratuitous strip tease  as she slowly sunk into a near catatonic state (either in sympathy with the audience, or because she was struck with the realization of what she would do to make her career relevant again.)
And then we have George Clooney as a retiring astronaut on his last mission. To call this a cliché would be cliché. To borrow from South Park, it was hard to see him, even in space; through the dense cloud of smug he seems to bring to every role. His character has seen it all, done it all, knows it all, knows how attractive he is, has something to say about everything- the man is not acting in this role, the man is just having an average George Clooney day.
Even if you were able to accept that the Russians would be somehow stupid enough to send a missile to destroy a satellite, knocking out all communication satellites (even their own) and destroying the space station they invested billions of rubles in, how can you accept that every other manned vehicle in orbit was somehow able to warn their crews in time and get them down safely except for the most maneuverable one of all – the space shuttle? Again, not a great promotional piece for NASA is the Russians and Chinese could send out the “ABANDON SHIP! “signal before NASA’s vaunted tracking stations should.
It only gets worse as Clooney drags Bullock to the wreck of their shuttle, so we can see lovely floating shots of dead people we never meet (it might have been a nice idea to do a few establishing shots in the shuttle), but who I felt more sympathy toward than the two nut cases floating in space.
Then Clooney drags her off to the space stations. On the way Bullock’s neurotic character manages to waste all her oxygen – even Clooney’s smug can’t stop that from happening. When they get to the station she manages to get herself in a tangle, but not enough of a tangle to save Clooney, who “gallantly” (read foolishly) unclips himself.
A pity they didn’t learn from being bounced around, and watching things bounce around, and from the fact that in space all you need is a sight force to move things, that a light tug on their tether would have sent Clooney right into her arms.
The rest of the movie is predictable. She overcomes the odds, displays her great ability to brood, and makes it to the Chinese escape pod (are you paying attention NASA?). She despairs as there is no fuel to start the engine, and decides to die. The Ghost-of-Clooneys Past comes to visit her, and gives her the solution.
We are treated to a reentry screen that has all the technical flair of the final scene in “This Island Earth” where the flying saucer comes to a flaming end, without the sympathy for the character that that movie engenders. Bullock’s character survives the watery landing, but is bound and determined to do one more stupid thing, and does it by blowing the side escape hatch off the side of the pod rather than using the one she used to enter the pod on top.
The results are predictable. The pod sinks. She, weighed down by her suit, has to take it off (there sound track should have at this point should have had strip tease music.) She struggles to shore. The movie at this point should have ended there, but we are “treated” to another soft-core moment of Bullock writhing in the mud.
She finally manages to struggle to her feet, and toddles off down the beach toward… the sunset, or something, well we don’t know. But the ending did reflect perfectly how I felt about the movie – it just toddled along toward…well, we don’t know. Between the cloud of Clooney smug, the bollocks of Sandra’s performance, and the 1950s B-movie feel dressed up in high tech effects, this movie, like gravity, ****. Hollowwood should be ashamed of how many awards this stinker won."

For a 91 minute movie one would not expect to be bored and wishing for it's termination, but that is how I felt about this movie. The story of this movie consists solely on a series of extremely unlikely and seemingly inescapable impasses, that 'somehow' are overcome."

The directing is subpar, certainly one of the worst Fincher films. It's incredibly dark, even during the day. It's as if I'm watching the movie with dark-tinted sunglasses the entire time. The screenplay is undeniably Sorkin. Conversations drag on for extended periods of time, often losing track of their main focus. It's clear there was some sort of disconnect between Sorkin and the director because Fincher just can't keep up most of the time. The music is annoyingly painful most of the time. It does nothing new within the ambient genre, neglecting original performances for a neglectful, dark atmosphere. Like the film itself, it is overrated.

Acting wise, Jesse Eisenberg does a great job, but only because he's playing what he's good at: himself; the nervous, meticulous, obsessive, socially-awkward nerd who thinks academia is what's most important in life. Everyone else is so incredibly bland, I wouldn't be surprised if there was no effort involved whatsoever.

Concerning the subject, the general idea is correct, but the specifics are muddled. I'm sure Sorkin realized halfway through writing how uninteresting sitting in front of a computer and creating Facebook really is, so he focused on the only drama throughout the entire experience: lawsuits. Unfortunately, they're handled poorly in the film. I have to wonder if it isn't fact-based, then why exactly is it focused on Zuckerberg and Facebook? I've come to the conclusion it was decided to use a much more overly dramatic, fictionalized view of the events and center it on Facebook because it sells. And my does it sell."

My first and biggest gripe was Jesse Eisenberg. He is a absolutely horrible actor. He ****, plain and simple. He tries so hard to be like Michael Cera, that he ends up failing. His role wasn't the best either. The character of Mark Zuckerberg is to put simply, a **** bag. I'm sorry I don't want to sit there for two hours and watch some guy think his **** don't stink. I was happy that Rooney Mara's role was very short because she is one of the most annoying actress's out there. The film in itself was just generic. I felt David Fincher was selling out so he can appeal to a younger audience. Everything else was just mediocre and overlooked. The only good thing was the script. It was fresh and crisp and the dialogue was witty and tight, but it wasn't enough to save this film from becoming, just like Zuckerberg, a **** bag itself."

I'm as much a fan of Sorkin's writing as anybody, and the dialogue rolls well, but you can't build a story on the backs of whiny, impotent losers who don't even struggle in their journey to build a ""business"" as simple as Facebook.

Performances were fine, and it looked great, but the story seems ridiculously overdrawn. To suggest that the creation of Facebook was built upon these moments of ""genius"" is outrageous. Could anyone seriously argue that the site is not a rip-off of Myspace and Friendster? Of course Z improved on the model, but it was hardly an original idea.

I'm not sure that I've ever seen a bunch of characters as dull as this group, and if I felt anything at all for any of them, it was slight disgust. The representation of business dealings was as inept as we can expect from the Hollywood-detached, but couldn't Columbia Pictures afford a consultant?

The acting is very solid and the style frames the pic as something that looks like a solid, profound drama. This frame is but a frame though. If you stop to think what this movie is really about you will see that the style is pure style, which makes the movie really shallow and superficial and the good acting a waste of talent.
The thing is, this is one of those movies that has no reason to exists, cause it shows nothing special, it inspires nothing, it adds nothing to the table. The movie is a long arrangement of scenes that do not differ a lot from what you'll see if you pay more attention to your grandparents or to the old couple that lives in the same neighborhood as you. Maybe to some extent the intention of the movie was to develop awareness of the limits of life... but it attempts so in such a boring, slow approach and it really does not work.

It is a very boldly done war film about all the individual consequences of a war, something that has not been a standard topic of the genre. Yet, I was bitterly disappointed by it all, as it proved to be a disgustingly blatant work of American propaganda, whereby their political aggression is presented as a burden to those that willingly participated it. Who the f**k cares about what the war did to someone who, under the pretext of 'liberalization and democracy', behaved like a bloody dictator? I was utterly disappointed by all the awards the movie gained and I must say that the critical universal acclaim somehow escapes me, as I don't see any relevant acclaim that should be attributed to the movie. It is slow, effectively boring and dull, one-sided and biased and it actually borders some propaganda work, but without the chauvinistic subtext. But, yes, the glorification of the American Soldier (just to make it clear - America is not the problem here, it is the glorification of a phenomenon that should be condemned and I would say the exact same things if the film was about Congo, Cambodia, Britain or Guatemala) is there and it is absolutely sickening (I actually fell asleep for 20 minutes and when I woke up I concluded that I haven't missed a thing - enough said).

I detested Jeremy Renner after seeing the movie and I was glad he lost the Oscar that year. In time, my opinion of him did improve, but the role was disastrous. It wasn't bad, quite the contrary, but the character itself, his portrayal and all of that combined with the movie itself was dreadful.

So, 'The Hurt Locker', albeit a well designed war film, offers little to nothing of the potential it has, becoming thus a propaganda work and the glorification of a war-raging policy that should be forgotten within the history books and not glorified on screen."

Clearly, it caught the imagination of the Hollywood Limousine Liberal reviewing establishment, who gave it very high marks and ceded it a number of significant awards.  But how good is the movie?  Not really that good.  In particular, the movie presents a very destructive and inaccurate portrayal of what soldiers are really like.  Nobody as reckless and irresponsible as the main character would last ten minutes in a special weapons unit of any kind, let alone one involved in demolition work. The fact that so many Hollywood reviewers accepted such a ridiculously inaccurate portrayal establishes that this kind of portrayal is currently Politically Correct. It is what Hollywood wants to believe soldiers are really like. A true work of art worthy of a best picture award would find the incredible drama present in the lives of our soldiers' *as they truly live them*.

the script is so corny that you can hear it from people while street walking
the directing  OK what's great about it  did you see the end of the movie and how the scenes connected together  oh yes this called lack of imagination
the performances is so annoying that it makes you question those actors resumes  especially Samuel L. Jackson
the homosexual **** is the weirdest thing i ever seen in a Hollywood movie  and that's not even the worst part  it doesn't add a thing to the story.

For the first forty minutes the woman just stares at prisoners as they are screamed at and tortured by the man.   After forty minutes the man disappears and the staring woman shares many far fetched ideas with her secret agent bosses about Usama Bin Laden.  The bosses don't believe the staring woman and won't let her have her way.  The staring woman screams at her bosses, insults them, and curses at them. A car bomb goes off outside a restaurant in which the staring woman is eating; the staring woman just stares.

A new lead in the hunt for Bin Laden develops.  The staring woman curses at her bosses and coworkers and insults them.  A CIA agent gets blown up.  The staring woman cries then cusses out her bosses and coworkers and insults them. Finally after what seems like an eternity Usama Bin Laden's house is discovered.   After thirty minutes of the staring woman generally being rude to everyone around her some soldiers show up and are told they are being sent a mission to kill someone who might be Bin Laden.

Like so many others in the movie the soldiers think the screaming woman is full of crap.  When they politely question her belief that Bin Laden has been found she, in a surprise twist, insults them.
After another eternity of the woman screaming and staring there's finally some decent action as the soldiers raid bin laden's compound and history is made.    After the raid the rude, arrogant, and apparently heartless main character, whom most of sane members of the audience stopped liking a long time ago, boards a C-130 and cries for some ambiguous reason and the film ends.

What’s her backstory? Why is she doing this? Would have been more involved if one of her family members died in the September 11th Attacks or something but the movie won’t go that far because they want to stick to true accounts. The only emotion we see from her other than the eagerness and get Bin Laden is her sadness when Al Qaeda bombed that CIA base that her partner was at and the tears that come out her eye after she confirmed that it was Bin Laden that was shot. It would be great if there was some interesting backstory. If there was a reason she was doing this that could be shown to make the audience like her more. If we take out the context of Al Qaeda and Bin Laden, and just look at the story of Maya fighting terrorists and catching a highly sought after terrorist leader, can her story stand on its own legs? Not to me, it can't.

Maya’s confidence is a big theme in this movie but the consequences of her being wrong is not addressed in a conflicting or dangerous manner.

Consequences: The possibility of Bin Laden not actually being in the Abbotobad compound was heavily addressed through the uncertainty of most of the characters beside Maya. However, the consequences were not explored! Because this movie is a true account, we know what is going to happen at the end. But why should we care if we are not sure of the consequences of what could happen? In Argo, we know they’re going to escape but there are some minor consequences we hear about: death by execution, foreigners getting caught in the airport, being hung in the streets. Even those consequences were weakly displayed. But what are the consequences if Bin Laden is not in the compound? Whose head will fall? What effect will it have on America? On the President? On Leon Panetta? On the continued activities of the CIA? Why aren’t people getting angry or playing politics on what could happen? Why is there no serious conflict here? What about other consequences? What if the Pakistani air force attacked them? What if the local police or militia did? Most importantly to the story of the movie, what happens to Maya if she is wrong?

Put Aside The Story of Maya: Did the film producers create the film because they had this unique story about a young, ambitious, female CIA agent who managed to deduce the location of a highly wanted and highly elusive criminal target? Or did they create the film because they wanted to show the steps taken to find and kill Osama Bin Laden? I think the film producers were “sold” on making the film based on the latter whether or not their interest began with the CIA agent story.

True Accounts: I read the basic Wikipedia summary on a handful of potential consequences and strategies surrounding the raid and these summary items went in so much more depth than the movie did. What if there was a bunker underneath the house? Why did they choose to do a raid instead of bombing? Or instead of a targeted drone strike? What was going on with Obama during this time? Just like in Argo, where we see nothing strategic and deep with Jimmy Carter, we see nothing interesting with President Obama, who is the final decision-maker in this whole process. We see no strategy in how the U.S. would know if the Pakistanis released the fighter jets because they have a deal with the Pakistanis that the jets given to them by the U.S. would be under 24-hour surveillance? What if Osama was wearing a suicide vest? How would they have handled it? What if there were mines on the doors? And these are just little wikipedia summary items that I skimmed. I expect a producer of a film to do highly extensive research and give me all the good stuff. There’s so much reasoning and strategy that is just dropped from this movie.

Other Ways To Tell The Story: Telling the story from the perspective of many people instead of the CIA agents would have given the movie a lot more depth. It would have been great to see what Obama, Panetta, the Admiral, and the CIA director were going through. How they didn’t want to be wrong. They could have told this story from many different perspectives and many different people. But they chose the story of Maya which is boring to me."

This agency gleefully provided torture coaching and assistance to Pinochet and the Argentinian Junta. It concocted false evidence and testimonies in the run up to both of the Gulf wars, and has been further destroying America's reputation worldwide for over a decade by torturing and murdering its way through the Middle East. And now it has somehow been allowed to make an undisputed, seemingly authoritative account of history in a way that both serves as PR for the CIA, but also makes a serious case to absolve the agency of its crimes by pointing to their utilitarian necessity.

Imagine a film about a serial killer, who in the early stages of his life, and indeed throughout his initial murders is trained, and assisted both in tactics and funding by the cops, the good guys who spend the rest of the film chasing the killer and finally capturing him. It would make you feel conflicted, and would raise questions about who the 'good' guys are, and just how 'good' they happen to be. Now consider how Zero Dark Thirty avoids the difficult task of confronting the reality. It relies on ostentatious badassery aimed at teenage boys who think the word  must be met with obligatory laughter. It strives to induce war-nerd boners among cargo-pant wearing gamers. And it reduces a contentious moment in U.S.history, the true events of which is kept under lock and key by an agency apparently incapable of acting morally or even legally, to your common or garden variety of detective fiction."

This film is informative in a breathless journalistic way and intermittently intriguing but its really just a contrived, arrogant, over-stuffed mish mash of left and right wing view points that ultimately is hugely dull.
The Hurt Locker, Bigelow's 2009 movie, came out during the Bush administration and probably began production around 2005. But it is a thrilling but personal antiwar movie. Recall the plot? The hero cannot bear to remain at ""home,"" the place he is protecting. There was a narrative and soul at the core of this film. you were able to invest your time to it. Zero Dark Thirty, as a piece of cinema, just totally misses the mark and leaves the viewer to decide its questions posed.
It seems to navigate deviously too. the torture scenes, though harsh are by no means controversial to the story, but they are shoved aside to then tell a tale of moral ambiguity and gung-ho American hero worship. The fact remains that the general public, no matter how clear they think they are with their opinion, will never know the truth. Yes there are misguided, fanatical jihads out there but there is too much corruption, greed and inconsistencies to label America the true heroes.

I understand that making a movie and showing reality are two different things... but i feel there is more fiction here than reality. From the (non) dynamic entry of the seal team into the compound, to the CIA analyst siccing her attack dogs to ""kill"" rather than capture he most valuable intelligence asset in the world at this time. Laughable really. But then again Hollywood has re-written lots of wartime history...remember all your friends who swore Inglorious Basterds was based on true events.

Jessica Chastain is one of the most annoying and terrible actors I've ever encountered, and her character is even worse- WHO CARES about some 'super woman' who single handly took down OBL.

A few good actors do pop in for a few seconds, but then go away and appear for no reason a hour later.
The ""best"" part of the movie, is the suicide bomber who was let into a get this... Tier 1 base because they said he'd get ""scared off"" of he got searched... LOL, the best part was she was texting a friend and you know from 500 miles away that when she died maya would send a few texts saying ""You there? Please respond if you get this""

Never, NEVER watch this movie. Maybe if you have no idea what happened with OBL , but if you're not american there is no point to watch this mound of ****

In that time, the movie had to be researched, the script drafted, the scenes shot, and the film edited.   In addition, much of the material the movie would have to rely on is undoubtedly still classified.  Given that, can anyone really believe that the film is at all accurate?  No way.  It would have been better to wait a few years for material to be declassified, let the historians write the books and shoot the documentaries, and then 10 to 15 years from now shoot a quality film based on accurate material.

Spielberg has made a name for himself in the film industry by reducing serious subjects to the lowest denominator until it's no more than any mawkish family melodrama. Why should a movie about the Holocaust be any different? Schindler's List is an aesthetic mess and exemplifies everything that's wrong about Hollywood.
First off, the movie's primary focus is to show us how Oscar Schindler, a slave owner aiming to run his factories through jew labour for monetary profit, turns into a defender of jews' rights and the protector of their lives. But the problem is Schindler's transformation is portrayed in an extremely poor way. In fact, there is no transformation. Midpoint in the film, the Schindler persona has disappeared, and we have a new character clothed in the same flesh -- a self-sacrificing philanthropist who spends his entire amassed fortune to save the Jew workers. How did we get from one to the other?
And then we have Amon Goeth. He's an evil, sadistic, Jew-hating **** - but do we get to know why he wakes up every morning, takes a swig of booze and snipes Jew prisoners for fun? No. Spielberg thinks the answer is obvious -- he's a ****, and **** don't have reasons for the things they do. The attempt to add depth to Göeth's character by dwelling on his twisted love affair with a Jewish girl is easily seen for what it is -- a cheap exposure of **** hypocrisy. The true intrigue, the true horror of the Holocaust does not lie in brutality alone, but rather in Hannah Arendt's ""banality of evil"". How can a man (or millions of men) arbitrarily narrow the moral sphere to exclude people seemingly no different from neighbours, friends and family?
Another problem is the accent. There are English-speaking films and then there are German-speaking films. Schindler's List, on the other hand, does not belong to either of these categories. One of the truly unforgivable aspects of the film is the ending. When Schindler took off his gold ring and blubbered ""I could have saved one more"", I experienced a feeling of mild revulsion. Spielberg's invariable resort to sentimentality is quintessentially Hollywood, quintessentially cheesy and quintessentially inappropriate for the subject matter of the film. Schindler's List is technically brilliant but Spielberg is a director of extremely limited vision. His moral and intellectual depth is that of a child (and the funny part is Schindler's List may be the most mature movie Spielberg has made till now)."

The bedrock of reality isn't thought. The bedrock of reality is being-in-the-world. It might sound like a strange or vague point to make about a movie but this movie exemplifies it in the worst way. I can't sum up this trilogy any better than to say it's tagline could be 'I Think, Therefore I am'. To see how this phrase might not be the ultimate truth look at how being really is.
Being-in-the-world is gravity, repetition, and energy holding us in an orbit (think of the sun, the source of life). These three things make thought possible. Gravity can be love, caring, attraction, repulsion. Repetition can be cycles, seasons, habits, the basis of truth, waves. And energy can be any kind of energy.
As for the scene at the table, a computer can play chess because chess is math and the language of math is fixed. A computer can't use language like us because language is affixed to being-in-the-world. Computers don't have being-in-the-world. Computers only have energy and repetition.

From other reviews, I was expecting a decent portrayal of Turner's artistic life, quirks, passions and lots of landscape colors.  I got those, but not in a very cohesive manner.  Instead, you got a poor script that had no flow or continuity- kept jumping around and you were trying to make sense of a scene as to what it was saying and why it was there and then you were somewhere else in an instant.  As for Turner's character, you needn't have thought it was an international film- if you like scowling, grunting and growling, they are universal in any language.  When Turner wasn't doing the foregoing, he talked like he had marbles in his mouth.  I usually don't have problems understanding British dialect having lived over there for a long time, but I had problems with getting the lines in this film- mostly because he never opened his mouth except to pout.  I can understand a generally grumpy personality, but this portrayal kept pulling me out of the realm of credibility- here sits Mrs. Booth (his pseudo-wife at the end of his life), smiling brightly like the sun in the sky, smiling coquettishly at a squinty-eyed Scrooge- we're really supposed to believe that anyone could be attracted to such a man as portrayed?  Bah Humbug!  (I kept expecting him to say it at any moment.)

The film hardly relates to his painting process or what it meant and felt to him at all, in fact it gives the impression that his art was just something he did as an occupation and something wholly inconsequential.  Instead it focused entirely on every bit of negativity of his life and character, spiced with a couple of well known incidents handled in a halfhearted manner in an effort at convincing us that this is still the man we came to see. The non-existing story line rambles on at the later part of his life and is more a socio-cultural portrait of the environment he lived in, filled with sickly, ugly pathological men and women, living in stuffy repressed times, stumbling on to their shabby graves. The film does not touch upon his childhood or background, his growth and passion for art, the technicalities and extraordinary development of his work, and the undoubtedly ecstatic states he must have derived from the fulfilling moments of his efforts. Absolutely nothing to show us and touch us about what drove and inspired the  man. Nothing about the flight, the journey, the adventure. Given that he was such a profound artist and his visual understanding was a century before his time, it is  mind boggling that everything that truly matters about him has been sidelined and that instead we are served a mean and  mediocre  extract of the least interesting little parts of this genius's life and personality.

For sheep who want to belong to the hip crowd and the artsy fartsy folks with below average IQ. Clearly the reviewers were all paid off or cherry picked (Sony is notorious for fixing reviews), because they cant get average real people to positively review their garbage. Extremely boring film with nonsensical plot, uninteresting characters that have no depth whatsoever on top of extremely stupid looking martial arts like we were back in the early 80s again (but without the grit). No redeeming qualities anywhere. This one was so bad I actually walked out of the movie theater on its premiere more than a decade ago. I asked and was given a refund. I watched it entirely a few days ago and basically played with my phone the second half of the movie out of boredom. For what its worth, I like action movies but I don't need explosions and effects to find enjoyment. I need a story 1st, and then anything else is gravy... it a movie after all. If i want to look at a painting ill go do that but this is a movie and not a painting. A movie is supposed to have a story to tell otherwise there is no reason to make it into a movie aside from appeasing one inflated ego. Even if a story is non-sense it could still be interesting if characters are interesting or funny. This movie has none of that. It might as well had been told in a 10 page picture book for kids.

First and foremost, the folk music era (which was during high school for us) was very short **** a good reason.  Rap music has been around longer. And frankly, I thought the original music and screenplay from A Mighty Wind, a spoof on this era, was far superior.  At the end, I thought I had watched a French film; it was just made by Americans.  You know the kind.  People you never really can connect with don't say much and nothing ever happens and there is an ending that is purposefully enigmatic.  All in all nothing happened to anybody.  This guy was very hard to like; he's a loser who's only shred of accountability is trying to care for his friend's cat.  I also didn't like the shrewish ex girlfriend or whatever she was to him.  HIs deceased partner in music...what was that all about?  The trip from NY to Chicago and back in the wind and snow was for what purpose?  I guess to allow John Goodman a chance to give a brief  quirky inexplicable cameo.  What did it show us about Llewyn except more of what a pathetic boring loser this guy is.  Good grief!  And the music definitely evoked all the memories of how puerile most folk music was.  If you want to watch a meaningful comment on that brief period, don't miss A Mighty Wind.

All the songs (with the exception of the one performed by Justin Timberlake in the Columbia Records studio) are the same monotonous tempo as if all the metronomes in the world were set at 15 beats per minute.  Could we have seen any other facial expression on the guy except for the permanent look of pain and suffering?  I was in the Village during the Beatnik era and remember it so differently.  Did the Coen Brothers talk to anyone who was there?   Dave Van Ronk's book about his life and times was allegedly an inspiration, but did they actually read it?  This did not approximate the Mayor of MacDougal Street energy and spirit, but rather the drab life of an Accountant of MacDougal Street. A huge disappointment after hearing all the hype.

Words like small, painful, heavy, melancholy, bleak, deeply felt and exquisitely crafted.  Few, if any, of them describe this movie as clever, interesting or entertaining.  That’s because it isn’t.
Here’s more of what this movie isn’t. It isn’t funny. The night I saw this movie, the theater was sold out.  No one laughed, not even once. Also, the songs aren’t that great. Unlike O’ Brother, Where Art Thou?, you’re not going to be singing any of these songs to yourself as you walk out the door, and you’re not likely to hear them on the radio, or anywhere else, ever again.  (Sorry T-Bone.)   Worst of all, the story isn’t very interesting or entertaining.  It’s about a folk singer struggling to make it as a musician.  He takes himself very seriously, and he thinks he’s better than everyone else.   He makes a lot of bad decisions and pretty much alienates everyone around him.  It turns out he’s not that good a song writer, and he gets beat up for being a jerk.  Then the movie ends.  (No one applauded.  Everyone was too busy scratching their head and saying “Huh?”)  No Country for Old Men was something of a head scratcher too, but at least it was interesting.

912,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/inside-llewyn-davis/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,folkchick,"Dec 25, 2013",1,"This film was supposedly ""inspired"" by the hilarious book ""The Mayor Of MacDougal Street"" by Dave Van Ronk, the larger-than-life Greenwich Village folk legend.  Somehow, against all odds, the Coen Bros managed to create a dull, plodding, joyless, pointless film. The only good that can come from this movie is the spotlight shining on the late great Dave Van Ronk and re-introducing his work to the world.

If you go see this film keep in mind that that Coens got everything wrong  the folk scene was energetic, fun, lively, bursting with life, and the best of the singer/songwriters were very supportive of each other.  It was Dave Van Ronk who first said: ""Never root against your competitor if what they are doing is good music.  When music of quality sells it's good for all of us.""  He also said, ""Honesty can be the cruelest game of all.  Not only can someone hurt you  and hurt you to the bone  they can feel self righteous about it at the same time."" And this:  ""Never make the mistake of thinking someone you don't like, likes you."" (You have to think about that for a second).

You'd never imagine anything like that coming out of the mouth of Llewyn Davis.

You can probably guess that I knew Van Ronk, and like many of my compatriots, am baffled how such a bleak film sprang from such brilliantly witty source material.  They should have thought twice about using Dave Van Ronk's name to give this film a sort of street cred.  There's too many of us out here who see how false this film rings, and because of our love and reverence for the man, feel compelled to speak up on his behalf."

the script was corny  the screen play was silly  the characters were stupid and the directing was normal and there isn't a music and a moral afterward.
some how the producer/directer was able be lazy in terms of  screen play and people weren't able to recognize that  but if you do  you will notice that there isn't a dialog which might be the laziest way to produce a movie with only few good scene and a huge gap between them.

As it is based on a fictional work (book) there seems to be no logical sence for brutal violence then for pure entertainment. I don't find brutal and senseless violence entertaining. I do not find it artistic or enriching or in any way psychologically interesting.
The movie did not have the riveting plot or entertainment value of Silence of the Lambs or Pulp Fiction. It did not have strong characters such as Tommy Lee Jones in the Fugative whith it's suspence. There was no witty dialogue or great music.
In my opinion the movie lacked everything in quality. The ending was a total letdown as if someone who was working on the ending just  handed it in unfinished and left.
72 people were murdered in Mexico last week - do people find that entertaining? I understand that art is up to interpretation but just as there are great works of art there are really poor ones. A broken lightbulb on a wet floor at the Guggenheim that is exhibited for a month draws reaction and it is weak - just because something is new and has not been done before does not mean that it is great art and good.  Awarding this piece of dung with an academy award takes away from all the great productions which have been awarded in the past and cheats the public into thinking that any junk, no matter how bad it is will be great and worth enduring and spending your money on just because it was awarded and got great reviews. This movie is one of the worst ever and a disgrace to have been awarded. Javier Bardem Bardem is a good actor in many things - not an   academy award winner in this one. The Coen brothers should pay me back for my time wasted watching their junk but I will know better in the future. I am watching every  Best Picture Academy Award winner and about 60% of the way through, this is by far the worst movie.

A fearless look at a group of people alive today and their inner most thoughts about a dark time in Indonesian history. The kicker? These people are monsters and director Joshua Oppenheimer is unfortunately giving them a voice. The film follows Oppenheimer as he interviews a group of Indonesian death squad executioners responsible for the mass communist genocide that took place in 1965, a horrific period in Indonesian history carried out by these so called subjects. The film is crass and lacks any kind of remorse as it ridicules the children of those who died, shows the wonderful lives that these killers now have and glorifies an action that took over a million lives. The Act of Killing is a disgraceful picture designed to disturb as to inspire action. However Oppenheimer must know the futility of his struggle and the inevitability  of his failure so his creation of this rubbish only serves to entertain his interviewees. Not only does the film give them a pulpit to shout out their propaganda but it also treats it all as alright, a necessary evil. The Act of Killing breaks the cardinal rule of documentary film making, it doesn't have anything in it worth telling the rest of the world, it doesn't have a purpose beyond mocking the dead."

That these people, guilty of such atrocious crimes, are still walking around freely, without conscience and living in relative opulence is absolutely abhorrent to me. I understand that the point of documentary film making is to uncover truths and depict life as it is. I also recognise that my strong reaction against the film (or at least the content) is precisely the point, but the casual re-enactments of the crimes seems wrong to me. One character actually states that he would like to be famous. Well, whether for the right or wrong reasons this film certainly gives him his time in the sun.

Disregard for life is also demonstrated with animals when the lead protagonist shows the crew around his stuffed collection proclaiming nonchalantly that he had personally killed the black Rhino, whilst dismissively pointing out that the species was near extinction.

Content aside, the print under review is the director's cut which at 159 minutes is excessively long and when not shocking has extremely boring interludes, with some edits appearing just chaotic. The last 20 minutes or so when Anwar Cong, one of the killers, shows remorse by crying and later gagging (as if to vomit) is just an insult to all his victims as well as being extremely distasteful.

I am aware of all the superlatives that the documentary has been receiving, both written and oral, and it must be said that the audience that I viewed the film with stayed in their seats well into the end credits and left very subdued, but I did approach the film reluctantly and with caution.

The use of John Barry's beautiful song 'Born Free' emphasises the ugliness of everything else going on, I don't dispute that it is powerful film making, but I also can't dispute that I hated it!"

This movie should never have been nominated for an Oscar. It is just one Russian stereotypical problem after another. It has the feel of a propaganda film. Yea, all Russian police, court, government officials are corrupt while common people sit around drinking vodka and cheat on their spouses. At the end of the film, a priest gives a sermon about seeing the truth and getting rid of lies. HA, maybe the director of this film should take some of this priest's advice because the whole film does not accurately portray Russians. This film is a real Khaltura (hack job).

Always the attack on anything, no matter how remote, associated with Jesus, Iesus, Christianity, etc.

And in this movie, viewed at no cost to me, and I truly hope it loses money for the producer, portrays a Christian leader of the church giving advice that is patently, totally, utterly wrong.

In other words, the director dresses up a devil worshiper in an Orthodox priest frock and gives him a few lines that are not at all consistent with the character portrayed.

Given the exact same set of circumstances, I am confident you could not find a single Christian priest (or whatever they call them) over there that would have given the same advice, which in this case was to overrule the corrupt mayor's rare **** of conscience, to tell him to take matters into his own hands, and to forcefully do whatever was necessary to rid himself of his antagonist, instead of what a real Christian would do, and that is to advise the mayor to pursue the truth and justice, the cornerstones of what Jesus stood for.

And let's not also forget that Jesus got in the face of the ""synagogue of Satan"", run by the Pharisee mafia of Jesus' day. Those were the people who forced the hand of Pilot. They were the ones chanting ""Crucify him! Crucify him! Crucify him!""

The sting of his resurrection, and his ubiquitous presence in the world is obviously a real burn for the synagogue of Satan, because, as we see, Hollywood, and now even Russian movie makers, will never pass up the chance to demonize Iesus (using the older spelling) and his followers, when they are the demons themselves.

While it is true corruption finds its way into the heart of every man, woman and child at one point or the other, yes, even a Christian leader, but it would also be a Jewish leader as well. Yet, in this movie, once again, we see a conspicuously over the top misrepresentation of a follower of Iesus, which leads the intelligent viewer, who isn't an empty brain waiting to be washed, to suspect all the other things the director is attempting to represent are also exaggerated.

Lastly, the timing is conspicuous, as the notoriously anti-Christian Beast of the west is attacking the Russian people's economy because they don't like Putin, a man who has the audacity to show up in church on Easter Sunday to pay tribute to the risen Lord.

Hmmph ... a bunch of little babies with too much (counterfeit) money and time on their hands.

973,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toy-story-3/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,carlminez,"Jun 2, 2011",0,"can't escape the feeling that Toy Story 3 is being terribly overrated by critics and moviegoers alike. Critics are calling it ""heartbreaking"" and ""inspiring"", and a movie critic from NYT even went as far as calling it ""a deep, complex take on mortality"". Seriously? Personally, I found Toy Story 3 of being a surprisingly formulaic and unappealing movie of the following reasons. Firstly, the same story formula is being recycled for the third time! Just like in the other two movies, the toys are separated from Andy. Overall, the plot just feels like one big excuse to move the characters from the backdrop of Andy's room to the daycare center where the story is being transformed into a prison break parody, filled with plot-twists, slapstick humor and gay-jokes, directly aimed at the adults in the audience. But the worst thing is that this movie isn't treating the characters with respect. Rather than having them develop beyond the minimal standard required for the plot, the directors focused more on having them do stupid things and end up in stupid situations. There are about a dozen different toys in the series now, most of which only functions as comic relief characters that stick around in the background. The majority of these toys spend more times being chewed on by drooling babies than showing any character development, whatsoever. Buzz and Woody are really the only ones worth mentioning, which is sad, because both Woody and Buzz are terribly simplistic in this third installment. Woody is the same few-worded, whiny character he was in the other two movies. But it's okay. He doesn't change because the plot requires him to stay the same. But Woody was never the star of this series. It was the space ranger, Buzz, who stole the show back in 1995. In Toy Story 3, the ugly doll is reduced to pure, stupid and brain-dead entertainment. The only character development Buzz Lightyear demonstrates isn't more complex than the switching on the button in his back. He spends the majority of the movie in ""demo-mode"", delivering catchphrases and references to his delusional space-persona. And it's funny about the first time he does it and not quite as funny about the tenth time. And he spends the rest of the movie as a surprisingly distasteful and offensive Spanish stereotype. And really, oh so devoted Pixarfans, doesn't the fact that the directors would take Buzz Lightyear and change him so carelessly in the film speak volumes of their indifference to their own characters' personalities? I just can't figure out what, if anything, makes this movie so good. From my point of view, It is terrible! And it becomes even more staggering when you think about how other animated movies, personal favorites that are by far more sophisticated and complex; Like How to Train Your Dragon and Bolt, are being pushed in the background to make way for the unyielding glorification of Pixar. Okay, both of these movies have been met fairly well by critics, particularly Dragon, but none of them have received the attention Toy Story 3 received, despite being more deserving. My personal favorite, Bolt, was very underrated, almost overlooked, when realized back in 2008."

The director named Scorsese has gone on to make many movies including Casino which may follow on from Goodfellas but that may be highly controversial and I may be wrong. Casino has some of the same actors like De Niro and Pesci and the same director so it's similar to Goodfellas and so how it was made too. ..... The main actor in Goodfellas is a guy named quite politely Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta, other characters are Jimmy Conway played by Robert De Niro and whatever Pesci's character was called, Tommy I think. The film revolves mainly around violence and family issues aswell as a few gangster scenes, a scene where an old friend insults Tommy (Joe Pesci) at a bar, says sorry and Tommy comes back later and with his friend Jimmy Conway (De Niro) beats the **** out of him on the floor after he insulted Tommy to the point where he's a bloody mess then dump him in the boot of a car then later stab him is genuinely one of the best scenes in this movie. There are many well made violent scenes but there's a few problems with Goodfellas and one is Lorraine Bracco who plays Henry Hill's wife because all she does is moan, cry, whinge, shout, yell and be absolutely annoying and you just want to knock her out. The other problem is that Goodfellas centres too much around family involvement and family issues which makes the film more boring than is necessary for a 18 rated violent movie, some of the characters are silly and even unlikeable. I thought drug use in the movie was a good idea but being mainly centred around family and family issues weakened it for me and having kids and babies star in an adult, graphic violent movie shot the director in the leg on this masterpiece. It just didn't work and Lorraine Bracco is unlikeable as Henry Hill's wife and even Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is a bit dull or over the top at times. Joe Pesci was excellent in Goodfellas, Robert De Niro could of been much better but the violent scenes were good with plenty of blood. However mostly I found Goodfellas to be boring, bit too long with annoying Lorraine Bracco in it which is just absolute torture to sit through and experience and that annoying kid at the beginning of the movie who played a young Henry Hill putting petrol or gasoline over cars and setting them alight so all the cars explode into a ball of fire then running away was totally unnecessary. Mostly a bland, dull, boring movie with some annoying characters, some good characters, some horrible songs played throughout the film, some good violent scenes but nothing special and a bit gloomy.... Could of been much better a film."

One  thing about it was the continued urge of the days directors to have ""homages' to other movies and directors, a nitwit idea started in the 60s.

Our protagonists are a naive stuck-up girl right out of college and an equally stuck-up cynical actor. Neither show any real interest in Japanese culture (he's even quite disrespectful) and neither makes any really attempt to connect with the Japanese (even though they both get the chance to connect). Even though she seems to have a degree in philosophy and he seems to be somewhat of an intellectual type, their interactions remain mostly superficial. And still, their interaction with one another is pretty much everything we get to see for this entire film. I guess this film appeals to people just as pretentious and shallow as the main protagonist (which is the only reason I can think of to explain its popularity), but I personally found it hard to connect with either of them AT ALL.

Further, I wonder how much sense it makes for their relationship to have remained purely platonic. Both seem to be estranged from their respective spouses, his wife is on the other side of the ocean, her husband is on a photo shoot for several days, both act like they haven't had sex in a long time, she's a beautiful impressionable young girl, he's a famous actor, they both don't shun alcohol and at one point they become close enough to lie together on a bed while he touches her feet. Maybe it's just me, but I personally find it hard to believe they didn't end up having sex together considering the aforementioned conditions. Anyway, the shame and confusion arising from such a situation (after both realise they made a mistake cheating their respective spouse) would at least have made a far more interesting film to watch Maybe this film appeals to people who never spent more than a few days in a foreign country, but having spent about 3 months in Poland I couldn't see anything I haven't experienced myself AT A FAR GREATER INTENSITY. For me, this makes ""Lost In Translation"" as exciting to watch as two people sitting at a bus stop waiting for the bus to arrive. Actually the latter would probably be more interesting, because the bus doesn't take THAT long to arrive."

Features Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson in Tokyo for separate reasons. Japan and the Japanese are portrayed in a poor (and stereotyping) fashion, (video games, karaoke, gadgets, and the misprounciations of ""Ls"" as ""Rs"").

There is borderline racism in this movie, as the way these two lead roles act, as if lost, estranged, abandoned, or stranded on the moon surrounded by Aliens. I've been to Japan (I'm a western European) and found no such culture shock. That is really the premise that this movie is built on - culture shock of White Western people finding themselves in Japan. And that is where it fell down for me. In terms of comedy, it was billed as ""Bill Murray - comedy genius - at his best."" Far from it. I like Murray (Quick Change, Stripes, Caddyshack, etc.) This was just not funny, and I do not think there is any attempt for him to be funny.

I do think not only is it the worst fantasy movie I have ever seen, honestly Legend and Princess Bride were much better, but one of the worst movies ever made.

The dialogue was inane and vomit inducing. In one part of the movie Snails says something along the lines of ""That is the riddlyiest thing I have ever heard"". Not only was that unfunny, but entirely out of place. The direction was off too, and the scenery was okay, but the camera-work was so flat and unfocused, it was barely a redeeming quality. And the plot was poor too, likewise with the special effects and you could drive a big tube train in some of the holes in the action.

And the acting was atrocious. Jeremy Irons is a great actor, participating in fantastic films like Lion King and Reversal of Fortune. But as the villain in possibly the worst performance of his career, not helped by the terrible dialogue he was given, he chews the scenery to pieces, honestly the dreadful overacting puts someone like Tim Curry to shame. Marlon Wayans was cringe worthy, his humour was lame and in some cases unnecessary, and Justin Whalin; bland beyond bland. Unbearably wooden at times, and as the hero? Tom Cruise did better in Legend and he was the main flaw of that movie. Just for the record, I do think Legend has its flaws, but it is gorgeous to look at, and Tim Curry's Darkness was phenomenal, and should've got an award. Thora Birch acquits herself better, but her dialogue was poor, and I was thinking, is she a little too young for the part?

Overall, terrible. You may like it, and I have no problem if you do, but as a die hard fantasy fan, I hated it. Watch Legend, Princess Bride or NeverEnding Story instead. 1/10 Bethany Cox"

1003,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/freddy-got-fingered/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,BillyGaming420,"Apr 30, 2025",1,"Freddy Got Fingered is a 2001 surreal black comedy film directed by Tom Green in his feature film directorial debut and written by him and Derek Harvie. The film stars Green alongside Rip Torn, Marisa Coughlan, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Harland Williams and Julie Hagerty.

Green stars in the film as a childish slacker who wishes to become a professional cartoonist while dealing with his abusive father's behavior. Its plot resembles Green's struggles as a young man trying to get his television series picked up, which would later become the MTV series The Tom Green Show. The title of the film refers to a plot point where Green's character falsely accuses his father of sexually abusing his brother, the eponymous Freddy.

Released in theaters on April 20, 2001, by 20th Century Fox, Freddy Got Fingered was critically panned at the time of its release, with many considering it as one of the worst films of all time. It was also a box office disappointment, grossing $14.3 million worldwide, slightly above its $14 million budget. It received five Golden Raspberry Awards of its eight nominations, as well as a Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association Award for Worst Picture. However, the film quickly developed a cult following after its release on home video and has earned some positive critical re-evaluation."

A friend (at the time) told me it was a work of utter genius, once you understood its logic. So, I sat on the edge of the couch, devoting 100% of my mental faculties to unpacking its inner brilliance. There were jokes about pedophilia, dead moose, sausages. There were scenes that seemed like they were intended to be comedy, or at least that was my intuition, except for the fact that none of them were funny. Brutal un-funniness notwithstanding, what was the intention of the film makers - ie how did they think the audience would interpret this as 'humour', given that it lacked any and all required elements?
Anyway, i cut all ties with the friend who recommended this film, have given up on trying to integrate its puerile non-logic into my existing worldview, and have gotten on with my life again.
You know those films where you imagine how it was financed? This  is THE perfect example - imagine Tom Green  sitting across from a bunch of film execs, mumbling about moose and pedophilia, possibly with his genitals laid out on the table (CUZ ITS FUNNY HA HA) and them just cutting him a bumper check with which to devolve the entire field of cinema.

It is based on the superb and entertaining British TV series from the 1961-1969 with a revival from 1976-77. Adaptation wise this is in the top position for the worst adaptations of source material and comparable with The last Airbender. Both are slightly more than an in name only adaptation and the hearth, soul and humour from the original is gone. Also it is usually high ranked in worst of all time movie lists. It is simply poorly written, the story is unimpressive, the characters fail to entertain or are hilarious out of place. I want to mention that fans and non fans of the original are on a common ground here. They fail to grasp the concept of the series and entertaining movies. The show and characters deserved a better adaptation. John Steed is up there in style, intelligence and capability with the best agents in fiction (has also great humour). Emma Peel was an icon. A strong, capable and independent women (not seen often at the time). It was nominated for nearly all worst awards and won two (unfair for me because it earned more;-). I will stop bashing here and will say you should watch the TV series instead. The seasons with John Steed and Emma Peel are regarded as best. Remark: The tone from the first season is different. Also John Steeds companions change from time to time. There are (later) some fantasy or science fiction elements in some episodes and other take a more grounded approach. The mixture of action, good stories, humour and characters made this show great."

The story feels half-done as almost nothing is explained in its plot--and not in a mysterious way that lets the viewer create their own conclusions but in a way that leads me to believe the screenwriter just gave up because ""writing is hard.""  The only saving grace is the fact that Clancy Brown is in it and he does a tremendous job with the little screen time he gets.  A young actor by the name of Carter Cabassa also does quite well in the film but isn't allowed to shine until the movie is almost over.

The vast majority of the blame for that falls on Vic Armstrong. Not saying the man didn't have his work cut out for him due to a questionable script and low budget, but his terrible direction is what really kills the movie.

Whether it's inspiring career worst performances from a cast of usually competent actors or awkwardly fumbling through scenes to the point of sometimes unintentional hilarity, Armstrong is just never able to make the story work for him. Everything feels so unnatural and forced. Trash cinema enthusiasts will likely get a kick out of the downright bizarre exchanges characters have with one another. Although the generic, made-for-TV drama style the movie is shot in makes it a total snoozefest even when the explosions and aircraft trouble take center stage.

That's Armstrong's biggest failing. He simply couldn't make any of this even remotely interesting. That overly long 1h 51m running time drags by like a one-legged dog. Did I mention this is supposed to be faith-based? I almost forgot because the actual references to God are so few. In a self-defeating move the writers even failed at their attempt to scare people to the altar with an inept, ""wait for the sequel"" ending that leaves everything unresolved. So in the end this a movie that's more likely to have you sleeping through the rapture rather than dropping to your knees in repentance.

I think the actors did the best they could with the material they had. They were better than your standard Saturday-night Syfy movie overall anyway. The plot was terrible (worse than both the book and the original film in my opinion), the lighting was bad, and the pacing was, well, bad. The whole movie was, in a word, boring. In a way, it sort of had an identity crisis. I understood that with this reboot they wanted to reach beyond the mainline American Christian audience, so you could see elements of disaster or even sci-fi genres, but in the end, it could only pull off a quasi-Christian film feel, albeit it with more mainstream actors.

There's so much else I could say, but the bottom line is that you could only like this movie if you're Jenkins' and LaHaye's biggest fans and/or have no critical expectations of films.

When I saw the trailers I was a little apprehensive in that Hollywood has a way of butchering some of the best books and making them into movie disasters but this one takes the cake. This book is suppose to be about the apocalypse. How did it get to be about Nicholas Cage piloting a plane and the peoples reactions  and about Cassi Thompson saving the plane and just a little about the rapture. Firstly Cassi Thompson as Chloe Steele was grossly misrepresented and Nicholas Cage as Rayford Steele was laughable the state of shock he was in for the entire movie was hilarious. My advice for anyone watching this movie, read the books you'll enjoy them more. Movie was poorly made, poorly taught out, should have stuck to the book it would have made the movie Epic!. So disappointed, always wanted this book series to be made into a movie and then This Happens. Will not recommend this to anyone. SMH."

If the film seems unreal to you as it begins, join the club. As a Christian who not only has written a book about this particular Biblical prophecy, but is preparing to publish a second, more extensive work on the subject, it is a privilege to review a Hollywood production that actually deals with unfamiliar reality.

""Left Behind"" grapples with a prediction coming in the near future from a Book that has never missed on any prophecy it has ever proclaimed.

As Cage's character says in one scene, ""This is not about you or me.""

Based on the blockbuster books of Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, and the films that followed suit, ""Left Behind,"" is more compelling than when the initial impact hit from the first book in the series entitled ""Left Behind.""

What seems like eons back in our movie-saturated lives, was in fact only a couple decades or so. But then, who keeps track anymore, anyway? Only historians, and who listens to them?

For life is truly 'swifter than a weaver's shuttle,' as intoned by Job nearly four millenia ago.

That the public reception does not resemble Hollywood gi-taculars, Jesus was not elected the Mayor of Jerusalem. His Word, as His Book, only skyrocketed after He came out of the grave, being seen alive by a crowd of over 500 eye-witnesses at once on one documented occasion.

Cage was asked why he was doing this film in one interview before the release of the picture. He replied, ""Because I never thought about this before.""

This film won't convince you to believe in Jesus. In fact you're going to have to listen and watch very close to even find a Bible thread in the story.

But while you're eating dinner at your local dine-in theatre, watching the story unfold, you are going to think about it too. This story isn't based on truth, it is based on The Truth.

It is not an exaggeration to say nothing in this movie is funny. Maybe it is the terrible pacing caused the nonsensical scenes covered by forced dialogue.

Cardboard is more exciting than the action and the humor is either in your face or already drawn out. This movie introduces some cool things, but nothing that furthers the plot or has not been done before. Plus anything responsible for hurting Eddie Murphy's career can't be good. The worst part about this film is that there are no real adventures. It is called ""The Adventures of  Pluto Nash"", yet it is as adventurous as buying milk from the groceries. The film tries to be a neo-noir mystery, but in actuality it is as boring as predictable as the film just mimics rather than innovates.

Then there is the story and acting. While the former movie got the right balance of seriousness and taking itself not too serious, this movie fails. There are a lot of scenes / stuff that should be engaging. But it is pointless, an under-performance or unintentionally hilarious. I don't blame the actors. Even the best actors /actress cant get much out of an awful script or a bad role. What troubles me the most are the sparks of good ideas in this movie. With adaptations and improvements you could make a better or even good movie out of the setting and some ideas. Then there are the fights. While I admit that the final confrontation is engaging the total performance is disappointing. It is sadly not even “So bad that it is good”. That would at least improve the rating.

Repulsive and sleazy writing is the replacement of what could of have been an intriguing screw-ball comedy. Every unfunny joke will make the film feel like it is going slower and slower. The characters were not acted very well and were created to be more like gimmicks than actual human beings. Not to mention that the characters are not relatable or likeable at all. The last thing you want as filmmaker is make something hard to sit through, unless that is your goal. If that is your case then Whipped is the perfect blueprint on how to achieve that. Nothing feels natural or realistic about how people act or interact with people in this movie, which makes it hard for the viewer to delve into the lore of what is happening. The film is also very grounded, which kills the possibility of over-the-top fun. Some people can tell you it's funny, but they are probably not able to explain why. The humor in this film is very acquired and 99% of the audience will probably prefer to actually be whipped then watch this."

To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.

Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' is a prime example of this, a film with very little to recommend and just very poorly done in many areas.

Starting with the very few good things, Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasance, in his last film before his death from heart failure not long after (although his screen time is far too short and was clearly severely truncated), come off in a good way in the acting department.

The exploding head death is a pretty fun one and the setting is eerie. As far as praises go, that is it.

'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' was directed by someone who had an apparent dislike for Pleasance, the main reason for his limited screen time most likely, and had no interest in directing the film or the 'Halloween' series in general, and it shows loud and clear on screen. Even the direction in 'Season of the Witch' and 'Halloween 5' wasn't this indifferent or inept.

Sadly the effectiveness of the setting, which actually is eerie, is hindered by the filming and editing being pretty amateurish, the photography often is far too dark and drab and the editing makes bacon-slicer-like editing seem coherent in comparison. The music, like the previous film, is here a drawback when it was one of the better elements of the first four films. Here it sounds cheap, goofy and would have sounded out of date even in the 80s most likely.

Everything looks, sounds and feels like it was made in a rush and with absolutely no heart, accounting for the constant sense of incompleteness. There is nothing scary or suspenseful, it's unintentionally campy, uncomfortably strange and by the numbers with a convoluted story that makes no sense whatsoever, an abrupt ending, dull pacing and the man in black/cult plot that is just bizarre and just muddles everything. Michael Myers is just not creepy enough and looks goofy.

Very like the previous sequel, there is nothing interesting or endearing about the characters (though none are quite as annoying as Tina in 'Halloween 5'). The script especially sounds incomplete and the acting, apart from Rudd and Pleasance (whose screen time, as said, is far too short), is subpar to put it lightly. J.C. Brandy is a pretty poor replacement for Danielle Harris.

Overall, don't expect any terror, scares, fear or thrills here, you'll be disappointed. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

Ce 6ème a quand même pour but de faire relever le niveau, j'ai quand même envie de vomir quand je dis ça.. mais quand vous voyez un Halloween ayant comme titre ""La malédiction de Michael Myers"", tu t'attend pas à un culte du cinéma de l'horreur et à un succès. J'ai l'impression que les producteurs insistent beaucoup sur le fait que c'est essentiel de rallonger cette pauvre franchise juste pour la faire souffrir encore plus et la faire tomber à l'agonie. Voilà c'est très nanardesque comme titre, surtout que ça a été recherché par le pauvre Joe Chapelle, réalisateur incompétent nous faisant exhiber sa Filmographe bien médiocre.

En faite Halloween 6, ça n'apporte rien oui.. mais si ça a pour but de faire kiffer les amateurs de gore et de continuer dans une linéarité scénaristique faible et à la fois complètement banale. Je me dit qu'on devrait s'en passer et en arrêter là, et attendre 40 ans après pour recevoir l'excellent Halloween 2018, comme ça on garderait que les 3 premiers épisodes, oui j'ai cité Halloween III parce que je l'adore, je suis complètement fan ! et garder ceux de Rob Zombie ^^ Surtout qu'en plus il essaye de rajouter une histoire un peu plus complexe, plus recherché afin de bien faire remplir son contenu et donner un nouveau chemin à la saga, mais si ça devait être original, hum.. c'est raté parce que ça ne sert toujours à rien.. et pk a t-il 6.6/10 sur Metacritic ?

The film is so bad, I will not ever rent or buy a bad box office flop again.

The list could go on, though there is a lot more to get to. The plot is mostly cliched, contrived nonsense; the characters look stupid, do stupid things and say stupid things; but where Battlefield Earth fails on such an IMMENSE scale is the direction. Seriously, the direction is ABHORRENT - never has a big-budget Hollywood movie been directed so awfully. The camera is almost permanently stuck on an absurd diagonal, making it very hard to concentrate, and also causing borderline motion sickness. On top of that, the colours and the lighting are so ugly that it almost defies you to continue watching. Every scene is either in this dull and lifeless blue, or a bewildering menagerie of green, yellow and purple. It's just baffling how anyone could look at this steaming pile and find it anything but excruciating! In addition to this abomination of direction is a cast of grossly unappealing actors, including the emotional flatline, Barry Pepper; the half-asleep Forest Whitaker; and of course, the ham and cheese deluxe, John Travolta. All the adjectives in the world fail to even touch on the complete depth of hopelessness that Battlefield Earth exudes in all facets of production. Let it be the saga of the year 2000, so that all will know of the first mistake humankind made in the new millennium."

One can see that this film lives in the shadows of Saw as one of the weaker torture porn entries. Like Saw it has the huge problem of terrible editing. Sometimes it feels like the film is buffering, but in actuality it is the atrocious fades and cuts. The film also has your lack luster jump scares and sound cues so it can hit its quota with horror tropes. The biggest issue this film has is that it does not have an ending. Maybe it does; the last 15 minutes were so bad it was hard to tell. Regardless, this movie has so many plot holes in it, therefore, you end up with a very empty movie. It is like watching grass grow, you watch as nothing really changes and nothing affects you.

1274,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-tortured-1969/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,MovieGuys,"Feb 3, 2014",0,"For a movie called ""The Tortured"", I feel pretty tortured from watching it. I would've given it negative stars if it was possible.

This wannabe horror-movie thriller is badly acted, coarsely edited, the audio is unsynchronized, the list goes on and on. Oh, and of course it's disgustingly graphic, which can be justified and work in some movies (i.e. Se7en), but it was just unbearable and gross in this movie.

To start off, this movie's plot just screams cliché. In fact, a good way to describe this movie is just one big horror movie cliché. The horrible plot is this: A psychotic man kidnaps a couple's son while the dad is distracted and the wife is at work. The police can't find ****, and of course the mom, being emotionally vulnerable as she should be, blames the cops for not finding her son. Screw logic! I mean seriously, investigations take a long time, and if the killer left no clues or evidence, then it will be harder. But, the mom just ""needs someone to blame"", as she says later, and of course she has to stick it on the hard-working, low-paid officers. Then, the police find the man, illegally enter his home, only to discover the son is already dead. Wow. Then, as the clichés roll on, the couple decide to get revenge on the man. Nothing in this movie ever deviates from formula. In fact, I'm not even sure if there IS a formula to this movie, as it seems like a jumbled mess.

Besides the formulaic, cliché plot line, the editing is horrible. Many times, a character might be saying something but their mouth isn't moving, or it's unsynchronized. Hence, the title of my review. Whoever edited this movie needs to go back to film school immediately.

Another thing is the picture and cinematography. The whole movie, save the flashbacks, is all washed out in color. This is a misconception with horror film directors that by washing out your film, it makes it scarier. All it does is make you look desperate and your film look amateurish. On another note, the cinematography was also abysmal, scoring no points for this otherwise dismal film. The shots were rough, almost feeling like a montage. They would have the same shot just moved a couple of inches over. Why they felt the need to do that is beyond me. Also, the shots had no style or feel to them, as if the editor and cinematographer just said ""screw it"" and slapped together the shots to make this movie.

Moreover, the movie is disgustingly graphic. What was once fresh and gripping in Se7en is now overall gross and appalling here. The couple shows no mercy as they torture their sons killer. At least John Doe had SOME shred of human decency! Additionally, it was horribly acted. I cannot fathom how these actors made it into Hollywood. They cannot act! I am half confident that I could do a better job then they did! Jesse Metcalf just sulked and sat there while Erika Christensen blathered on about how they would move on and find a better life. That was the whole first half of the movie.

Also, the script was disappointing. The dialogue was-- yes, you guessed it!-- all clichés! Jesse Metcalf says to Erika Christensen, ""Killing (our sons killer) isn't going to change anything."" Wow, the screenwriters couldn't come up with anything more original? That's sad.

To close, this was an abysmal, depressing, disgustingly graphic D movie with D list stars. I leave you with one thing: You'd be hard-pressed to find a worse horror movie then this."

1276,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/alone-in-the-dark/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,clem666,"Jan 31, 2021",2,"Painful movie to watch. It lasts for an hour and a half but it seems as long as a complete 10-season series. Sceanrio is disparate, inconsistent, impossible to clearly understand. Lighting is remarkably awful: 80% of the scenes are shot in almost total darkness. All protagonists are unattractive and have this strange emotionless acting. Decors and environments are terrible, and espacially the costumes since Boll used paintball armors to equip policemen. Music and sound effects are horrible and incoherent too. Dialogues are dull and flat. There is absolutely no link between the actual movie title, the eponymous video game and the plot of the movie. Who could have bet on the fact that a movie called 'Alone In the Dark' would show dozens of warriors against thousands of creatures? No one is actually alone, even if we are actually in the dark all along.

Only good point I found is that special effects on creatures are not that bad. However I can't say the same for special effects on deaths. A few (and only a few) frames and scenes are actually inspired. It deserves a 2/10 because of this and because this film does not have the real petty intention towards us. We have much to learn from the countless mistakes it makes."

What really takes the cake is the non existing storyline, pre-into to acting actors, and a gods awe-full music score.

And this isn't the first time he's done this to a video game.

If you finish it you're either a man or just stupid for having watched it in the first place. Take your pick. It could be both.

Acting/characters: Well, I don't need to tell you how bad it is because you've heard it a million times before. The characters are very laughable and they have no motive for doing what they do at all. They make the stupidest choices without any reason at all. The acting is just as bad as the characters. I normally cut actors a bit of slack because bad acting is usually (not always) 50% a bad screenplay and maybe 25% a bad director who controls all of the emotions and acting choices of the actors. But that still doesn't change the fact that everyone in this movie acts as stupid as their characters are. 0/10

Plot: This plot is as nonsensical as you get. You're expected to know a lot of things that you are never told. They attach significance to a lot of things without telling the audience why they are important or what happens if things go wrong. Do the bad guys want to take over the world? Do they want to just kill the good guys and just leave it there? Who is behind it and why? Is the main villain we see just some pawn or a host body or is he the mastermind of all of this? Why do a highly trained army of government secret alien defense soldiers never have to reload and can't hit anything? The plot holes are bigger than George Clooney's head when he won Best Supporting Actor (the same year this came out actually). It was just a mess. Plus the ending just added another giant plot hole to everything. Nice going. I looked on 5 or 6 different websites trying to get a decent plot explanation for this film. I found pretty much nothing. I did find this though. It's as close as we're going to get. 0/10

****/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/11343-alone



Screenplay: This was the worst part. The screenplay of this film made the acting and the plot very bad. There were many many cringe-worthy lines. I expected to laugh at a lot of the 'serious' lines, but they didn't even deserve that. They sounded like they were written by a drunk 8 year old. 0/10

Likableness: Like I said before, the plot was stupid, the acting was bad, and the screenplay was horrid too. I expected to come in at least laughing at the lines and getting entertainment value that way, but I didn't. Plus the special effects were some of the worst I've seen in a long time. I wouldn't suggest this one (although I don't mind that Irukandji suggested this one to me). It's fun to bash films like this. They certainly deserve it. 0/10

Final score: 0/40 (H)


TRIVIA TIME: 1. The lengthy opening text crawl was added after numerous test audience members said they were confused by the plot.

2. After execs read the green draft of the shooting script, the film got an additional $10 million. Uwe Boll poured the money into special effects.

3. Every piece of body armor worn by the various extra foot soldiers during major battle scenes is paintball body protection made by JT USA.

4. Nuclear Blast spend $30,000 on the soundtrack rights to promote their bands."

(very good console) and found myself transported to a dark and sureal story line with horror, suspence, mystery, and even religous lingo thrown in, and the survival aspect was best ever. this movie on the other hand had little to no suspence, the answer to the mystery was obvious, and the acting........ Is undescribably bad. there is no redeeming qualities in it. the story was nothing like the game, the remake was about the devil rising, and all of it was set in central park new york. the old game was set in a mansion. this one was set in a city. no central park, just a city. Is there anything that i can say that describes how stupid and assonine that is? The answer is no, I can not. And that's just the start of the crap, including the fact that it has the biggest loop hole in the world. So big that the grand canyon is a little crack in the pavement compared to it. At the end of the movie, there is a city that all the residents have been aparently eaten by the monsters. And there are no bodies, or blood. Oh my god. How does that work. If godzilla raged through that city, it would be destroyed. And there might be survivors, but there is no one there, and everything is intact. Great clean up job, guys. I am impressed.

It was like my 8 year old nephew was handed a decent sum of money to make the most ""super cool action alien movie of the year!""  The whole thing is an object lesson on what not to do in a movie, from the directing, special effects, casting, and sound.  It does it all, and it does it all badly to the point of wondering if you're being punk'd by Ashton Kutcher.  I can safely say that I found nothing to be redeeming in this movie: from Christian Slater's outfit and dialogue, to the fact that Tara Reid is supposed to be a scientist because she puts on glasses to make her ""look smart"".  They might as well have had her attempt an English accent, but then I'm sure the United States would be forced to apologize profusely for that insult to their country and accent.

As a fan of atlas shrugged and the fountain head, her ideals have played straight into the hands of moochers and thief's, and this is unacceptable.

Whether or not you agree with Rand's philosophy and politics, this movie is *objectively* awful (pun intended).

Once more, they've switched casts, and some of their choices are really strange.  Francisco is now clearly old enough to be Dagny's father, making their previous relationship really creepy, and possibly illegal.  It struck me as comical miscasting to have Rob Morrow play Hank Rearden, so I was really curious to see how that worked out.  Unfortunately, they cut him almost entirely out, having him only appear briefly in some of the narrated montages (more about those in a minute).

Most of the new actors do the best with what they've been given.  I really liked Mark Moses (Desperate Housewives) as Midas Mulligan, and even though he doesn't look the part, Kristoffer Polaha does a good job with John Galt.  In fact, he gives him significantly more personality that the book's character has.  Unfortunately, the script is so laughably bad that good acting can't save it.

As for the rest, the movie screams low budget at every turn.  They try to save money by filming much of it outdoors and in national parks - specifically Sequoia National park!  I don't mean that you occasionally catch a glimpse of a sequoia, I mean they rely heavily on them, even driving through the famous tunnel in the fallen tree - twice - just to remind you were it was really filmed.  I honestly think Aglialoro might not realize there are no sequoias in Colorado.   Don't get me wrong, these parts are beautifully filmed, and definitely the highlight of the movie, but the fact that an Ayn Rand movie relies so heavily on national parts is an irony that can only be lost on her true believers.

The parts that aren't in the woods are comically cheap.  Large parts are narrated over montages and even stock footage.  The sets and props they do use are strictly amateur hour.  I literally laughed out loud when they unveiled ""Project F"".

I'm assuming that everyone who sees this movie has read the book, which is good because there are some really glaring plot holes that wouldn't make sense otherwise.

Neither of the first movies was very good, but this one finally rises to the level of campy fun that makes it ""so bad its good"", and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that RiffTrax decides to take it on."

Atlas Shrugged is a great book that could have been a good movie.  But it is not.  It is bad in almost every way.  The direction is forced and without any sense of art.  The acting is amateurish to the extreme (there is a reason that each of the installments of this trilogy had new actors in every major part - each film was worse than the last).  Choosing to make the movie in the current time, while not changing the industries involved was lazy.  Trains and resources were far more important in the world Rand lived when she wrote this book than they are now.  Ignoring how truly bad this movie is, just because you are moved by the uber conservative politics the film espouses is a complete and utter insult to Ayn Rand's memory and Atlas Shrugged's view of the pursuit of greatness in all things."

The movie itself is a parody of 300 which is based on a comic series which based on a romanticized version of the historical battle of Thermopylae. They added a lot of jabs to other movies and jokes about pop culture.  Like I said it gets unbearable really fast. Hollywood lost the capability to make good or even decent parody movies long ago and this could be a low point. It was nominated for 5 golden raspberries and I was surprised it did not won.

We know this. We knew this before the movie came out, we knew this during its theatrical run and, six years after its release, we still know this. As a comedy, this film fails on all counts, because it's brutally unfunny. This film represents the very worst of American comedy. This is comedy that's gone through liposuction, and is suffering the immediate after-effect. It's painfully boring, painfully unfunny and painfully painful.

And what makes this even worse is the fact that Seltzer and Friedberg could actually be... talented. Bear with me for a moment, let me explain. Look at this film. While the humour and the parody (i.e. the reason we're watching the movie) fail, this film is competently made. The camerawork's quite good, as is the lighting, and I think, if it wasn't a comedy movie, the writing could be acceptable. If Seltzer and Friedberg were to sit down and try to write a decent story with decent dialogue that relied in no way on humour or wit, it would be decent.

It wouldn't be astounding, but it'd be decent. If they pushed the actors far enough, they could deliver good performances, I'm sure of that. I seriously doubt that all of the guys in this film are actually bad actors. Greg Sestero isn't a bad actor, as much as The Room will make you think otherwise. And I think a lot of the cast of this film could give decent performances. Not great, mind you, but decent.

It seems that the worst films of all time are unfunny comedies like this. By that I mean they all follow the same formula to create some of the most cringe worthy pieces of film in cinematic history: unfunny gross out humor, check; generic characters, check; no character development, check; plot as well put together as a half completed Jenga tower, check; mediocre editing, check; people acting as loud and annoying as possible, check; some of the worst acting performances you have seen in your life, check. I admire how ambitious the filmmakers were trying to be, but the writing is unspeakably atrocious. It is annoying how stupid the characters are. You get kinda a Scooby Doo meets American Pie vibe, which sounds good on paper. In fact, I'm sure with better execution this could of been a good movie.

1344,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/baby-geniuses/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,30Cents,"Jul 21, 2015",1,"We all come across some memorable and beautiful films a lot of the time, films that do not disappoint and makes us all happy. That is not the case with ""Baby Geniuses"", a film released in 1999 starring Christopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner as the main villains. The film was directed by Bob Clarke; if you are unfamiliar with this director, he directed the memorable holiday movie ""A Christmas Story"". So why did the director start to make these kind of films? We my never know.

""Baby Geniuses"" sounds like a movie that would come free with a box of diapers, put your child in the diaper and he/she will instantly become smarter than any other infant out there. These babies do not prove to be a genius at all, this film should be properly titled ""Baby Smart-alecs"". Because these so called ""babies"" have a bad mouth, cursing and fooling around with others to annoy the audience instead of being funny. Besides the fact that these infants are unlikable, all the other characters are about as hated as the toddlers. You should not care for any of the characters in the movie much less like them.

The jokes are all unfunny and some even repeat; for example, a few characters say the term ""diaper gravy"" a total of three times in the movie. I guess the screenwriters of the film liked this joke so much that they wanted to repeat a poop joke. Another example is when two men dressed as janitors try to capture one of the infants, the scene then turns into a cat-mouse situation where one of the men predict that they will be hit in the balls with a ski board. Obviously the man does get hit and walks out, the other man who is also dressed as a janitor comes and the exact same thing happens, I am not even kidding. Besides jokes repeating, every joke tries to be funny and original, none of the jokes are funny nor original.

The film starts out with the two main villains (played by Christopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner), they announce their new park properly titled ""Joyworld"". The scientists both think that every baby is born to use a secret language that adults cannot hear. One of the geniuses named Sylvester escapes the hands of the two villains by jumping in a dirty diaper truck (this is supposed to be funny for some reason). Sylvester finds his twin brother who apparently never knew each other for some reason, but one of them is kidnapped by the two villains and is tested to do more experimenting.

Another thing to mention is that when the infants talk their mouth never sync with the voices in the background. This happens from beginning to end, even the voices cannot help this movie be any better. The film editors could have made the infants not talk, but still have the voice overs. This film could have been like ""The Adventures of Milo and Otis"" where the animals never move their mouths, but still have voice actors talking for them.

""Baby Geniuses"" is a movie that should not have ever been shown to the public and instead left on the shelf. Be sure if you are buying/renting a family movie, make sure you walk past this one."

I honestly don't remember laughing once throughout the entire film. Just when you think it could not get more stupid, it does. The movie is gross and repulsive from beginning to end. Even though the lead is someone you can empathize with, there is no character development at all leaving a very drawn out and shallow cinematic experience.

You get what you expect from Dave Chappelle, but he can only bring a few laughs from this otherwise ill fated comedic mess. In many ways this film reminds me of 1941. Instead of making the attempt to write good comedy the film makers decide to have the actors just yell at each other the whole movie. Loud does not equal good comedy it is just annoying. I will say Danny DeVito was well cast, but ultimately his character got a little too creepy to enjoy. There are a couple plot twists that keep what is happening, but that does not change the fact that the movie is absolutely unfunny.
