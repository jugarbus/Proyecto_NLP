Love & Friendship

It's a bit cheesy, ridiculous and ironic tale retold in a light manner and keeps it all on surface despite of possessing such a deep and layered concept. Having said that, it doesn't suggest in any way that it doesn't lacks issues; it is chalky around the edges and volatile on emotions. The screenplay is fast paced and well structured; something that is unfamiliar to such genre, and that is what hooks the audience and keeps them on the edge of the seat. The technical aspects like production, costume and make-up design along with background score, is not one of its strength. The adaptation by Whit Stillman is smart and finely edited which latter also helps him on executing the anticipated vision as it grows effortless. It is quite difficult to portray such manipulative dislikeable character (addition to that she is hilarious too in her brutal sarcastic nature) and still mark an impression; is one of the main reason why Kate Beckinsale seems an appropriate choice. The tone of the feature is poised and visually rich that may come off a bit pretentious as it lacks proper technical aspects that should have actually been supportive and instead falls against it. Love & Friendship is not so lovable but surely a trustworthy friend that has an immensely powerful central character that changes one's perspective through its twisted yet somewhat justifying act."

Lady Vernon is devilishly charming and deceitfully charming played by Kate Beckinsale who even though has not impressed me before is delightful here, whilst Tom Bennet's preposterous upper class twit Sir James is the film's true scene-stealer. The script and dialogue are so tight and full of brilliant one-liners that the film screams for a second viewing which I will gladly oblige should the opportunity arise."
3,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/love-friendship/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,marcmyworks,"Dec 15, 2016",9,A beautiful and hilarious film. Kate Beckinsale truly proves that she can act beyond the 'Underworld' films. This is a tale of a manipulative mother trying to marry off her daughter (as well herself) while sponging off her relatives in the meantime.

5,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/love-friendship/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,smiyamot,"Sep 9, 2016",7,"An English talky movie about life in the 1800's, that is, how the upper class schemed to find suitable rich spouses.  Pretty (or handsome) but poor upper class looked for a match with rich but not pretty or smart types.  Seems so petty now but that was life back then, oh wait, maybe that's life now, not sure, ask the Kardashians.  The movie itself was done in a distinctive style, giving each actor an introduction and close up as they appeared in the movie; a nice touch.  You have to be in the mood for this movie or you'll snooze through it."

7,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/love-friendship/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Thomass,"Aug 21, 2016",10,"Love and Friendship, oddly named,is really quite excellent. It's one of those movies you have to play close attention to in order to get the machinations going on and the success or lack of. A great change of pace from bullets,car chases and superheroes."
8,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/love-friendship/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,jhep,"Jun 29, 2016",9,"This film works so well because it’s a kind of cautionary tale about toxic agendas and the people who become “possessed” by them. The film is a kind of horror story in which all the horror is just below the surface where (as Freud and Jung etc. have observed) it can do the most damage.

Kate Beckinsale, the delightful star of the film, and director Whit Stillman succeed so brilliantly in concocting their sardonic vision of 18th century English society that in many ways the result invites comparison with Alexander MacKendrick’s great and scathing 1957 muck-raking classic “Sweet Smell of Success”.

Beckinsale’s inspired, in fact jaw-dropping performance here as a sort of wayward 18th century Soccer Mom run amok and gone dangerously to seed is a challenge to describe in mere words. But begin by thinking Anne Bancroft’s Mrs. Robinson in “The Graduate” meets Nancy Reagan on a  Bad Hair day and you are on the right **** fact all of “Love and Friendship” feels VERY CONTEMPORARY and can be seen as a political metaphor for the emergence of today’s neoliberal social and economic environment complete with 1%-Push Coming Austerity-Shove !…..In a world in which the Looking-Out-for- Number-One lifestyle has become the order of the day and successfully implanted into our DNA, Kate Beckinsale’s sociopathic Lady Susan could easily be running for political office on a “Let them eat cake” ticket.

The film has a few momentary missteps and unfortunately these come in first five minutes and can have the effect of setting off considerable alarm bells……Happily this lapse in creative judgment is momentary and film quickly finds its own rhythm and soon moves from strength to strength. (The early lapses consist of a few “goofy” shots in which we are rapidly shown the names and faces of a dozen or so characters in the story. However, these shots which are intended as a sort of parody of early silent movies. are done so rapidly as to be meaningless as information and (more grievous artistically) don’t really work as parody because they’re out of place with the very traditional and very solid narrative that follows.

Whit Stillman is an extremely interesting filmmaker and his films “Metropolitan” and “The Last Days of Disco” are two of the most original American films of recent memory. Even more good news here is that both Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny who star here also starred in “The Last Days of Disco” and each instinctively understands “the Stillman universe”. In fact Beckinsale’s performance here is nothing short of mesmerizing and you can’t wait to see what she will say or do next !……But anyone deciding to see the film should go prepared for a more sombre Jane Austen story than usual (the Nancy Reagan/Mrs. Robinson angle) so maybe think Jane Austen with a hefty dollop of Henry James ……. but let me qualify this statement by pointing out that the note of moral seriousness is always present in Jane Austen’s work (and Whit Stillman’s for that matter) and that Austen has a knack of making her “sunshine” so welcome precisely because her “clouds” are real clouds and portend real downpours !……In fact Whit Stillman‘s “Love and Friendship” works so well because he understands this so thoroughly."

She is impossible to ignore and Sir James Martin is simple and simply hilarious. I didn't think Jane Austen was this funny.Kate Beckinsale and Tom Bennett should be remembered when it comes to award season."
10,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/love-friendship/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,nameless,"Jun 4, 2016",7,"It's a very good movie but you have to pay attention. The pacing was a little too regular for me, started to lose focus in the middle. The ending is left a bit ambiguous which threw things off for me. We were led through most of the film and our job was to keep up and then it ended like some art film. Can't agree with the negative reviews."
11,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/love-friendship/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Bikerjames,"May 31, 2016",8,"Kate Beckinsale shines as the scheming Lady Susan.  Tom Bennett is hilarious as the silly Sir James Martin and the rest of the cast great as well.  The dialogue is quick and occasionally difficult to follow, but you can still keep up with the movie even if you miss a phrase here and there.  Costumes and locations were excellent.  Most of the movie takes place indoors, which makes it feel like you are watching a play.  Thoroughly entertaining."
12,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/love-friendship/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GinaK,"May 30, 2016",9,"I didn’t expect to like this movie, but I really loved it. It is beautiful to look at, full of excellent performances, especially Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny, and it has a brilliantly witty script. I saw a quote from a review in an ad for this film that said it was “screamingly funny” – and believe it or not – it is. The only problem is that you have to have a little patience with it – there are many characters and Whit Stillman does his best to present them as quickly and economically as possible – but once you catch on to who is who and what exactly they are after, the film is very, very funny."
13,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/love-friendship/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Spangle,"May 27, 2016",9,"Love & Friendship is a truly brilliant film from director Whit Stillman. As whitty, subtle, sharp, and smart, as ever, Stillman expertly brings Jane Austen's work to life in this fantastically funny film. Outlandish and truly hysterical, Love & Friendship touches on themes such as marriage, love, religion, and, as with all Stillman films, the bourgeoisie. This film really portrays the upper class as being incredibly uppity, insipid, and stupid, in the most hysterical ways possible. Incredibly well-written, this very large cast of characters are all handled very well during this short 90 minute film with all of their subplots being expertly handled by Stillman's sure hand. Featuring good cinematography and incredible production/costume design, Love & Friendship's look an feel is as lush, extravagant, and gorgeous, as required of a period piece. In terms of the acting, Kate Beckinsale is a comedic wonder in this film. Completely deadpan with great delivery and timing, Beckinsale sweeps you off your feet with fantastic delivery of Stillman's witty and subtly brilliant dialogue. Overall, Love & Friendship is a true wonder of a film that will go down as one of the funniest films of 2016."
14,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/love-friendship/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,brownbat,"May 20, 2016",9,"One of Whit Stillman's best, and a great adaptation. In an interview on Bullseye, Stillman explained how most Austen adaptations can fall short, by playing up the romanticism and missing Austen's cutting humor. This was more faithful to Austen, and her material was a great vehicle for Whit Stillman's approach to dialogue-driven comedy, which has always felt like a mix of classic and modern. If you like Stillman, or if you've just been waiting for an Austen adaptation that captures her tone better, you'll love it."

21,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hereditary/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,BigYeedus,"Aug 16, 2024",10,"Horrifying, gut-wrenching stuff.  The most brutal smash cut in the history of the genre.  Toni Collette should have nabbed an Oscar for this.  She goes to some dark places to fully convey the grief and rage of her character. Says a lot about the inevitability of death, and how freeing it can be to realize the lack of control one can have over life's circumstances.  It's almost giddy to think about how little of a chance everyone in this movie really had."
22,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hereditary/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Astar1977,"Jul 23, 2024",10,"This is horror made with intelligence, one or two jump scares in the whole movie, which kept me grabbed to my chair with a depressing story (in the good way), the end is unpredictable and shows true evil, the downward spiral in which the main character falls is terrifying and the fact that it doesn’t rely on the supernatural but on the complete destruction of the psique makes it even scarier as it could happen to anyone, believer or not.
In my opinion this is a masterpiece."

24,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hereditary/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,NolanH,"Nov 24, 2023",10,"Truly the most disturbing movie that I have ever seen, in the best possible way. This is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Toni Collette is a powerhouse and puts forward the best acting performance I have ever seen in a horror movie, bar none. The kids, played by Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro, are no slouches either. This film sends the viewer up and down a sickening roller-coaster of emotions that you just can't turn away from. I signed up for an account just so I could give this film a 10."
25,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hereditary/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Redrex45,"Nov 9, 2023",10,"Hereditary is without a doubt one of the most frightening, deeply disturbing, and evocative pieces of horror I have ever seen. Instead of scaring you right away, the film slowly takes its time to build a bone chilling atmosphere and genuinely get under your skin. Hereditary uses its isolating cinematography, tense dialogue, and bloodcurdling soundtrack to quietly whisper to you that something unspeakably horrifying is bound to befall its cast of characters. The characters themselves are all impeccably acted and written to feel like real people. Each of the characters have their own multi-layered fears and traumas that they attempt to deal with throughout the story. The film explores how a family can slowly be driven apart through grief and tragedy as well as the horrific consequences this can have on the lives of each of the family members. Overall Hereditary is not for everyone and isn't an easy movie to watch. It is very clammy, unnerving, and disturbing. But if you are looking for a mature horror story that grounds its terror in human emotion and is genuinely frightening, this is the movie for you."
26,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hereditary/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,PSONetto,"Nov 2, 2023",10,"A true terror story.

This isn't a generic mediocre jump-scare movie, it hooks you into fear by a fine tailored and detailed plot that leads you to the answers to the questions the movie gave to you."
27,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hereditary/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DarkwingSchmuck,"Nov 1, 2023",9,"Hereditary is a breakout film for writer/director Ari Aster. It's a smart, character-driven horror film that is full of suspense and lingering terror. However, standing above all of the high quality technical craft is Toni Collette's tour de force performance. It was an absolute crime she wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this role."

We yelled is it imaginary what is going on? I didn't know but I was intrigued and loved looking at the amazing visuals and States design.

Really glad I watch this movie it is terrifying but not in that it's gonna scare you with a scream terrifying in like the ideas and what you see are just disturbing enough to stain your mind when you go to sleep.

Really good acting could not have asked for more and the movie just keeps getting weird and weirda."

Hereditary is one of the best films ever made, the acting is absolutely incredible, and the story is so horrifying I couldn't sleep without looking at my walls and ceiling for weeks. There wasn't one time I smiled or had some fake laugh; it was horror done proper; demon possession done proper. The last twenty minutes of the film are so uncomfortable that I watch this movie still each year as it has affected me to this day."

36,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hereditary/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Koukaboora,"Apr 27, 2022",7,"I enjoyed this movie apart from a couple of aspects. I'm glad that I missed the hype train on this one cause I went into with a blank slate. If you are looking for a film with a lot of jump scares then this isn't your movie. This movie is more unsettling than sudden jump scares, which I like more. My biggest issues with the movie was the direction of the story (It all works together but is kind of dumb) and the main guy looked a little too old for the part. Though he did do a good job with the majority of the film. I'd recommend this movie if you are a fan of more passive horror that creeps you out rather than outright scares you."
37,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hereditary/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,AJ_13,"Apr 11, 2022",8,"Hereditary is a clear example of how performances and screenplay can elevate a horror film. Gathers many of classical horror elements and the influence of films such as Rosemary's Baby is palpable.

In terms of staging it doesn't reach Midsommar, but it still is Ari Aster's finest film to date."
38,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hereditary/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,HellHoleHorror,"Apr 1, 2022",7,"Whilst I really enjoyed this horror I thought that it only got good from the first seance. The first section was just too slow, I almost didn’t even make it through. The scary moments are really intense and stayed with me for days, very much the way that The Exorcist (1973) stayed with me when I first watched it. Apart from the dull elongated shots of nothing and slow conversations about nothing in the first half the rest of the film is perfectly paced revealing the story is a near perfect way. Acting, sound design, cinematography are all excellent. This is a really scary film that will stay with you so long as you get through the slow first part."

Not if he blew it out of the water, no, the ocean. ""Hereditary"" is monumental, clever and one of the scariest movies in history.
It might be from Toni Collette's astonishing performance, the breathtaking scenes, the out-of-this-world clever details, or the overall intense and amazing concept. Clocking in at 2 hours, you are already on the edge of your seat at the first 15 minutes while the final 20 minutes will have you covering your eyes, waiting for the final reveal."

This and more represented so broadly both in script and in the audiovisual field that you can watch the film several times and if you pay a little more attention, you can get a new surprise every time you watch it.
Also it shows the best performances of the leading actors: Toni Collette, Alex Wolff, Milly Shapiro, Gabriel Byrne and Ann Dowd. Ari Aster creates a classic snapshot of horror cinema and which will be taken as the main point of reference for future generations.
All technical aspects are excellent and original, but the most remarkable thing is soundtrack, this being one of the most terrifying and immersive ever made."

The talent is evident here for the director and the movie is a family drama for more then the first half and by the end it becomes a ferocious and effective pure horror. I enjoyed it and I found it pretty original tough it's obviously a derivative movie. It felt like a well done genres mix (family drama and  horror) with an art house production design and it clearly succeeds in its intent to be scary even if it isn't disturbing (as for example ""The Witch"" actually is, less scary but certainly more disturbing). This movie is not a masterpiece but it is a good One of course. A movie destined to become a cult."

The atmosphere drips with tension and creepiness. There are no cheap jump scares. The director understands that what you don't see is much scarier than what you do see (unlike a lot of other horror film makers these days). Toni Collette is something else in this, she has to play a wide range of emotions and she is just incredible. It's a slow burn and its a bit long, but I was glued to the screen the entire time."

The film is best experienced fresh, so all I can say is, it's a must-watch film for any horror fan, and anyone on the fence about the film, I'm sure you will get your spooks your looking for while being extremely uncomfortable throughout the run time.

From the get go, Hereditary unsettled me. The slow and sweeping camera angles, the creepy young girl character Charlie, and the inescapable feeling that some huge scare was on its way. But the film holds back so effectively on the jump scares. It chooses psychological and audio horror over visual scares, until much later on. The acting is on the whole excellent and powerful, and brings to Life a particularly terrifying and grisly event that happens in the first half of the film. It's a film that affects psychologically, and is in that sense a cut above nearly every other modern day horror I've seen. The final few scenes do rush up on the viewer perhaps a little too quickly, and at first viewing seem bizarre, but all make sense when you think about them afterwards. A modern horror classic."

I'm really not a fan of the recurring 0815 Jumpscare horror flicks and so I'm all the more happy that Hereditary is breaking clichés with most horror genres.

This is not conjuring or insidious part 30, but refreshing horror food that is damn creepy.

The film creates a really disgusting, threatening atmosphere that makes you shudder again and again. In addition, some scenes are staged incredibly disturbing and penetrate to the core.

You have to have a lot of respect for the acting performance of everyone involved, that's really great.

All in all, a damn creepy, disturbing horror trip."

On them he reflects on various topics ranging from life, his family, his films and Hollywood in general. To accompany these revelatory tapes, archival footage and clips from his films confirm or contradict what he is saying (depending on how much you love his films). What comes through strongly, though, is the sheer presence and magnetism of both the man and the actor, even if the man comes across as somewhat reclusive and subdued, shy even! His sense of disappointment with the industry he shone in is acutely felt, as is his dissatisfaction with most of his films and the performances he gave in them. It’s true that many of his movies were either overrated or just plain bad, but I defy anyone seeing the clips here to not find themselves wanting to revisit at least some of them. He also endured more than his share of personal tragedy which weighs in here to paint a picture of a not particularly happy, if extremely talented, man.

Lazzaro the protagonist, is an innocent character that is happy to make others happy, in the pureness of his heart. He doesn't know who is his father of mother just who is maybe his grandmother.There are very few signs of when this passes you can guess the 60 or 70's till later you see a cellphone of the 90's. So this is the condition that those people lives.They live under Marchesa Alfonsina De Luna state till one day Lazzaro meets the rebellious son of her, Tancredi, that wants to live away from the rot of his bankrupt family, so he devise a plan.A plan that unwillingly ends ends with and event that throws Lazzaro in the future 20 to 30 years ahead. By chance or destiny he meet robbers in the now decadent rural mansion (not knowing that they are people of his past ""family"") and in the city where he is recognized by an old female friend (the role is played by the older sister of Rohrwacher, Alba) - the only one that sees the miracle of him not ageing anything at all (and not all broken and bloody by the event that happened so many years ago, not seen by **** this urban future he ends up living within the same ignorant and individualist clan (with some exceptions) and ends up meeting by chance the Baroness son again, decadent as ever in his dreams of richness that broke his spirit. Not telling the end after all this spoilers, but it is sad to see Lazzaro so pure treated as nothing, unhappy by his friend status, and trying to correct things in a wrong way in his innocency (no, it doesn't have an happy ending). A movie that may not be for everyone but that shines to see such saintness and pureness of heart among our society.Good cinematography and choice of colors, with Kodak Super 16mm film by cinematographer DP Hélène Louvart AFC  and good acting by the protagonist, the newcomer Adriano **** would score this one a 8.0 out of 10.0 / A-."

I felt frustrated by those who chose to exploit him (if but only mildly) and indeed, exploitation is certainly a relevant theme in this film, as well as tolerance perhaps. I liked/respected the simplicity aspect of it. It has a positive feel about it.

73,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/happy-as-lazzaro/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,KenR,"Oct 21, 2021",8,"Happy As Lazzaro – The Smell **** Man
Tuscan-born writer/director Alice Rohrwacher has created an Award-winning allegorical observation on how the average person stumbles along, following the ruling classes orders of the day. Most live without stopping to analyze the derogatory impact, this almost hidden manipulation, has on our everyday understanding of the true meaning of life. Curiously, the writer based part of this strange story on a factual newspaper story! The manipulation of the poorer classes by greedy conglomerates - fleecing workers for a pittance in return for endless hard labor. How empty modern lifestyles can offer little more benefits than those of the slave workers, too often pushing the good in humanity to obscurity.   It’s not a film for everyone and many viewers may miss important messages within this thoughtful work – perhaps one reason could be because they blindly accept the hidden economic controls, enforced on the world’s working classes. ‘Lazzaro’ is both enigmatic and silently devastating to any viewer prepared to consider how the world’s bankers – pervade every aspect of modern life - often reducing it to rubble for struggling nations.  It's little coincidence this film comes to its haunting conclusion inside a bank!  It’s a longish tale (2 hrs) so needing a patient, discerning audience. It could possibly have conveyed its thoughtful message in less time but those attuned to reading between the lines of our every day news media...will be quite willing to take the journey. Fascinatingly the filmmaker is able to convince the viewer to accept quite jarring, bizarre twists, as if we trust somehow they are taking us towards a meaningful outcome.  Sought after French cinematographer Hélène Louvart provides the darkly probing visuals. There is an interesting piano soliloquy that plays out here and there but the film has no score composer. Performances are uniformly good, making this a treat for those who like to think about their entertainment – the sensitive viewer might find the final scene one not easily forgotten (aided by a Wolf and some Italian folklore)"

je suis aller voir ce film en me disant que c'était un film d'animation pour ado qui à l'air sympa.... au final j'ai écouté l'album du film pendant 2 semaines non-stop.

je l'ai regardé une deuxième fois chez moi et j'ai finalement compris le message incroyable du film : le syndrome de l'imposteur.

le visuel est ma gni fique ! ils ont cassé les codes avec un visuel très dessin, très comics qui intéressait personnes. aujourd'hui c'est l'un des plus grand film d'animation et c'est amplement mérité. 

la scène du ""leap of faith"" que dire....

c'est aussi super intéressant d'avoir une autre perception du personnage de spiderman. une autre personne, une autre famille, une autre histoire.  N'importe qui peut être Spiderman et c'est un message très bien retranscrit dans celui-ci (même si Peter restera à jamais gravé dans la roche). 

ce film m'a aussi rappelé les vieux jeux de l'époque comme **** Dimension ou Edge of Time. rien que pour cela c'est déjà un banger pour moi."

86,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,tbruh,"Nov 25, 2024",10,"This is peak.

Art + Animation - It's peak. The vibrant comic book artstyle, the stunning New York backdrops, the minute detail in the interiors. The animation even serves a narrative purpose, with Miles being animated off frame to look janky and less fluid than Peter, Gwen and the other Spider people, only to be animated smoothly once he performs the brilliant leap of faith.

Characters - They're peak. Miles Morales is such a good character, not falling into the Hollywood sarcastic, skilled, sick of everyone personality craze that they seem to love so much. Miles is genuine, clumsy, funny, ambitious, scared, flawed yet loveable. He's someone who looks up to Spiderman in a similar way the audience does and when that responsibility is thrust onto him, he reacts relatably but rises to the challenge by the end.
Going into personal bias, seeing Miles enter a new elite school environment, knowing mentally that he proved himself enough to get in yet emotionally feeling stupider than everyone else in class, is a feeling I know all too well. His struggles to find friends, him butting heads with his dad while still obviously loving him, trying to prove himself to others and himself. And he's black? Yeah, he just like me frfr.
The other characters are all good too. Peter B Parker being this older, jaded and genuinely sad Spiderman is such a contrast to how he's portrayed in other movies, yet it makes sense all that he goes through. Gwen Stacy, both resitant to making friends and deepening relations and also being 'fast' friends with Miles (after the hair incident). Uncle Aaron, Officer Jeff, Rio, the other spiders, there are so many good characters and dynamics that really elevate the movie.

Story - It's peak. The spiderman story has been done and redone many times. Nerdy kid, spider bite,Uncle Ben, responsibility, yada yada. Spiderverse acknowledges how over done this character and IP is and takes it in a new direction. Mile's story isn't just about responsibility. It's about rising up to the challenge. Just like in his school life, he has the ability, just not the confidence to take that leap. It's hard to talk more about the story without spoiling, but trust me, it's peak.

Having a movie be so relatable while simultaneously so well made is truly a once in a multiverse experience. Corny line but it's true. Go watch."

Given the steamroll of positive word-of-mouth, I had concerns about this one living up to my expectations. Instead, it smashed them to pieces. It surprises, delights, amuses and entertains right from the opening gun. A sharp, witty script manages to nail the goofy essence of the character (seen through a kaleidoscope of different lenses) without feeling forced, hokey or dated. It's effortlessly hip and tuned-in, a tale that understands what's fresh and spotlights that without exploiting it. The plot remains light-hearted and smooth, but not without trials or consequences.

I don't think I can say nearly enough about the dynamic, electrifying visuals. They're a shot of adrenaline, consistently vibrant and dazzling, a vivid showpiece that leaps straight from page to screen without sacrificing any of the clever little quirks and format-conscious tricks that always seemed so inseparable from the printed medium. Into the Spider-Verse is the first time a big comic book adaptation has really worn its roots as a badge of honor, something to be respected and embraced, rather than an embarrassing blemish. It understands what makes a good comic tick, values those singular traits and uses them to improve the entire production. I didn't realize how much I needed something like this.

Updated thoughts from a 2021 re-watch: I've already reviewed this one in depth, so I'm going to take a chill pill and dial back the long-winded analysis. It's still awesome. Jaw-dropping visuals, catchy and effective soundtrack, wonderful writing. What more can you really ask for? There's so much good **** buried in the details, little love letters to the long-term fans that show how well the writers know the character, but the bold-faced main plot stuff works too. Kingpin's motivations and comeuppance. The powerful side-arc with The Prowler. Miles growing into the role, physically and psychologically. And everything's so effortlessly quick-witted, without sacrificing the ground-level struggles that have always made Spider-Man so relatably human. How much longer do I need to wait for a sequel?"

It was a blizzard! I really do not appreciate it. The visual style of the film made it come alive like a comic book. DC should learn lessons from this animation in order to be successful. Yes. Cultural diversity, interesting twists, expert voice actors, different narratives, etc., all of them are trying to make it a masterpiece and it will be. Although I don't see it as the best work of Spider-Man, because there is another movie called No Way Home, which completely upset me and It dealt more with the misfortunes of Peter Parker. But we are extremely satisfied with this. This movie is a blessing for us fans and critics that we should appreciate."

This is a work of art. I think the story is incredible as well, and now that I've seen it three times, there are so many subtle symbolic images across the plot that make the payoff all the more satisfying. Personally, I think the climax of the film is not when Miles wins, but rather when Miles jumps off the side of that building and we get that jaw-dropping, show-stopping shot of him falling upside down to the night city and swinging through it with confidence. 10/10 no questions asked."

Now fast-forward to today with the second movie coming up, I decide to watch it again to prepare myself for that movie and honestly, this movie has aged so beautifully it's remarkable. The first thing it does to make you excited is subvert your expectations when you see some characters, you don't initially think too much about them but then when they're all of a sudden so much more than just random people, it manages to capture you off guard because you're used to talking to people that have no impact and when it turns out they do, they stay with you long after the movie will end. The main cast of characters are all excellent and have amazing and diverse personalities to ensure everyone sticks out and helps you remember everyone so well to help drive the story to 11 and stop it from feeling generic. But also, Miles Morales here might be one of the greatest MCU characters to exist with how he's written and the performance given by the actor is nothing short of amazing. The soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks I've heard recently for a movie with how it manages to capture the feeling of hopelessness, being at your lowest point, humor, and excitement so well and never lets go of it. The low frame-rate might look concerning, but with how it compliments the art-style and camera, it's actually not so bad when you look at it in motion. Speaking of the art-style, it's easily the best part about the movie with how gorgeous it is thanks to the varied color palette, bouncy sound effects, and the beautiful animation due to the low frame rate. The easter eggs are simply amazing and are a treat for Spider-Man fans like the Insomniac 2018 suit. Overall, I loved this movie from the top of my heart and has only heightened my excitement for the sequel so much more."

138,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-shape-of-water/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MartinAZ,"Feb 2, 2021",8,"A fairy tale set in post-modern America. A tale about a princess without voice and the monster that almost destroyed it all. Guillermo Del Toro tells a heartwarming story. The design of the creature is amazing! The lead actress (Sally Hawkins) compliments the story and the support actor (Richard Jenkins) does a wonderful narration.

What I hated. When a world is presented as realistic, it posses a question as to what exactly ""realistic"" means. As far as I know, the only two mythical components are the creature and Elisa. Any government, at any time of handling such a sensitive asset would not behave in this way. Any one who knows about area 51 can tell how guarded alien evidence is handled (Even if it's the 1960's). The creature is not only alien but has proven to poses abilities and the Russians aren't interested when told?

How cleaning ladies managed is not only unbelievable but an insult to how sensitive government information is handled. There weren't even guards at the cleaning vans and only one camera that was easily tilted up because they left barrels underneath. Are there no guards watching this kind of sensitive asset or this government can't afford 2 or 5 more guards.

This kind of incompetence is very subtle and littered through out the movie. It is every clear that Guillermo Del Toro shows us how characters out wit the government on a bases of clumsiness and luck.

With that said; clumsiness and luck aren't uncommon. There is a ton that I love and the pros out weigh the cons. I recommend to not only watch this movie but it falls in my category or must owns.

I give the Shape of Water a 8.5 out of 10. A modern fairytale story."

It won over Get Out, Lady Bird and Dunkirk??!! It's a good film, but just not a great one. I personally don't like how much audiences hate this movie.I think it's a really good technical achievement and has some outstanding performances. But it's a huge oscar bait. With Guillermo Del Toro as director and you have Octavia Spencer, Michael Shannon and Richard Jenkins in the cast with a score by Alexandre Desplat, what more could the oscars ask for? The movie is quite bland to me in the second half of the film. It starts off brilliantly, with a great script and beautiful production design. The film doesn't quite reach those levels in the second half, with it just feeling way too forced and dull. The ending is great though, with a heart-wrenching sequence. The score, editing, production design and costumes are masterful. Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins are outstanding in the film, with Del Toro's direction also noteworthy. But the script just feels way too plucky and bland. Don't get me wrong. I think it's a really good movie. IT's just that, Best picture?? Not thank you."

The Shape of Water is a well-oiled takedown of not only the nuclear family but also the overly romanticized cold war era and suburban family. Eliza Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a tragic hero, a loving soul trapped in a mute body, forced to deal with brutal workplace harassment. Sally Hawkins gives an excellent performance and Richard Jenkins portrays an equally tortured character, a freelance artist exploited and tooled about by Corporate America who pursues a path of unrequited gay love. The creature effects are on par with del Toro’s past projects, i.e. utterly phenomenal. The Shape of Water’s only major flaw is that Strickland (Michael Shannon) is too cartoonish of a villain."

One of the great things this film has to offer is its cinematography, it's very astounding. The color palette of this film just brings you the vibe of something cold. The direction is also amazing.

And, unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to them. It's a visually stunning film; there's no doubt about that. And Guillermo del Toro once again proved that he is a great director (and possibly the best when it comes to monster movies), but the story was ultimately disappointing to me. It was extremely simple and didn't have a whole lot of depth to it. Yes, it's interesting to see a woman fall in love with a non-human being, but take away the fact that it wasn't human and it was not a a very far throw away from a typical love story. At the same time, the slightly lackluster story doesn't take away from some incredible performances in this film, from Sally Hawkins to Michael Shannon...they are all fantastic.

167,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-shape-of-water/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,AndrewBurge,"Apr 16, 2018",8,"It is easy to see why Guillermo del Toro's 'The Shape of Water' won Best Picture at the Oscars. It mixes its ideas and concepts with luxurious and exquisitely designed cinematography, ever-present and polished score and a near compulsive obsession with details when it comes to set decoration. All in all, this is a very pretty film to watch.

But, this is not what makes it special. It is rather the way this imagery is not shallow and pedantic without any effect. Del Toro puts his money where his mouth is and presents us with true ambitious directing and writing when it comes to presenting the love story between a mute janitor Eliza (Sally Hawkins) working at a top secret research facility during the Cold War era and 'The Asset'; an amphibious and marvelous creature. You wanted diversity? Honestly, it doesn't get more diverse than this.

Still, there are a few flaws, unfortunately. Despite the near-perfect pacing of the action and daring but at the same time tamed sex scenes, there are a few hiccups here and there that break the magic of this fantastical love story. Like Giles' (Richard Jenkins), Eliza's only friend,  homosexual approach towards a friendly waiter and a racist scene involving the same waiter not letting a Negro couple sit at the table. Of course, this all makes sense, its the 60s.

It is easy to compare 'The Shape of Water' with del Toro's 2006 masterpiece, ""Pan's Labyrinth"", both involving a fantastic hidden world in a political unsettling backdrop, but the magic is cut short here. There is also a scene in which Eliza dreams of singing and dancing with the monster, which is beautiful but is also a bit cringe-worthy. Yet the amphibious creature is more than it seems. It presents supernatural powers of healing and displays superiority against his captor, Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) a supremacist and self-loathing American man charged with the security of The Asset. Why did it show its powers so late in the film, its a mystery. But at least its powers are renowned, for as Strickland, considering the beast a primitive and inferior being, in the end claims 'F**k, you are a god!'

If it wasn't for the sublime and crystal polished execution of all its technical elements (and some artistic ones) this film would have been worse. But, let's not forget that is the imagery and the sound the exclusive elements of cinema. I mean, the Academy definitely holds true to this and respects filmmakers which endorse that idea."
168,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-shape-of-water/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,PipeC,"Apr 15, 2018",10,"A monstrously powerful fable about love and loss where plot simplicity, narrative depth and artistic beauty are unified and glorified.  Without false decorations, there is no doubt that ""The Shape of Water"" is an eye-catching drop-dead gorgeous masterpiece, Del Toro's last Magnum opus is a eerie and charming homage to ordinary-people-do-extraordinary-things stories and, without hyperbolizing my extreme love for this filmmaker— although that's just the truth —his film is one of the most clever, stirring and visually handsome experiences, a deeply moving and impressive modern-cinema classic, an artistically perfect, beautifully acted, directed and scripted impossible-love movie that I have seen in my whole life.

For the most stringent movie-buffs, like me, the first thing coming to light when the screening is over is that the script has many plot holes, namely, neither it provides minimal explanation about how or why was the creature created, nor uses scientific technicalities or the peripheral problems of the main role, the supporting characters or the time in which it's developed; the film simply doesn't walk around and to enjoy it is necessary to understand it in the way its director wants: As a story about monsters in which love and loss, as a whole, play the greatest roles. This film allows executing extraordinary tours de force for two members of the cast. Year after year, the great Michael Shannon surprises more and more. His Richard Strickland is voracious, egomaniac, magnetic and terrifying; this performance is made by real quality, portraying a man oppressed by machismo, greed and power, possibly a reflex that reconciles in a good way with the mess of sexual and labor harassment that has begun to be strengthened in recent months, an epitome of all those monsters with ties and contacts that simply require and cancel. On the other side of the coin, the second monumental performance lies, of course, on the shoulders of Sally Hawkins, getting that a mute lady gains a powerful label, not a new icon of female overcoming or anything by style, a sign of love, faith, and freedom. Del Toro keeps doing his job excellently, selecting a top-notch artistic team. Flick after flick, story after story are strongly driven by an overwhelming visual tidiness, leaving out genre or purpose, it's a tradition that each of its motion pictures means sublimity in creative fields. His newest work could be placed on the top of the podium.  ""The Shape of Water"" is what it's thanks to the hard work put on it, a feat that must be recognized and praised. Dark colors and lack of brightness are trademarks, each scene uses the global tonality in order to encompass throughout the film the feeling that the filmmaker wants the spectator to get. While in the opening sequence prevails a gloomy green color in the water, in the later set-pieces you can appreciate green olives, pale whites, yellowish and greenish blues that give shape to the idea. In addition, such colors are also applied to costumes, makeup, staging and visual tricks, supported by an ideal and particularly opaque illumination that denotes a quietly beautiful time. Pictures are flawless. Its cinematography embellishes key scenes and the ingenious approaches switching from one scene to another use old-school techniques that Del Toro frequents, and here get a new level of complexity and intensity, simply outstanding. Alexandre Desplat is also an important piece in the puzzle, he plays again a role of issuer of emotions by means of sound, through a work that surely will give him besides an enormous recognizing, satisfaction and pride for becoming one of the most requested Hollywood composers. Guillermo Del Toro's ""The Shape of Water"" is a devastating experience, not due to its subtle horror moments, its entertaining material or its mischievous comic sense, but  simplicity and delicacy with which this filmmaker treats his invention, a work brimming with gold qualities that are not created by film-romantic traditionalism, the core purpose is a message about loss and happiness, because this, in many cases, means love, and that's precisely the meaning of the movie title. In its entirety, water may never be contained, water is amorphous, love is amorphous, therefore, its conceptions are entirely immeasurable. It's one of the best years for Mexico in the American industry thanks to ""Coco"" and ""The Shape of Water"", it's also time to remunerate all the contributions for cinema made by this peculiar filmmaker. While some people give him millions of dollars and little gold men, we, the dreamers and most loyal followers, give our deepest respect, admiration and gratitude, becoming, at least personally, a true role model."
169,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-shape-of-water/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TheQuietGamer,"Apr 13, 2018",9,"One of the things with Guillermo del Toro's works that has always appealed to me is that quite often they feel like gothic-fairytales. Both in tone and particularly in the visual style. The Shape of Water continues that trend, only completely ditching the gothic aspect in favor of going full-on storybook mode on us. Right from the get go it feels like a Disney princess movie. Just one that is made for the adults who grew up on them instead of the youngsters. Make no mistake, the maturity level of this movie makes it far less family-friendly than anything Walt ever gave us. However, it is no less heartwarming. Yes, the species difference between the two lovers does make for a bizarro love story. Yet none of the emotional resonance is lost in the face of it's girl-meets-monster setup. There is a scene in the movie where protagonist Elisa describes why she wants to be with/save her aquatic beau that honestly had me on the verge of tears. In that moment actress Sally Hawkins pours her heart out, makes us feel her pain, and gives a speech about how she has found the love we all hope for and that everyone deserves. And she does it without words. Someone tell Duncan Jones that this is how you portray mute individuals. Hawkins performance is astounding. Every facial expression is meaningful. She is able tell us everything we need to know with but a simple look. The heart, soul, and touching power of the material would not have been able to flow without her.


On top of being a remarkable romance and period piece, del Toro has also made The Shape of Water to be a slice of Hollywood nostalgia as well. Tons of throwbacks to classics and the feeling of being from a bygone era of film is sure to provide a kick to those longtime cinema enthusiasts or just those who have experimented more out of this current time period when watching movies. I wonder though if this is what caused Water's only flaw. That being it is a little too predictable. You basically know how the events are going to play out as they are transpiring. A slight disappointment, but it ultimately does almost nothing to hurt what is one of the most gorgeous, touching, and romantic films I have ever scene. It is the perfect example of the kind of warmth I wish to find in my own life and del Toro has outdone himself as a director.

It is an absolutely beautiful film from a director well known for strange monster films, and this might possibly be his best, if not it will be ranked highly among his best, right up there with Pan's Labyrinth.

Guillermo del Toro is at his peak with not just interesting visuals (the production design is top notch and the design for the creature is stunning), but also one of the most resonating stories of his career. Not just for it's combination of drama, fantasy, romance, and 50s sci-fi kitsch, but because of how socially conscious the story is, all the while still being timeless and universal. It is a story about how humans can understand the suffering of a fish, the story **** man wanting to find a connection with a world he hides from, the story of a black maid wanting to keep her head down from injustice, a mute girl who wants something more in life, a true blue American who does not know who is the true monster, and of course, a romance where a human falls in love with a fish.

All of which is contained with some fantastic performances from Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, Doug Jones, and career highlights for Michael Shannon and Sally Hawkins, Guillermo and Vanessa Taylor's delicate yet crowd pleasing script, the previously mentioned stellar production design, and del Toro's masterclass direction.

There is a reason why it won Best Picture. Debate all you want, this will go down as one of the best films to have receive this honor!"

The deportation involved no due process and therefore can't be said to have been legitimized by the rule of law. As the movie points out, the deportation relied instead on a legal concept called the Law of Necessity: a self-justification engaged in by the town after the fact, used to rationalize the extra-legal removal by a deputized, armed mob of both the workers and (most revealingly) other residents who opposed the action.... About the Law of Necessity, suffice it to say that it is the sham-legal shield of lynch mobs in all times and places."

181,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-duke-of-burgundy/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,alwayswatching,"Jan 4, 2016",8,"""The Duke of Burgundy"" is a movie about dynamics of sex between Cynthia (Sidse Babett Knudsen) and her maid, Evelyn (Chiara D'Anna). But I would like to read more into it and think it is also a movie about guilt.

The setting, characters, and order of events in the movie does not resemble anything in real life. The is no sense of time, there are no men around at all, and people have unusual professions. This all indicates that the the story is happening inside someones head.

From the opening scene we see that Cynthia is cruel to her maid. She punishes the made with pithy excuses. At one point in the movie, we see her opening a big coffin-like box in the woods to find the maid's skeleton in it. It appears that Cynthia's cruelty killed the maid.

Rest of the movie shows how Cynthia is coping with her guilt. She goes through a mental gymnastic to convince herself she is not guilty. She imagines what she could have done differently. She deceives herself into thinking that she was in love with the maid and did everything to prove her love. In her distorted narration of the events, her cruelty to the maid was not punishment, it was sexual favors."

187,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-duke-of-burgundy/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DRauchDoes2015,"Apr 25, 2015",8,"A lush, slow-burn erotic art film, The Duke of Burgundy is a hauntingly gorgeous, emotionally astute (if not exactly insightful) drama, one that solidifies Peter Strickland's place at the head of the new wave of British auteurs. His film seeps with hypnotic imagery, complimented by a pulsating, seductive score from Cat's Eyes (Strickland's replacement composer after the unfortunate death of electronic veteran Broadcast). The pacing is intentional, teasingly so, and Strickland's vintage, yet modernly sensible aesthetic is on display in it's fully realized prowess. None of this would've come across as anything more than a respectable exercise in pretentious experimentalism, however, had we not been graced by two absolutely revelatory performances from Knudsen and D'Anna. Their understated dynamic is what sells The Duke of Burgundy and what prevents it's accomplished cinematic technique from dwarfing it's thematic focus.

The most unforeseen pleasantry of The Duke of Burgundy is actually how funny it is, laugh out loud, at times. The humor is often amplified by just how muted the delivery is. The lead characters' intimate interactions are sometimes interrupted or sabotaged by mundane circumstance, often to hilarious effect. Such a scene as Evelyn urging a disgruntled Cynthia to urinate on her behind a closed door is a high-note worth mention that, in spite of sounding crude on paper, is tastefully gut-busting. Strickland, in spite of wholly committing to an approach that fluctuates between dreamy abstraction and solemn directness, never takes his material too seriously. This is a BDSM film in essence, but one pitched so perfectly that it dodges exploitation and surface-level titillation entirely, whilst not stifling indulgence in it's sensual backdrop.

The metaphorical cinematography, though occasionally obscure and isolated, generates a consistent mood of intrigue from start to finish. Though some visual cues lead to the occasional rabbit's hole, Strickland comes through for the most part and makes a movie that is discernible, yet challenging enough to warrant retrospection. From the (I swear it's in there) fuzzed-out mannequin seated in the crowd of female observers, to the ongoing display of taxidermic moths, to the numerous angles shot into mirrors, to the puzzling blur in the central relationship when the two alternate between the bedroom and reality, etc. The Duke of Burgundy is accomplished enough as an art film to the point where an air of pretentiousness is for the most part absent throughout.

Every moment is exuberantly executed by playing off of a tension of expectation. Many of the scenes don't rotate around a central mechanism of conflict. Rather, they all build to a potent, singular atmosphere that makes the most mundane interaction captivating. Though in a more wholesome sense there isn't any primary issue driving the narrative, the subtlety of the storytelling and sheer command of tone throughout makes the story feel somehow universal, and always intentional. The slick polish of the film would leave me feeling cold, but damn, do Knudsen and D'Anna manage to captivate. There is a genuine emotional undercurrent running through every second of screen time they have together, and for a story such as this, it's a testament to their incredible nuance as well as their willingness to tackle dauntingly revealing subject matter. Their romance is an alien one, true, but nonetheless believable.

There is also a commendable, and at times bizarre, subversion of societal expectations relating to gender and sexual orientation. Strickland's film is very modern in that it doesn't bat an eye at the homosexual relationship at the center of this story. It is eerie, though equally laudable, that his film also contains nary a single male character. In an age where female roles are either secondary or lackluster, here we have a cinematic universe ripe with femininity in all it's splendor. Whether this is simply unintentional or another brilliant cue from Strickland that adds to the feeling of fantasy, kudos. It's a film of entirely positive female characters, and one that humbly (or even non-existantly) asserts it's matriarchal overtones.

There comes a movie every so often that breaths fresh life into archetypes of cinema, and I'm proud to announce that The Duke of Burgundy is the first great film of 2015, and the best movie on the subject of Sadomasochism I've ever seen (sorry, Secretary). Definitely give this one a watch, it's a challenging, sublimely beautiful film."

Probably the most of any film in the last decade.  Despite the bizarre and completely unbelievable setting for Duke of Burgundy, one can imagine themselves in a relationship with different power dynamics where it is not always evident who is in control and who is more vulnerable.  Such is the case with professor Cynthia and student Evelyn.  The power dynamic is not what it seems.  The outrageously rehearsed, and mildly comical, ""BDSM"" routine these two women do is only made more entertainingly puzzling by eccentric background characters.

Shot entirely on iPhones, it dazzles with its sun-soaked, neon-tinted visuals, capturing the raw energy of Christmas Eve in Los Angeles. You’re drawn right into the world of Sin-Dee and Alexandra, two transgender sex workers navigating personal dramas with a remarkable sense of humor and resilience. Baker’s knack for humanising communities often ignored—immigrants and sex workers, in particular—shines through as he portrays their struggles with empathy and authenticity.

I can’t help but regret not seeing this before Florida Story, Red Rocket, and Anora. The thematic building blocks of those later works are all here, making Tangerine feel like an early sketch of Baker’s increasingly refined voice. It’s bursting with charm and chaotic energy but lacks the technical finesse and narrative depth of his subsequent films. Still, it’s a compelling and vital look at stories too rarely told."

I'm not necessarily talking about the transgenderism - I'm more talking about class and occupation. I don't know how people have the will to live in the environments and situations this movie depicts. The flat LA landscape. The dirty cabs. The stuffy apartments shared by a dozen literally f***ing people. Giving strangers blow jobs in cramped cars. I feel like I'd kill myself pretty quickly if I had to live like that, but the protagonists in this movie do live like that, and they do live."

Tangerine

Tangerine is a character driven feature about a girl who is looking for his boyfriend on Christmas eve. As the premise guides you, the sense of urgency is kept alive throughout by real-time tightly packed screenplay that keeps the audience on the edge of the seat. The structure might resemble a bit especially where the rudimentary process of investigation is concerned. But with Baker being on throne, his realm is unexpected and justified to the core where the audience wants to be fiddled by him. And like many of his tale, this too takes mythological tale and foliates it with his raw dark theme and bold writing skills. The background score might not be accurately edited but is surely up beating and helps elevate the momentum along with decent cinematography and fine editing. It is shot beautifully with camera work that is manually handled and brimmed with bright colors. The parallel tracks are equally gripping and exhilarating whilst demands the attention through projecting the inner world that is intriguing enough to invest in it. Chugging down the plethora of emotions that offers quite a range with the help of its multiple characters that are manipulated like a puppet. The performance isn't natural and the audience can feel it but is decent enough for it to grow on you. Baker's pocket his filled with tiny notions that offers this quirky tale an appropriate gravitas and with an execution skills like his, you won't have to check twice. The weaving of the high pitched dramatic sequences may slow things down a bit but when it finally hits on screen, it is utterly electrifying. Few one liners, pragmatic characters and aptly written conversations are the high points of the feature. Tangerine is definitely an essential feature both politically and cinematically, as it raises essential questions on society and the craft that ought to be explored."

Just one day event based theme and brilliantly made film. This film was made using iPhone 5s and this is not some film school project. The quality was really top notch, with great performances by all who involved in. I have never seen such perfectly rendered transgender story. I mean no offense, but it looked so real. Hats off to the director, writer and the actors.

Last year, there were some talks about this film's chances at the Oscars, but in the end it did not make. So after that I kind of lost interest in it, but now I had an opportunity to watch and I liked it very much. How a simple story and its simple characters developed were the highlights. You can't predict this stuff, because you won't know what comes after the each twist.

Most of the film takes place on the evening time, so that colour of the sky is what the title represents. I don't think anybody would dislike this film. It was slow, but short and sweet. One of the best films from the 2015. You much choose this to watch for its uniqueness in the filmmaking and the storytelling. In addition to that, it also entertains, so there's your reason to go for it.

In a week that also sees the releases of Michael Fassbender in 'Steve Jobs' and Dame Maggie Smith in 'Lady in a Van,' Tangerine' is far and above the best film of the three.

It is one of the most funny and original films of the year. and stars two transgender actresses in the lead roles, roles that will make them both stars.

Mya Taylor is Alexandra, and Kitana Kiki Rodriquez is Sin-Dee (yes, Sin-Dee), it's Christmas Eve in Los Angeles, and Sin-Dee has just got out of jail after spending 28 days for holding drugs for her pimp boyfriend Chester (James Ransom). She finds out, from Alexandra, that Chester has been having sex with Dinah (Mickey O'Hagan), so Sin-Dee goes on a mission to find Dinah and then to confront Chester. And Alexandra is having her own drama - she's performing at a local bar that night and has passed out fliers to everyone she knows. Meanwhile, she's got one of her regular customers, Razmik (Karren Karaguilian), looking for her. Razmik has problems of his own, he's attracted to transgender prostitutes, but he's married with a young daughter at home. He's also got his nosy mother-in-law visiting for the holidays.

Sin-Dee finds Dinah in a motel room with several other prostitutes and their naked male customers, so she literally kidnaps her and then heads to confront Chester. Alexandra, meanwhile, scuffles with a customer who doesn't feel like he should pay her because he didn't come. But she does have sex with Razmik in a brilliant uncut sex scene in a car wash. All these characters converge together at the local Donut Shop as they confront each other about infidelity in a very dramatic and hilarious ending. Tangerine is a Christmas tale not of the typical Christmas kind.

Shot on three iphone 5s' on a $105,000 budget, Tangerine is not the sort of movie you would expect to be dazzling, funny, dramatic, adventurous and original, but it is. Thanks to the many elements that bring this 88-minute film to fruition which make it so; the guerrilla style filmmaking is excellently created by Director, Editor, Co-Cinematographer and Co-Writer Sean Baker (co-written along with Chris Bergoch). And the actors are fantastic. Baker initially met Taylor at the Los Angeles Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender and **** Community Center, and she introduced him to all her friends, including Rodriquez, which is how 'Tangerine' came to be, and these two actresses more than carry the movie, they are the movie, you can't take your eyes off them. The rest of the cast is also brilliant; especially Karaguilian (who is a professional actor) brings sympathy to his role as a man trying to do the right thing but who also harbours a secret, and O'Hagan as the 'other' woman who is literally dragged around Los Angeles by Sin-Dee in the search for Chester. The Los Angeles neighborhood where this film is shot feels like another character in the film; the hued and hazzy skies, cheap motels, strange people and very cheap fast food restaurants litter the area. And the music (and script) is cutting edge; pulsating, loud, sharp, a perfect match for a film with characters who are the same, who spew lines such as 'He just went from half **** to full **** to 'You forget I've got a **** too,' and 'you don't have to Chris Brown the **** with copious amounts of the word **** and '****.' 'Tangerine is a smorgasbord of wit and sarcasm. It's also brilliant and must be seen to be believed."
212,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/tangerine/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,FilmPhonic,"Nov 22, 2015",7,"You’ll be hard-pressed to find a film which is more timely and representative of 2015 western culture than ‘Tangerine’, an urban comedy/drama indie filmed entirely on Apple iPhones, featuring a cast of transsexuals and recent immigrants, and starring two transgender women as prostitutes in a series of misadventures on the streets of L.A.

‘Tangerine’ is an unconventional and slightly tragic screwball comedy/drama where the lives of pimps, prostitutes and their clientele are uncomfortably and hilariously thrown together.

Produced by major indie players the Duplass Brothers and written/directed by indie darling Sean Baker, ‘Tangerine’ was filmed on location in a notorious Santa Monica area near Hollywood where pimps, prostitutes and drug dealers ply their trade.

By using basic and accessible technology while casting leads with “experience” in the industry and area, Baker has achieved an ultra- realist view of L.A. that’s seldom seen, and has candidly depicted a subculture that has until now been largely ignored by media, all while crafting an outrageous comedy/drama that consistently walks the line between gritty and sleazy.

Clearly inspired by guerrilla filmmaking and indie heavyweights like John Waters and Jim Jarmusch , director Sean Baker delivers a vibrant and often uncomfortable cinematic experience that’s neither judgemental or sympathetic. Despite a dysfunctional and unexpectedly touching relationship between the two central working girls, clearly reminiscent of ‘Midnight Cowboy’, none of the characters are particularly sympathetic while the men suffer a particularly savage depiction that’s a thinly veiled theme of the movie.

Despite the critical acclaim so far, ‘Tangerine’ may be a divisive film for a larger general audience who may not be ready to deal with such a bold representation of the more marginalised people in modern western society. Although the film is sequential and easy to follow, there is a lot of filler. Expect the now ubiquitous dramatic indie synth-pop and electronic music sequences, in the form of endless overly stylistic purposeful walking scenes, which when removed, would probably make ‘Tangerine’ a 40min short.

The Bottom Line…
Outrageously funny and often uncomfortable to watch if somewhat flawed, ‘Tangerine’ is groundbreaking guerrilla indie filmmaking in both narrative and production, an unflinching look at the lives of the more marginalised in modern society."

There are a few instances of amateur editing/dialogue/acting, but you get past it quickly and the overall impression you are left with is almost excellent, almost real.

I suppose you could argue there's an element of fate about it or inevitability but then people may complain that it's too simplistic to say that. I'll let the viewer come to their own conclusion - in any case, its certainly a thoughtful film, with quite good use of camerawork, to pan around the various characters, show how downtrodden their existence is and it's easy enough to imagine how disheartening it must be for them to be in that place, mentally, physically and emotionally I suppose.

The vitriol some people show towards others did seem, on one hand, believable and also, for me it was obviously quite frustrating and saddening, for obvious reasons. It's in this sense that it is certainly a thought-provoking watch.

Speaking of camerawork, I did feel there was quite a distinct sort of floaty feel or atmosphere to this film, with the viewer apparently observing the characters from multiple angles, while also glancing around at the surrounding area. Its a thought-provoking, sad (also just to note there is one scene featuring a dog being attacked and we are briefly shown a somewhat bloodied dog afterwards, which could be quite upsetting for some) but a memorable film that's well worth a watch, as long as you know it's not going to be very cheery but otherwise, I would recommend this film, yes."

I love the atmosphere of this film. It all feels wierdly familiar. I can feel the cold air. I can smell the environment. The closing scenes in particular I think will evoke an odd sense of nostalgia in a lot of people. The fact that almost every scene is shot in long takes makes it even more immersive.

It can drag quite a bit at times. With a runtine of almost four hours and a pace so slow it would make Andrei Tarkovsky jealous, it was always going to drag, but it never stops being completely entrancing and heartbreaking.

The lives portrayed are not those we should emulate. Most of the film concerns the lowest rungs of the social ladder: people not favored by nature or by nurture. Their backdrop is a bleak industrial landscape that Americans would call ""Rust Belt"". Their plans often go awry in catastrophic ways. Their relationships seem to impoverish rather than uplift them. Their language, as far as I can understand it, is simple mutterings with indistinct pronunciation and little melody. It's no wonder the director killed himself soon after finishing this film.

So why did I give this big downer a nine on a scale of ten? There is art that entertains us -- America seems to have entirely too much entertainment, to the point that entertainers' opinions are taken too seriously and some are even elected to high office. Then there is art that shows us the realities that we may not be seeing because they are too distant geographically or psycho-socially. This is one of those films. It splendidly reveals one side of modern life in China, a side that has echoes in our own past and present. This is a picture of the Americans who die from Fentanyl overdose (a drug largely supplied by China, btw). It explains why some people would rather vote for a change -- any change -- rather than continuation of the status quo, and will forgive any amount of chicanery if it makes life better on the margins.

In this crucial moment of history, when Asia and possibly the wider world are threatened with a catastrophic corona-virus pandemic that could decimate China's economy and its population (if not the world's), An Elephant Sitting Still is a poignant look at those who will surely be first to die. Mean and backwards as they seem, they should not be forgotten."

If I had to try, I would say that Elephant is a distillation of depression, with a few things added. One such thing is a an element of disgust, I'm not sure with what, perhaps the state, or perhaps the soulless grey urbanisation that is almost a character in itself. While watching the film I felt as though the director were trying to show me something (I didn't know he'd died at this point), perhaps his own vision of life in general, or perhaps a vision of certain areas of China, perhaps both.

An Elephant Sitting Still

Bo Hu, the writer and director, whose first project, this project, is an almost four hour long achievement. Now, usually, it is advised to shoot something, some short film or a video before taking on a big project like this. And he has previously worked behind the camera. But even if he hadn't, this journey of making a film like such would have taught him well. Joking aside, the film never gets to that weak point. It doesn't have any. In fact there isn't a loose thread for you to follow up to that alpha material. You can't deconstruct the engineering of this film.

The film starts from an ambiguous lost point following an equally oblivious character in each scenario. Capturing a day of these fellows' lives, the film is difficult to watch for two reasons. Don't worry they are deliberately installed to speak more expressively. First, are the characters. Each character that we come across with, is always the by product of its miserable fate. As in, it is never in control of what is to happen to him or her. Either someone knows and is keeping its mouth shut than someone can't control it.

And if some can control it, it doesn't have the authority to and if someone has the authority to, then it itself is lost, misdirected and misinterpreted. Second, the cinematography. If we are following four lives in An Elephant Sitting Still, we are literally doing that. The camera doesn't leave them at any cost. The result is a close up shots of these various incidents captured through their expressions, performances. You feel congested. You aren't able to breathe. Horrible things go down and the emotion adds more trouble for the audience. Neither meltdowns nor reserved nature gives us a shoulder to hang on to."

His incredible debut also turns out to be his epitaph. Pretty **** sad if you ask me.

It's hard to review this film because I don't even know how to describe it. In a way it feels like a Béla Tarr film where the time is passing while the camera takes it in and capturates it.

The film covers its characters in a 24-hour period and that's the interesting thing before the gloomy elements of what it portrays.
None of them is a memorable character and it's not that their lives are so flashy to be dazzled by them however you can't stop watching, because the most amazing thing about this film taking into account its lenght is that once you start, you need to know where it's going and where it will end and perhaps that's the most notable part of it, because when the time comes to the final part despite its pessimism it certainly makes you reflect a little on what it means to live day by day especially when life is not a bed of roses : Tomorrow will come, always will.
It can probably get worse or maybe things will somehow get better, because in the end that's the best thing you can hope for.

I've gotta tell you this is not an easy film. Honestly it's not. And if this style of cinema is not your thing, don't even try, but if you consider giving it a chance, then I can only tell you to be patient and be captivated."

Maybe it was from a spate of absolutely abysmal movies that were billed as ""shocking"" or ""horrifying"" or somesuch other nonsense.

Room genuinely surprised me, and in a good way.  It gets across the extreme stress and horror of Brie Larson's character without being gratuitous.  Obvious content warnings include things like involuntary imprisonment, drug use, and sexual assault, though the latter is never directly shown and is made all the more impactful for it, in my opinion.  Other tryhard directors would've gone all-in, spending minute after agonizing minute putting the repeat violation of our heroine on full, needlessly graphic display.  Abrahamson has shown that he understands the concept of less is more and that one can convey a nightmarish situation without being totally wanton about it.

This is also one of the very, VERY few movies that genuinely made me care about a child character.  Between Abrahamson's direction and Jacob Tremblay's superb talent (seriously, if the kid keeps giving performances like this, he's got one HELL of a career ahead of him), Jack is...well, he's a character.  A lot of directors just toss a child into the mix and assume you're going to care by default and forget that they need to actually BE characters.  That, or they make the kid out as being way too well-behaved, outright angelic, or intelligent for someone of their age and it kinda breaks suspension of disbelief.  I could legitimately see a kid like Jack existing.  He acts like a 5 year-old, for both good and ill.  He interacts with his mom and others like a child would, in those circumstances.

The 2nd half is also done VERY well.  The movie could've easily ended at the closing of the 1st half and nobody would've batted an eye.  It also could've easily made the 2nd ****, grimdark borefest being needlessly gritty, miserable, and depressing.  Again, nobody would've batted an eye if it'd have done that.  But, it didn't.  The 2nd half was, to put not too fine a point on it, honest.  It was sweet at times.  Harrowing, too.  Even stressful.  Again, though, all done in the right way, at the right times, and handled both maturely and realistically.

My wife and I started watching this at midnight, and neither of us so much as had a drooping eye the entire time.  Easily one of the best movies I've seen in a while.  Its emotional, its honest, and its harrowing without descending into grimdark territory or wallowing in disgusting, pointlessly graphic nonsense.

All in all, an excellent movie and well worth watching if you can handle the subject matter."

A film with a difficult subject, that is the stuff of nightmares, but tells it so beautifully with an interesting approach that works better than all the potential traps that films of its genre could fall under.

What could have easily have been told in a lurid, gratuitous way (being inspired by the true-life case of Josef Fritzl) is instead told in a careful and restrained way. There is even an innocence in 'Room', due to its very fascinating decision to tell it from the viewpoint of a five year old, in this case Jack, one that comes off very movingly and gives a sense that there is a little ray of hope in a seemingly hopeless situation. The source material, equally brilliant, is to be thanked here, its author Emily Donoghue adapts it to screen here and none of its power is lost.

Really appreciated the careful and restrained approach to the storytelling in 'Room', and for me and many others it was something different considering the subject. It does though affect some of the pacing in the middle act, where a little of the tension seen in especially the first part is lost a little.

For my tastes too, though it probably did fit the film's younger and more innocent viewpoint it's told from, the music score does lay it on too thick with the treacle.

However, loved how the story was told and its approach. What 'Room' also strongly benefitted from being told this way was that the mother and son relationship was able to shine through and really resonate, which it may not have done as effectively with a heavier tone. And shine through it does, with great charm and poignancy. Also appreciated that none of the characters were painted too black and white, even Old Nick.

Production values are effectively claustrophobic and the nocturnal parts chillingly nightmarish. 'Room' is beautifully directed by someone who understood how claustrophobic thrillers worked, how mother and son bonds do in dire situations do and the ability to combine both to ensure a powerful experience. A directing job that's both unsettling and empathetic. Similarly 'Room' is written with effortless skill and deft thoughtfulness.

Can't find anything to fault the performances. The superb one of Brie Larson, that was a very worthy Oscar (Golden Globe and Bafta too) win in her category, is an obvious starting point, but one mustn't overlook the beyond-his-years turn of young Jacob Tremblay, one of the best child acting performances in recent years, and William H Macy and Joan Allen both giving some of their best work in years. Sean Bridgers also gives much more to what could have been a standard cliché role.

Overall, great powerful film but the somewhat fascinatingly unconventional (for the genre) way the story was told won't work for some. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
236,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/room-2015/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,All_ButTrU4,"Jan 3, 2022",8,"Emma Donoghue’s screen adaptation of her own book is superior in every way to the novel which was told in a style that would not be to everyone’s taste. The story of a young woman abducted of the street and kept prisoner in a garden shed for seven years, during which time she gives birth to a son now five, could have failed on so many levels. Therefore, it is great to report that director Lenny Abrahamson has done an incredible job in finding the perfect visual style with which to tell this potentially small and insular story. In the first half he resolutely refuses to be enslaved by the claustrophobic confines of the room itself keeping the camera up close a lot of the time on the faces of his actors, trusting in their ability to keep the viewer engaged. Precise editing and interesting camera angles also help the film achieve a seamless fluidity that one never dreamed could be possible from reading the book.
The actors are outstanding. Brie Larson makes her biggest impact ever as the mother prepared to sacrifice all for her son and, as the boy, Jacob Tremblay is just magnificent. That such a mature and natural performance has been achieved by one so young is truly astonishing. It is fair to say that in lesser hands the quality of the film would have been compromised without his level of performance. The success of the film ultimately hinges on the believability of the child and young Mr Tremblay delivers in spades. Joan Allen pops up as grandma adding fireworks to one scene in particular, but William H Macy is totally wasted. The film is on occasion genuinely moving without being overly manipulative, although the lovely score does play some part in this. It is easy to see how it won the audience award at Toronto as I’m sure most people who see it will love it."

239,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/room-2015/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,FilipeNeto,"Jan 2, 2021",9,"When I didn't know if there were films that could surprise me, this film was able to do that. I believe that it is not a perfect film, there are some flaws and weaknesses in the script, if we have time to analyze it more deeply. After some reading I realized that the film is based, very vaguely, on a real situation that occurred in Austria just over fifteen years ago, and that it was a true horror film turned into reality.

The film is profound and touching in many ways. First, because it brings us a cruel history of deprivation of liberty, ****, abuse and suffering. Second, because it tells us all this from the innocent perspective of a child who has never seen the world beyond the room where he was born, and where he lives imprisoned with his mother, at the hands of a cruel man, who is also his biological father, but that the film will make clear that he is not the boy's father. And in fact, what father would deserve to be treated as such after doing something like that to a son, isn't it? The film is truly beautiful and elegant, and wonderfully harmonizes the child's perspective, who sees the world and things in his own way, and the mother's perspective, which is basically ours too, and who has a clear sense of what is happening and the drama they're experiencing.

Despite the harshness of the story told, the film never assumes itself as a thriller or a drama. In fact, there is a touch of fairy tale that greatly softens the tone and ambience. At no time did we feel truly tense, despite the situation of the characters being tense and not envisaging much success. The second half of the film is even smoother and more luminous, and shows how mother and child will try to rebuild their lives and their families after all that tragedy.

The film does not have a big cast, and the characters have plenty of time to develop and take on complex psychological nuances and contours. The most developed and interesting are clearly the Mother and her son, Jack. And Brie Larson was amazing at how she brought this desperate and brave mother to life. She was capable of one of the most breathtaking and professional dramatic and interpretive works I have seen in some time, and deserved the awards she received for this film in all fairness. Jacob Tremblay, who brought Jack to life, also deserves congratulations. Apparently, and despite his young age, he already had some experience as an actor when he made this film, but there is no doubt that we rarely see actors so young shining so completely. He did a better job than many adults would have done, I am sure of that. And the way both actors interact in front of the camera is magnificent, dignified, credible and genuine. I also really liked the work of Joan Allen and Sean Bridgers, although the film does not reveal what happens to the villain, who just disappears.

Technically, it is a superb and intelligent film. One thing that I observed carefully, and that I did not want to miss, was the quality of the dialogues, in particular Jack's monologues, in which he makes very pertinent and intelligent observations to the world around him. It is wonderful to enter the child's mind and see the world through his eyes. Cinematography is equally extraordinary, especially in the first half of the film, due to the way the camera manages to convey the feeling of being in such a limited space. The setting and the smallness of the entire physical filming space clearly helped and the construction of the whole set and costumes was also a smart bet on the part of Lenny Abrahamson, who ensured the direction of the film. It is a slow-paced film, with time for many reflections and ramblings that never seem to be too much in the film. The soundtrack is quite good, but it does not distract us from the essential, which is the story told and the relationship between that mother and her child, and between that child and the new world that opens up for her."

I saw Captain Marvel before Room and if I never saw room, I would've said Larson was a mediocre actress. Obviously that's not the case. I hope I can see her preform more like she did here in Room and not a shallow shell with no personality. Jacob Tremblay is one of the few amazing child actors I've seen currently along with Dafne Keen.

a fairy-tale about the bond between a mother and a child. ""Room"" is filled with emotions and I cried like a baby several times. Brie Larsen received Oscar for her performance in the movie (she was great), but for me - little Jacob Tremblay is the star of ""Room"". He was robbed!!! of Oscar. He should've been nominated in the ""best actor in a leading role"" category. He was so natural in the movie. The scene with his ""uncle"" Leo when they are eating cereal for breakfast and talking about dogs - I've never seen a child actor so convincing in a scene. And there were many scenes where this little boy showed his incredible talent. Emma and Lenny gave us a beautiful story out of something very dark and disturbing.

However, the only thing that made me want to keep watching was finding out why Jack and his mother were being held captive. The first two acts are the film's best points, where we are kept in suspense and emotionally invested. However, once Jack and his Mother are free, the film feels like it has nowhere else to go now that Jack has seen the outside world. I thought Jack's introduction to the outside would be a lot more drawn upon and emotional, but Jack only seems to be that way for about 10 minutes, from where the film shows the everyday life of Jack now living in the outside world. No other significant events took place, and Jack's mother's attempted suicide comes and goes, with hardly any relevance to the plot. Where Room excels is at providing amazing performances and an intense first and second act, while the rest of the film seems bloated and unnecessary.

The screenplay of this film is based on a novel by Emma Donoghue and i can confirm that it has been adapted so well by the writer of this novel.

That’s a pseudo-spoiler because it comes only a quarter of the way in, but because without that info you will until that point wonder just what the hell is going on, but because, given the relentless spoiler-rich hype that most films receive these days, you will undoubtedly know that much by the time you initiate the stream or pop the DVD into your player anyway.  The best reason for that “pseudo,” though, is that you may have already read Emma Donoghue’s novel.  For, while Donoghue has afforded this story as sympathetic a treatment as you might hope a screenwriter would for her own novel, seeing the movie is no substitute for reading the book, or, to put it another way, the book is a better book than the movie is a movie.  Naturally, Jack’s first-person voice, one of the book’s great charms, is mostly lost here (and Donoghue, probably wisely, does not attempt to reproduce it).  But beyond that, some aspects of the book that could have been reproduced here are not translated to the screen as effectively as they might have been.  Examples include the watershed scene at the halfway point, which was at once hilarious and unbearably tense in the book, or Ma’s setback in the second half.

But okay, telling people to read the book (or at least read it first) is a weasely way out of a movie review.  If the movie piques your interest and the book doesn’t, you will probably find the film an engrossing and affecting story—one that may touch you with its faith in the durability of love and the resourcefulness of the human mind and heart under outrageous stress.    Good marks to all involved."

Plus great actors are in. LOVE - the love of a mother to her child is really unconditional, unexplainable. The film proves that a mother and child relationship is as strong as mountains and like a water flows into the river, it is unstoppable. HOPE - when they are inside the room, they felt despair but not stronger as their hope to get out. Their hope helped them to live in undesirable place. BRAVERY - the film illustrates that in life, we need to risk, we need to risk even our lives are at stake. The bravery of her son set them free. FAMILY - when both of them finally get out of the room, and away from the criminal, their family is their resort, is their shield of their vulnerability. MOVING ON - at the end, when they go back again to the room they used to live, there is this tone of moving on. Moving on is a vital in the story as they live again in a normal way. Enjoy watching!

Starring Brie Larson and youngster Jacob Tremblay, 'Room' centers around a mother and son that live in a very small single room. It isn't revealed where the room actually is at first, but Joy 'Larson' is frequently visited by a man her and her son, Jack, refer to as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers). Old Nick comes to Joy seemingly for sex, and to give them small amounts of amenities at a time.

Joy reveals to Jack, after his 5th birthday, that she was taken by a man that asked for help with his dog and has been in 'room' for 7 years.

Jack has never left 'room' and has no concept of the outside world, though Joy tries her hardest to explain things. Joy tries to escape 'room', including Jack in her plans to trick Old Nick. She succeeds in faking Jack's death so Old Nick can dispose of his body, wrapping him in a rug and telling him to run once he's able to. The plan succeeds and the police eventually find and free Joy.

Joy and Jack, after being released from the hospital, go to live with Joys mother and new step-father (as her parents divorced while she was missing). Joy has trouble re acclimating with the world, going so far as to attempt suicide, while Jack, slow to take to the world at first, begins to thrive in it. Jack's strength ultimately gives Joy strength as they move on with their lives.

The story is both heartwarming and heart-breaking. Seeing how Joy and Jack had to live, being prisoners for years was awful yet inspiring to watch. Joy's love for Jack is what kept her going all along. Both actors were marvelous in this film and it is one I would recommend checking out.

266,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/room-2015/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MeritCoba,"May 2, 2016",9,"Oh yes, Room. It has great bits! They shine more than the not so great bits.

The first half of Room is no doubt the strongest part. A young woman, Ma, en her five-year old son, Jack, are locked up in a chamber with no windows, one skylight and one locked metal door. Who are they, why are they there?
The why isn't even the most interesting bit, it is how they get through the day and how they plan to get out of it.
For a moment I was confused about Jack. He looks like a she, so I figured he was actually a she, but Ma had created the pretense she was a he(are you with me?) to protect Jack, but I was a bit too fast in my thinking.
Halfway through the movie the two have escaped and somehow I got the feeling that the movie was about to wind down just to pick up again as to wind down yet again and pick up yet **** so on. There is intense moment when Ma is interviewed and asked if she shouldn't have let Jack be brought away by her captor when he was just a baby. It doesn't feel like a question, it feels like a judgement.
It is also intensely gripping how she slowly falls apart once she is actually free. A vital part of her life has been stolen from her and it rips her apart now she isn't in the room where the scope of ambition and possibilities is just to get through the day.

However there are some less shinier bits. For brevity I will discuss the most glaring one. This movie feels like there is a deeper meaning behind it all. Is the room a metaphor for life? Are we in a room without windows and the only connection to the rest of the world is a television; a one way communication device that isn't even a reliable representation of the world? The television is a place of wonder for Jack and Ma has to explain to him that some things are real(which Jack seems to find strange) and some are not(which he finds to strange as well). The world is larger than Room, but Jack has a hard time to believe it. The metaphor creeps up again when the subject of suicide crops up. Did ma not consider it? Is the Room life from which we can escape by committing suicide? Neither the metaphor nor suicide are addressed. The movie focuses on the drama.

Room is a gripping tale of a young woman and her young son in a serious predicament and its aftermath. It has two powerful acting performances by Brie Larson as Ma and Jacob Tremblay as Jack. That alone is worth a look. Any deeper meaning however seems lost in the telling of the tale, but perhaps I just missed it. But since I did I give it a eight only. Correct me if I am wrong."
267,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/room-2015/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GentM2015,"Apr 24, 2016",10,"Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamson and stars Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers, and William H. Macy.
The film is about a woman named Joy ""Ma"" Newsome who was abducted and held captive in a room for seven years, and her son, Jack who is five years old and has been living inside that particular room his entire life. The film follows their attempt at escaping from that place and as we see through Jack's eyes, his experience of the outside world for the first time in his life.
This is definitely at the top of my best movies of the year, simply because it is incredibly done and perfectly portrayed. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give some of the best performances I've ever seen in my life in any movie what so ever. The kid, Jacob, is phenomenal and surprisingly he carries it all throughout. You'd think that an amazing actress like Brie, and her character would be the center of the movie but that's actually not the case. As she says so in the movie, her kid saves her many times, and that goes to show just how different and amazingly done this movie really is.
The director (Lenny Abrahamson) also did a very good job here, as he kept us interested and entertained through the first part of the movie when they're in the room. That is really hard to do, considering that there are not much things to do or a lot of different ways to go about it but this director did it. The music composed by Stephen Rennicks is very touching and gives those very much needed and present emotional moments meaning and heart.
I think that one of the main reasons as to why this movie worked so wonderfully well was the screenplay written by the author of the original book that this movie is based upon, Emma Donoghue. More movies should take notice of this and be loyal to the main source because that's the best way to succeed at making an adaptation.

Great acting from both stars, there were some very powerful scenes that makes you thankful for the life you're living now no matter how mundane it would seem."

277,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/room-2015/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"Feb 24, 2016",9,"Discovering a whole new world beyond the 4 walls.

We all know the German folk tale 'Rupanzel', and this is a similar kind with entirely different motive. All the above it is not a fairy tale set in the medieval period, but inspired by many real events of the present era. A couple of years ago I saw a German movie called '3096 Days' based on the true story. When I heard of this movie is being made, at first obviously I remembered that title, but after seeing the poster alone convinced me not the same. Automatically the expectations rose, and now it's got the 4 Oscars nominees, including the best motion picture.

The both halves of the movie were entirely different from each other like the two sets of story, but the core of the theme remains same. The first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single room with a minimal cast. It does not go through the intro, just begins to tell the story like it's already happening and you might take a few minutes to realise the state of condition. The next half is a reaction to what happened in the previous. And again this is also an important storytelling section because like the title, it was not all about the room, but beyond that 4 walls and its roof and floor like how it affected the mother and son.

""If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.""

The movie does not talk about the crime feature at all. Not even considered to reveal behind the motive. So the other side mystery remains as it is. The whole narration was one sided, everything was seen through the eyes of a five year old boy. He begins with the line 'Once upon a time...' like a fairy tale, because it is to him and with his cute little performance along with Brie Larson's, the movie briefs their struggle for freedom.

It was a too casual opening, like nothing bad is really happening, just they're weird people or maybe agoraphobia, except they're not. You know when we say we love to be kids again to escape this complicated adult life, sometimes we won't mean it except it was a normal reaction to the situation we're in. But what if a five year old boy wants to be four again when her mother thinks its time to him know what the real world looks like. Yeah, that's a too much to take in for a young boy, but that's the best chance they had to break free from the psycho who put her mother in that room.

""When I was small, I only knew small things.
But now I'm five, I know everything.""

It was a tidy place, but the camera angles were impressive. I know it was shot in a studio with a wide open space behind the camera, but that does not the viewpoint in the actual story. When the first half ends, it is an indication of the good parts are over, at least that's what I thought of, but what came after was the unexpected expansion in narration. Usually most of the similar tales end in that part itself like for example 'Prisoners' and the rest is understandable stuff that won't be shown.

When a tale had a ending like 'happily ever after', still some people desire for it to continue a few more minutes to know how happy really they are and that's what this film's second half.  Remember, most of the similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim's family is coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor's plans and motive, and captives struggle. Like I said it was all about what a mother and her son goes through those years in captivity and after that.

There were some suspicious characters and events like I had a bad feeling over the doctor's soft talking, also the mother-son's master plan when in captive. Those are tiny diversions to viewers assume differently against where the story is heading. It is all about the mother and son's mental trauma, especially for the little boy similar to when Tarzan is in a big town for the first time leaving behind his other life. It was a perfect pace as well, neither hurried nor a slow development. The movie was a big break for many, especially for the Irish director, and Brie Larson and of course for the kid. Definitely one of the finest movie of 2015 and a must watch.

A society that has welcomed ecclesiastical discos and drive-through pastoral advice centers into its midst has also become one tinged with the faith's contemporary bureaucracy and beliefs about blasphemy. It's also one in which unbridled sexuality has been hypocritically rationalized into existence as part of its alleged sacred doctrines. But what happens when those ""values"" become toppled by unexpected and seemingly miraculous events that don't jibe with its dogma? That's what director Gabriel Mascaro's wickedly biting satire exposes, a humorous but stern cautionary tale of what can happen when religious conformity threatens to become so pervasive that it presents a clear and present danger to a nation's citizenry. As is the case with many of Mascaro's films, this offering includes a number of protracted and explicit sex sequences, so sensitive viewers be warned, but their inclusion is all part of the phony piety that goes into the rituals, practices and beliefs of a faith-based movement that essentially rings hollow and deserves to be exposed as such."
284,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dreamcatcher-2015/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DRauchDoes2015,"May 28, 2015",8,"I've seen the term 'harrowing' pop up as a frequent descriptor in many of the reviews I've read for Dreamcatcher. While it is entirely apt, I feel it may conjure the impression of a different movie, one more focused on shock-value kitchen sink melodrama. A more fitting phrase would be 'heart-wrenching'. Yes, this is a gritty, horrifying documentary. But I've yet to see another this year with such all-encompassing empathy and understanding of the human condition at it's lowest point.

There are few non-fiction works of cinema that take aim at a world so horrendous I can hardly come to terms with it's very existence. Dreamcatcher, the latest from director Kim Longinotto, takes a long hard stare at rampant prostitution and the broken women who've fallen prey to a life of addiction, desperation, and seemingly hopeless circumstances. To call it affecting would be an understatement: this movie is absolutely riveting.

The film centers around Brenda Myers-Powell, founder of the titular Dreamcatcher Foundation, an organization that seeks to help individual women escape the trappings of the sex industry. The group, whose ethos is that of mutual understanding, respect, and solidarity, fights the good fight but goes about it in a way that is wholly modern and practical.

What is most fascinating about how Brenda works to wean victims away from prostitution is how incredibly personal, natural, and blunt her interactions are. She makes it painfully clear that her life once held the same bleak visage as those she is trying to save, and that the real way to help another human being is to understand where they are in life and what aid they simultaneously need and are willing to accept. Brenda's dialogues with these women subtly hint toward the idea that the best thing for someone in a terrible place is understanding above all else. Not feigned, obligatory compassion but a real, lived-in comprehension of a shared mindset.

Numerous firsthand accounts of physical and sexual violence are detailed by former (and current) prostitutes and they are truly shocking. The film allows it's various subjects to speak freely and depict the lifestyle they've become **** into devoid of trashy sensationalism or didactic moralizing. I'd complain that the overall incessant misery becomes emotionally draining, but the stories are so brazen that they uplift for their sheer realism. You aren't being cheated or manipulated here with a false aggrandizement of squalor and hard times - these women are living in a nightmare often trivialized by stereotyping and flippant disregard. Dreamcatcher reminds us, vividly, of the humanity beneath the oppression.

It's a **** existence, no other way to phrase it.

Luckily, Brenda is here to help these women. Her job is, though certainly not thankless, an underrepresented work of social justice on the ground level. She resists the fatigue of her worn, battle-scarred, aging body and strives all hours of the day to assuage the constant suffering of those around her. She talks to women about their lives with an empathy that is marrow-deep. Her objective is always clear, but she never oversteps her bounds or forces a decision on one of her cases. Their lives are their own and Brenda acknowledges the trickiness of navigating the mentality of someone institutionalized to feed into their cesspool of grief, because she's lived it.

Dreamcatcher's greatest attribute, without discounting it's already transfixing, hypnotic look at destitution, is how it examines the mentality of those ingrained in prostitution. These stories demand to be heard, but the truly revelatory takeaway of Dreamcatcher is the humanization of the systematic victimization of people with no other alternative but to plunge further into the abyss. This is where the film transcends mere journalistic reporting and becomes an insightful, affecting work of art. Longinotto captures with unsettling lucidity the emotional realism of these circumstances, and nothing is more disquieting than when the audience is recounted stories from a former pimp himself.

I forget his name, but his speeches, elaborating on the abuse he himself endured as well as the fleshed-out, manipulative mentality he acquired in order to thrive in the pimp-game, are a thing of distressing magnetism. Dreamcatcher would have been a fine expose if it had centered solely on the female victims, but to gain access to a man willing to confess to his lifetime of odious, amorality without depicting his motivation as purely one-dimensional provides a depth of understanding that is something I've never seen before. His stories floored me, not because they were graphic, but because I could fathom his reasoning. I grew to empathize and even pity him.

Dreamcatcher left me exhausted in the best possible way. There hasn't been a film yet this year that impacted me more deeply."

289,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/krisha/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Spangle,"Nov 14, 2016",8,"It is not a surprise to me at all that Trey Edward Shults will follow up his directorial debut, Krisha, with a horror mystery film. Though a drama, I always felt that Krisha looked like a horror film in the trailer and the film itself certainly dances along those lines. For those with anxiety, Krisha is horror personified. With a sonically arresting score, Krisha is a haunting experience of a woman coming back into a family after 10 years away, only for everything to fall apart. Watching this right before the holidays (since the film occurs during a family Thanksgiving) may be a mistake, given the horror it shows.

Krisha (Krisha Fairchild) is a ""recovering"" alcoholic, who attempts to return to her family during Thanksgiving. Most importantly, she wants to reunite with her son Trey (Trey Edward Shults) and mend the bonds with the rest of her family. Unfortunately for her, things begin going awry when her drinking rears its ugly head once more and her attempt to re-enter the family fails horribly. Using an anxious score, the film places us in the head of our protagonist, which only ups the anxiety induced by the film. This is not easy watching and Shults manages to craft a drama film that really resonates with anybody from a large family environment, especially in cases when certain family members may be disconnected - for whatever reason - from everybody else.

This drama really resonates with the viewer, but is amplified by the truly terrific acting in the film. For a cast of largely non-actors and family members of Shults, Krisha is filled with terrific performances, particularly by Krisha Fairchild. Neurotic and often hard to watch in her performance and self-destruction, Fairchild manages to somehow conjure sympathy for her lost character, while also inducing rage for her. This balance is important because it is true. As a family member, it is clear her family loves her, but her actions make them often abhor her. Fairchild plays to this dichotomy by being able to turn on a dime in her performance between sympathy and self-destruction.

Yet, the score is the thing that I keep coming back to in my mind. This score is more fitting for a horror film than a drama, which is what makes it so deeply effective. In many ways, reality can be more terrifying than the mystery of the unknown. Here, Shults certainly proves this true with his score that manages to capture the nervous intensity of Krisha and the family that is worried about her re-entry. This certainly causes fear for everyone involved and the score reflects this energy with inconsistent tones and abrasive notes that course through the veins of the viewer and instills them with the same anxiety as the characters.

Often hard to watch, Krisha is a monster of a drama film with killer performances and an even better score that really drive home the family drama on-screen. Not much happens, admittedly, which limits its appeal outside more indie circles, which is unfortunate given the talent on display in this film. Shults has certainly established himself as a man to keep an eye on, especially given the talent circling his next feature, It Comes at Night."

Krisha's inability to challenge this definition of herself,  internally or otherwise,  is evidence only that she accepted her assigned identity as the  family scapegoat.  The film made clear that the character Trey was not considering a career in film.  When we ask ourselves how in real life Trey became a filmmaker,  perhaps we see that the bad actor in this film is truly Robyn, who gains a sense of superiority by cutting Trey off from his creative flow in order to prove which is the superior parent.  There was no need to throw the whole turkey out.  Unconditional regard and love for Krisha was out of the question in order to prove Robyn correct in every way.  The Trey in the film was destined for business, and not destined to create this beautiful film about the sadness of a woman's tendency to be a control freak at the expense of the child she claims to be raising with full love.  Like Solomon,  I think we can see which is the real mother through the eyes of this filmmaker.  The mother in possession has no interest in the welfare of the child, whereas Krisha seeks only that he be in touch with his creative destiny."

Beneath the ruins of an old rec center, covered by a hockey rink, lay a stash of nitrate film prints; lost relics from Hollywood’s past. In all, nearly four hundred silent films were recovered and whisked away for restoration. Dated between 1903 and 1929, they’d been largely preserved and protected by the permafrost. An honest-to-god time capsule.

Frozen Time sees opportunity in this old discovery, both to explore the past and to recognize the faded artistry of a bygone age. Using footage pulled directly from the cache, we note Dawson’s earliest days as a gold rush destination, its transformation into a small, family-oriented town with an appetite for cinema, and its gradual decline into obsolescence. Not exactly an unusual story for this region, but the top-notch presentation (all music and title cards, just like those forgotten films) and a few rich surprises make for irresistible viewing material. And the silent movie highlights, curated with a care, are something special. Absolutely mesmerizing.

Along the way, we also get a little history lesson about the nuts and bolts of film. An essential component of the larger story that explains why pictures from this era are so scarce (a jaw-dropping 75% of all silent movies are now considered lost) and how so many of them wound up stranded in the same unlikely place.

Despotismo homofóbico en Chechenia.

Extracto:

Tremendo documental de David France que nos muestra el arresgado accionar de la ONG Russian LGTB Network. Una fuerte denuncia sobre la criminal política discriminatoria y  represiva del gobierno checheno contra su población LGBTQ, en la que involucra a sus familias como agentes represivos, en un país cuyo presidente, el homófobo confeso Kadýrov, cuenta con el apoyo explícito de Putin.
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

Reseña:

Chechenia es una pequeña república de mayoría musulmana ubicada en el norte del Cáucaso que forma parte de la Federación Rusa. Su presidente, Ramzan Kadýrov, un millonario que la gobierna en forma autocrática con el franco apoyo de Putin, lleva adelante una violenta política **** y trans fóbica, apresando y torturando homosexuales varones y mujeres para que “delaten” a otros. Algunos, fueron asesinados por el gobierno -ya que no sobrevivieron a las torturas- y la mayoría son devueltos a sus familias para que “se encarguen de ellos”, es decir para que ellas mismas los asesinen. Por otro lado, son varios los denunciados por sus propias familias.

Este documental tremendo sigue la arriesgada tarea de algunos miembros de la Russian LGTB Network, una ONG (vinculada a otras del exterior) dedicada a rescatar a los homosexuales chechenos sacándolos de ese país, alojarlos en distintos refugios secretos (uno de ellos en Moscú) y gestionar su emigración a países que los acojan en calidad de refugiados. Los casos abordados son principalmente dos: uno de un ruso que hizo una visita ocasional a Grozni, la capital chechena y fue apresado y torturado y otro de una chica chechena lesbiana extorsionada por su tío.

Aclaremos que la misma Rusia no constituye tampoco un refugio seguro para los homosexuales rescatados.

Para preservar la identidad de los refugiados, sus familias y parejas, el documental recurre a la técnica de deepfake, donde la cara y la voz de algunos de ellos son reemplazadas digitalmente por caras y voces de actores. Observamos como es la vida cotidiana en los refugios, conmovedoras escenas familiares y, en muchos momentos, el relato se tensa con escenas dignas de una película de espionaje. Se insertan además durísimos videos de apresamientos y abusos de las fuerzas policiales chechenas interceptados por la ONG.


Homophobic despotism in Chechnya.

Abstract:

Tremendous documentary by David France that shows us the actions of the NGO Russian LGTB Network.

A strong complaint about the discriminatory, repressive and criminal policy of the Chechen government against its LGBTQ population, involving their families as repressive agents, in a country whose president, the confessed homophobe Kadyrov, has the explicit support of Putin.
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… …………………………………

Review:

Chechnya is a small, Muslim-majority republic located in the North Caucasus that is part of the Russian Federation. Its president, Ramzan Kadyrov, a millionaire who governs it in an autocratic way with the frank support of Putin, carries out a violent **** and transphobic policy, imprisoning and torturing homosexual men and women so that they “expose” others. Some were assassinated by the government - since they did not survive the torture - and most are returned to their families so that they ""take care of them"", that is, for them to kill them themselves. On the other hand, there are several denounced by their own families.

This tremendous documentary follows the risky task of some members of the Russian LGTB Network, an NGO (linked to others from abroad) dedicated to rescuing Chechen homosexuals by surreptitiously removing them from that country, housing them in different secret shelters (one of them in Moscow) and manage their emigration to countries that host them as refugees. The cases dealt with are mainly two: one of a Russian who made an occasional visit to Grozny, the Chechen capital and was arrested and tortured, and another of a lesbian Chechen girl extorted by her uncle.

Let us clarify that Russia itself is not a safe haven for rescued homosexuals either.

To preserve the identity of the refugees, their families and partners, the documentary uses the deepfake technique, where the face and voice of some of them are digitally replaced by the faces and voices of actors.

We observe what daily life is like in the shelters, moving family scenes and, in many moments, the story is tense with scenes worthy of a spy movie. In addition, very harsh videos of arrests and abuses by the Chechen police forces intercepted by the NGO are inserted."

306,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/welcome-to-chechnya/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TheRaggedFlygon,"Jul 2, 2020",8,"Welcome to Chechnya is a harrowing documentary concerning a network of LGBTQ+ activists who make it their mission to help **** refugees from the Russian republic of Chechnya escape the grasps of a regime hell bent on cleansing individuals who do not identify as heterosexual from the Chechen population. The film utilizes CGI distortion to alter the appearance of many of the refugees out of the interest for their safety as many of them continue to be hunted by authorities. As one may expect the messages of this film are extremely inspiring and brave, but at the same time, the content of the film is equally gruesome and terrifying. Rather than focus on the actions taken by the Chechen government, as well as the Russian Federal Government under Vladimir Putin, the film instead focuses on the individual stories of refugees and those who aid them throughout their journey, resulting in a much more personal feel. Rather than feeling like an elongated news story, Welcome to Chechnya instead feels like a series of personal narratives. This complements the gruesome nature of the content of this documentary as you see the victims tell their stories with them facing the camera rather than a filmmaker simply commentating over news footage.

All in all, Welcome to Chechnya is an extremely powerful film that serves as a stern reminder how far some regions of the world still have to come with regards to LGBTQ+ rights and in addition how the world as a whole needs to be more supportive of the assistance of these refugees who are running for their lives."

Let’s explain to those who don’t understand again, in areas such as Chechnya, very little depends on the pride, in the form of Russian Putin, it looks like Hong Kong. They have their own laws, they also hate Russians in Chechnya, they drove a lot of people from their territory, where they originally lived with very large generations like mestizos. Many Hrestians, atheists, and other people, especially people living in cities such as Sochi, etc., that is, being the peoples of the aremenia, do not agree with them. But unfortunately, nothing can be done about it, the war with Chechnya has already ended with many deaths, so many relatives of my mother and her friends, cruelty has developed there, but this is not the only place in the world with such cruelty (and this could be clarified in the film )
Well, it looks amusing that HBO does not make films about the genocide of the same Armenians, the murder of gays in Arab countries. but at the same time everyone is stamping films about hatred and bad Russians.
As raising a topic this is good, but as a duplicity of hbo this is a typical example.
Where, by the way, is there a film about the genocide of Russians who originally lived on the territory of Chechnya or films about the poor soldiers who were tortured there? All is well, but in moderation. Also, a very big topic has not been revealed that many politically unnecessary people were tortured under these persecutions. I’ll show the film again not bad, but everyone who watches it should not forget that not only orientation affects Chechens. Even far from Chechnya, many of them impose their hatred culture in Russian cities"

The Red Turtle retains an essence of both parents: Ghibli's well-known inspection and celebration of small detail, plus the director's rich inward gaze and underlying acceptance of both the sweet and the bittersweet in life.

Our story tracks the fortunes of a castaway, trapped upon a remote island with enough native food to survive but nothing, save a family of crabs, for companionship. He settles and manages to make an unhappy life for himself until the arrival **** red sea turtle leads to a sort of dreamlike reverie that lasts the rest of his days.

Lovely visual touches reinforce that sense of the ethereal, with a wide palette of shifting colors giving each scene a distinct character. We innately understand the passage of time through such subtle changes, almost as much as we see it upon the bodies of our small cast. It could be called artsy - the slow pace and complete lack of dialog would be enough to merit that backhanded description - so if that variety of film turns you off, look elsewhere. There's an ongoing storyline, but it's rather limited and sluggish. The real riches lie in the expert craftsmanship and the warm, almost fable-like, sense of fulfillment and acceptance of what life is willing to give us."

The silence, or lack of ongoing character dialogue, somehow relaxed me more.

It has no dialogue, yet you get so much from the characters and the story. If this was in charge of a less talented crew, this movie would have a lot of dialogue, exposition and unnecessary humor. We don't have any of that because it's not necessary! I found brilliant the fact that they managed to craft an engaging and powerful story with no words. The characters have no names (**** it really necessary?) And yet they became memorable characters, not only because of their design but because we are shown their motivations and personalities just with visuals. I like the fact that the movie isn't surface level...Well, it can be if you just watch the movie without thinking about anything deeper but so many things are left up to interpretation. The score is beautfiul and helps make the story to be even more powerful. The animation is amazing and the movie looks beautiful. It looks that a lot of effort was put in the colors and design of every frame of the movie and I love that.

I get that the movie can be loved or hated because it's not a conventional film. It has so much personality and uniqueness that if you expect a straight-forward emotional story with deep dialogue, you might end up hating it, because this isn't anything like that. Sure if I start to tell the story out loud it might sound like a boring movie, but there are so many things that really help a story that, on paper, sounds boring. This is an example of how a ""boring"" story can be turned into something wonderful.

This is an amazing movie and I highly recommend it."

The film doesn't find a way of making this old truth newly profound again with its beautiful images -- they're rapturous but maybe too often in an appreciative way instead of an emotional way.

Since the Hollywood upgraded to the 3D animation, the rest of the world took over and given some incredible films in the last one and half decades. The Japanese animes are undoubtedly the best, but the European animation, particularly the 2D animation started to boom in the recent times with special mention goes to Tomm Moore. So basically I might miss some Hollywood animations, right now, but I'm very watchful over this kind of films. That's how I watched it, but anyway I would have seen it.

This is the director's first feature animation film, but he was known for his awesome short animations which one of them won him an Oscar. It was jointly produced by three countries, including Japan's Studio Ghibli. It's their first non-Japanese production and a great beginning and timing to expand the production in other continents. Especially after their legend, Hayao Miyazaki retired from the filmmaking.

The film was short like the 80 minute stretch without a single word spoken in its entire narration. There's no even sign language used, everything's actions and reactions. So you would find empty in the film's cast section which is kind of weird. I mean there are characters in the film, but all were imaginations without names and what year it takes place, where with so many questions like that. Basically to say, a film without the cast, but the crew members managed to give the best to the viewers to get it without any struggle.

One thing is for sure, that the film is very enjoyable. It is a fantasy film, so whatever you see, you have to accept it. Because that's how things happen in a theme like this, all fictional. Though, the first thing you have to keep in your mind is not the entire film was an hallucination event. There are some dreamy events and that's fine since the film character is coping with loneliness.

A man who had lost at sea, wakes up in a small island. It's a life supporting land mass with fresh water and fruits, but he also has to put some effort for fishing. His notion is to leave the island as soon as possible to go back to where he had come from, the civilised world. In his every attempt to sail with a raft he had made using bamboos, fails to cross after a certain stretch of the island coast. He later comes to know what stopped him and with an anger reaction he commits a mistake. So now he has to come out of the guilt and to do that he chooses what seems the right.

It was like a simple story without any meaning about everything that's shown in it. So in my entire watch I thought the same and said it was an okay film with great animation. But the ending changed my stance. That twist, I don't think everybody would understand. But one thing I want to make sure if you yet to see it, that it was about the purpose. The man always looks for a reason to do things and even to live or die. That's where the red turtle comes in.

Although my biggest question is, is this film a follow-up or in any way connected to the director's previous short animation 'Father and Daughter'? Because it seems the man who got lost in the sea is from that short film. But it never revealed the reason why he was stopped by whomever from return home. Also, both the conclusions syncs. It's just a my theory, so only the director can explain that.

I'm very sure this film is in the Oscars race. If it fails to make, then its not my prediction was wrong, but the Academy Awards people got it all wrong. I'm also sure it won't win as 3D animation dominated world, particularly 'Zootopia' 'Finding Dory' and 'Moana' are taking the first three frontrunner spots. Except the technical differences, only the grown ups can say this one has a better and meaningful story. It is very similar to 'Ponyo', but a grown-up's version. Anyway, it is a must see film, especially the adults and in particular those who always think animation is for children. If they see it, they might change their mind. Highly recommended!

325,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-red-turtle/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,madmovieman,"Nov 29, 2016",7,"The first thing to note about this film is that there’s no dialogue. At all. Sometimes, that can make for a dull watch, but if everything is put together as well as it can be, then this genre of film can be one of the most **** and poetic of all. The Red Turtle isn’t necessarily the most stunning film of all time, but it’s an impressive watch throughout, effectively forgoing dialogue yet retaining an engaging story, complemented by dazzling backdrops and a great score.

Before I get into what was really good about this film, I want to talk about the first twenty minutes. I think the best way to approach this film is only knowing it has no dialogue, because the way the story develops is actually very unpredictable. That being said, the opening act, where we see the castaway first stranded on the island and attempting to make an escape, isn’t quite so engrossing.

Although there are still some absolutely beautiful shots of the landscape, everything feels a lot more stagnant than it should do. The man’s eventual encounter with the red turtle doesn’t pack the punch the film is going for, whilst the experience of watching the dialogue-less film isn’t enhanced by the score, which really doesn’t pick up for a long time into this movie.

Unfortunately, the disappointing opening act meant I had a lower impression of the movie going into the latter stages, however it’s safe to say that everything really picks up as the film moves along. Again, there are some really surprising plot twists throughout the film, so I’ll try my best to avoid spoilers, but I can still talk about the way that director Michael Dudok de Wit’s incredible style plays such a role in the second and third acts.

As the story introduces a more personal and emotional note to the man’s isolation, everything becomes a lot more poetic. The first act was almost completely devoid of pure drama, but as the film unfolds, there are numerous heartbreaking and heartfelt moments alike that pull you into the story, largely because of the way the score and the visuals come into play.

Following the first act, the music becomes a lot louder, more powerful and far more emotional, but all for the better. Everything has a much greater sense of dramatic importance, and in tandem with some of de Wit’s truly astonishing panoramas of the beautiful night sky and sea, the film effectively takes on the form of a painting.

Although it does unfortunately drop off a little in the final act, and the final twist isn’t quite so impressive to see, the biggest triumph of The Red Turtle is its ability to create an engrossing and at times truly beautiful experience without the need for any dialogue or exposition. It’s not an all-time classic in my view, and doesn’t stand up to most solo Studio Ghibli productions, but it’s a different and wonderful watch nonetheless."

There's nearly an hour build up to that point and during that time, We see how deeply neglectful the parents are and how their hatred of each other and of themselves are so viciously toxic and blinding that they can't seem to focus on anything else. Even with their professional and personal lives moving on, It seems like every move made is to spite the other. And the fact that their son is genuinely missing, and possibly dead, doesn't really seem to hit them until the very end of the movie.

And then comes the worst part. There is no redemption, No realizing the errors of their ways. The parents, if anything, are worst off than what they were before their son went missing (as shown in a fast-forward that takes place 3 years later).

Undoubtedly there is hatred, disgust, indifference, selfishness, apathy, contempt, disaffection, coldness, annoyance and eventually oblivion and everything involves adults, people who are supposed to be acting with at least some trace of maturity.

But as the film makes clear, the two people involved as parents hated each other so much they sought to follow different paths and on the way they forgot the most defenseless and least guilty person and in my opinion the one who ended up paying the highest price.

Dark, provocative, it doesn't have a happy ending, this is not a happy film in any sense and maybe some people will find it oppressive but it is an excellent film, beautifully filmed and even though in some moments I wasn't very happy with the rhythm of the narrative the story is so absorbing for you to skip that detail.

One too many scenes with a cell phone, have one scene with seeing snow through a window, have 3 more, be sure many scenes run 30 seconds to 2 minutes too long and throw in a few that do nothing but extend the movie's running time and take away from the drama unfolding on the screen.

Necessary scenes at the beginning set up what takes place later. We meet 12-year-old Alexey (Matvey Novikov) as he overhears his soon to be divorced parents arguing and neither wanting custody of him. They are trying to sell their apartment. His father, Boris, (Aleksey Rozin) is a middle management desk salesman who works where divorce is a sin and could cost him his job. Meanwhile, he is living with his new, now pregnant, girlfriend, Marsha (Marina Vasilyeva) in her mother's home. Alexey's mother, Zhenya, (Maryana Spivak) owns a beauty salon and spends many hours with her new lover, Anton, (Andris Keishs), who, by the way, has a home I would love to live in! She is also strongly attached to her cell phone as both the director and cinematographer constantly, needlessly, show us her using it.

After all this is established we understand Alexey disappearing and his parents not even knowing it until his teacher calls to ask why he hasn't been in school for 2 days. The film then turns into the search for the boy, mainly by civilian volunteers as it seems the police have neither the men, the money or the time to search for all the kids missing.

The search, led by Ivan (Alesky Fateev), takes up the major part of the film with, once again, too many long and repetitive scenes that undermines the suspense. There are many detours from the main story such as meeting Zhenya's mother (Nataliya Potapova) Marsha's mother (Anna Gulyarenko) plus a co-worker (Roman Madyanov) but we are always taken back to the search of the forests, buildings, rivers and surroundings. We are given a thorough lesson in what is involved in a search for a kid who may have run away or been kidnapped or met some disaster that no parent wants to face.

The basic premises of the marriage and the search for the disappearing boy are what makes the movie so interesting but there are one too many cell phone scenes--yes we get it that Russians are as tied to them as Americans and other countries are--snow scenes and, yes, too many sex scenes!

There is a lot of politics in the movie including the USA election in 2012 but the last shot of Zhenya jogging on a treadmill wearing a red sweatsuit emblazed with RUSSIA across the front went right over my head if it means anything.

""Loveless"" will be an excellent movie when you can fast-forward the repetitive scenes and photography and slow it down each time--and there are many, yes, even too many---Anton's house is shown."

The pacing is a bit slow at times, and some of the cultural references are likely lost on non-Russian audiences. But the overall message is clear and undeniable -- and not limited to the film's country of origin."
340,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/loveless-2017/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,netflic,"Mar 2, 2018",10,"This is the latest drama from famed Russian director Zvyagintsev.

The plot is relatively simple: a divorcing couple decides to start their own lives anew.
Neither the father nor the mother plan to include their only 12-year old son onto their future lives. He finds our that his destiny is a boarding school and decides to disappear.

Through this personal story Zvyagintsev managed to show that the the whole governing structure of society is deeply sick. It produces parents who lack inner kindness, and it becomes hereditary. They do not have feelings toward each other and toward their children, and their children fall into the same trap.

A group of volunteers who keep looking for the boy after police refused to do it, is shown as competent, compassionate people, so drastically different from police.

Last scene where the mother trains in Russian Olympian uniform is symbolic of modern Russia that is cold, harsh, devastating, loveless.

It starts at the top with Russia's foreign policy and descends all the way through to citizens' lives.

Similar to his previous film ""Leviathan"", this film is a verdict to the regime but on a very different level yet done as masterfully.

With this film Andrey Zvyagintsev once again proved that he is the best contemporary Russian film director.

Must See."

It is wildly thought-provoking, and very well-acted (I'm sorry but the sex scenes had me clutching my screen! and the yelling and arguing scenes? same). The film exploits many aspects of the Russian life, through photography and cinematography that are absolutely astonishing (the first 3 minutes of the film are an utter eye-treat, for example). Moody and exhilarating, the film proves to be an explosive piece of art. A must-watch for all the cinema geeks out there."

It starts off on an amusing enough note as the crew of a low-budget production are attacked by the very same monsters found in their script and are thrust into danger by their unhinged director. It's not bad, but the zombie action is kind of weak and there are a lot of odd moments that don't make sense until much later on in the running-time. So it's not until the second portion when the curtain is pulled back on a huge unexpected twist and it completely changes its entire game (while still remaining true to the mise en abyme concept), essentially giving us two movies in one, that I began to understand why this has received so much praise. As weird as it feels to say, things are better off without the undead.

After One Cut goes in a wholly different direction we get a much funnier tale that can be surprisingly heartwarming. What we just saw beforehand is not simply abandoned however. Rather, it's built on, enriched, and made deeper. A lot of its more questionable aspects you will have noticed are explained, adding a lot of value to a rewatch of that first segment. In the end there aren't two disparate halves here, but rather a pair of distinctive, yet similar pieces that need each other to work.

Enjoyable as it all may be though, most of the hype is coming from its novelty more so than the actual content which is merely solid. There are some good jokes, but it's never a laugh riot and while I do think it's sweet with a good heart I wasn't invested in the characters. At the same time, I haven't seen anything that's executed its ideas quite like this has and in an era where originality is harder than it should be to come by that makes the experience quite refreshing, so I understand why there are so many overstatements about its quality. Particularly given its charming attitude. This is probably the cutest thing on Shudder after all."

One Cut Of The Dead

The screenwriter and the director Shinichiro Ueda has made a wrong film. It is not odd, but wrong. A film like this should never succeed. It shouldn't even work. And yet against all odds. All methods. Procedures. Years of experience. History, to learn from. Inspire form. It is a beautiful film. Guillermo del Toro says that within the first ten minutes of the film, you can tell how the film is. And it is rare for a film then to change your mind. And this happens in here. But that was planned. The film is structured in a way to throw you off the hook.

So when the time comes to grab you with both of its hands, the film never leaves you and your sight. And the makers does this by keeping an audience member, even us, at certain moments, in that shot. We are the uncredited character. And the most valuable one. If the first act, the One Cut Of The Dead, that first shot keeps us behind the camera, in front of the screen, where we are now, the fourth wall then breaks down as we start exploring the ""making"" of that act.

And by then, a character is tagged for enacting like the audience, and his or her reaction is captured perpetually and shown to us. It may even drive your feelings as how you might take that scene. And it is satisfying for these characters to hold the film together- both the one in the film and the one itself- convincing us to participate and enjoy. And this is an important fabric of the storyline. For the last shot of the film is them taking a sigh of relief from working hard. That relaxation isn't something you can achieve, if you don't care for them or if you have not invested in the process."

( 83/100 )

No conozco la espectacular historia criminal de mi país y aunque tengo una noción de la situación actual de los escándalos criminales internos de México, no me atrevería a opinar fuera de mi postura de consulta y curiosidad. Museo le da un recuento a aquellos que lo vivieron y quienes no, sobre uno de esos escándalos: En 1985 hubo un saqueo al Museo Nacional De Antropología en donde los ladrones extrajeron alrededor de 140 piezas invaluables de la cultura de Mesoamérica y en Museo, de Alonso Ruizpalacios, viajamos por México junto a la joyas para explorar un tiempo y un espacio mexicano no tan distante y al mismo tiempo muy diferente.
Gael García Bernal y su fiel Sancho Panza, Leonardo Ortizgris, protagonizan esta aventura de saqueo y reencuentro cultural. La película tiene el ingenio para presentar el México de los 80s al llenar las escenas de detalles que conmemoran la estructura social mexicana de esa época con los electrodomésticos, la moda, la estética, la ambientación, la tensión socio-política y, en cierta medida, la influencia de los medios masivos. Ruizpalacios también nos muestra el panorama natural de éste país al dejarnos ver tanto la metrópolis urbana como rural. La fotografía, en ese aspecto, tiene éxito en presentar y, junto a la música de Tomás Barreiro, resaltar la belleza estructural de todo lugar al que vamos. El dúo logra una química algo disfuncional que le permitirá a la película presentar a nuestro héroe con un antagonismo qué creará tensión entre ellos y en varias situaciones. Lo mejor es que el público podrá verlas con el gusto de tener a un actor que no solo sepa apropiarse de las situaciones, sino que le exija al elenco mexicano que lo rodea el mismo impulso. Por lo tanto, el drama y la comedia serán niveladas por la impulsividad del personaje y el carisma del actor para lograr una justa dimensión de reacciones en la película.
Ruizpalacios me sorprendió con la grandilocuencia que logra en Museo y genera una series de discursos que vale mucho la pena ver, pues nos da la oportunidad de encariñarnos con nuestra herencia cultural y, al mismo tiempo, nos implanta el valor de la duda como un aspecto esencial para evaluarlo a todo.
Todos somos ladrones, saqueamos las tumbas y las herencias de nuestros antepasados para darles el valor que interpretamos, pero realmente no nos pertenece y nadie sabe cual es su valor, más que su creador, y a veces, ni ellos lo saben. ¿Qué tan importante es una cultura para preservarla? ¿Quien decide qué es importante y qué no? y ¿Qué tanta importancia le agrega uno a las cosas? son los pensamientos que nos llevan a reflexionar en la importancia de uno mismo y en lo invaluable de la vida cultural: tan cara que no se puede cobrar. ""No hay preservación sin saqueo"".
Ruizpalacios ganó, junta a Manuel Alcalá, el Silver Berlin Bear como Best Screenplay en el Berlin International Film Festival de éste año. Ese premio definitivamente lo coloca como uno de los directores emergentes con más relevancia del país que impulsará la siguiente generación de proyectos mexicanos a ser inspiracional."

Immigrants as shadows or ghosts. Alleys that look like war trenches and houses that feel like bunkers. Pedro Costa represents poverty and misery as an open prison, one in which the prisoners' only purpose is to die.

In the film, a Cape Verdean woman travels to Portugal to meet his husband after 40 years. As she arrives, she learns of his passing, but also of his secret criminal life.

'Vitalina Varela' is striking in every sense. Never has a film shot in such low light revealed so much. Pedro Costa's latest is a harsh experience that stages a very grim scenario to effectively portray the desolation of those who, in search of a better life, find exactly the opposite."

To be frank, in the beginning I didn't know what to expect from this non-blockbuster movie. I watched the trailer, read some reviews and was looking forward to see how this movie would surprise me (since it impressed so many people - imdb, rottentomatoes, metacritic).
The combination of real life events and how they occur in movies is really something hard to master. Michael Showalter did just that...
The actors were amazing, the story was amazing, and there was a more than captivating energy based on a balance between comedy and drama that really gave me the chills (in some moments) while also keeping me on the edge of my seat.
By the end of the movie I am pleased to say that it more than fascinated / intrigued me on multiple levels and I am pleased about it being considered for multiple Oscar nominations.

Not only does it discuss a `forbidden` inter-racial relationship, but it also focuses on the relationship between the boyfriend and his girlfriend's parents, rather than with the girlfriend herself, and that's new and original. The characters are very lovable (Emily's parents are my absolute favorites, I loved them), and the humor makes you giggle all while staying so simple and charmingly-effortless. The two-hours length is surprisingly well-fitting, for the film was made to entertain during each second of them. Truly a heartfelt and emotional film, it is definitely a must-see!"
388,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-big-sick/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TrevorsView,"Oct 20, 2017",7,"Carol Burnett once said, “comedy is tragedy plus time,” a theory that gladly speaks for itself in the personal testimony written and starred by Kumail Nanjiani in his cinematic standup performance: The Big Sick.

Everything Kumail narrates about his background resembles a comedy show’s beats: first, he briefly tells about his history with a grainy yellow-tinted film reel of Pakistan accompanied by his childhood photos; then, he goes through the highs and lows of his new romance with Emily, the White woman he falls for after she shouts at him from inside the audience. He helps us listeners to emphasize with his memories by showing their first awkward talk about high school embarrassments. Their secretive dates begin with her positioned in the car’s backseat and end with an awkward hug, their conversations intimate enough to place you in the moment. She is divorced, he is forced by his parents into meeting other potential wives from his home country, and his passive acceptance of the family standard hurts her. Unfortunately, he gets no chance to apologize to her, since a possibly fatal disease puts her into a coma.

Therefore, this movie resembles a drama more closely than a comedy, because we experience the moment how it felt to him, minus time.

Alongside the key story, Kumail also strives to teach us more about Paki culture, only after he openly mocks his family’s expectations to worship Allah. Other minor quirks of a standup routine are spiced in for extra flavor in the atmosphere: he laughs, he cries, racist comments are thrown at him, and we even hear his other comedian friends tell their catastrophic backstories, plus time.

Under the wrong hands, Kumail’s story would have fallen into a schmaltzy, predictable rom-com trap. But nope, you continue to guess whether the two end up together. Some little visual stimulators make you want to see good bloom out of the turmoil, such as Kumail listening to every voicemail Emily sent him.

Instead of resorting to attractive A-listers for the leads, the casting director got whoever best fit the requirements to play the roles, and thankfully the casting director had good taste. Kumail deserves more attention after his acting endeavor, as even something non-story related like him losing his cool over a fast food order communicates his inner condition. Everyone else gives fantastic performances too, expressing distinct reactions to Emily’s predicament as the walls close in on them. Although the most real performance was Holly Hunter, who played Emily’s mother; she does not play a stereotypically frustrated old woman, but displays an even balance between happy and sad moments. Expect to see her name in the Oscar lineup come January.

Just don’t expect to see any awards in the technical categories. The clearly low budget was no problem itself, except minimal effort exploited the minimal resources to generate any stunning visuals besides plain white, apart from the orange Paki home. The lack of artistic care made this look like every other rom-com out there, yet the enjoyment remains intact.

However, the jarring editing work might interfere with the enjoyment. The editor, Robert Nassau, rarely kept the actors’ positions consistent between shots, several of which ran too short to support the mood consistency. The sound editors deserve some blame to share too, for the voices talk over each other too much during conversations that were not meant to sound heated.

You may notice several other bothersome issues; it could be the standard, unromantic musical score by Michael Andrews (Donnie Darko), or the way it stereotypes fraternity boys, but perfection still drifts a long way from shore.

Although that matters little—I applaud Kumail Nanjiani for bravely sharing the most difficult period of his life with all of us. Based on my personal experience, the best stories come from real life, so we each should see The Big Sick to learn more about the meaning of love. Especially if you’re unsure about your role in the American dream, I for one recommend taking your significant other to hear a remarkable testimony by a greatly valiant soul."

I understand this movie could be a culture shock to American, European or Australian, but to asian, it was the norm back in a 100 years time. Parents would arrange marriage and apply family pressure to their kids. In addition, the pressure about career for asian is probably no less than Kumail in the movie, and it is not even funny and I am still a disgrace to my family in terms of career choice.
I do agree the view from Kumail about how their people behave as where they are from instead of being American, which is a rare opinion. As a Chinese in Australia, I have seen 99% of Chinese would hang our with Chinese in China town, talk Chinese, eat Chinese food. And they would never interact with the local community at all. Some of them would have never watched a T20 or football game despite they live in Australia for more than 10 or so years. I try hard to be part of the community, and tbh it is not as difficult in Australia because the Aussie are generally not racist. I get most of the jokes, and they are not as funny, whereas I find the situation / interaction between people is funnier. I would recommend you to watch it."

392,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-big-sick/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,AwesomeArnoldK,"Sep 16, 2017",9,"“The Big Sick” at its core is a conventional romantic dramedy that has a relatively predictable story, but with a brilliant screenplay and refreshing execution, it excels and becomes something truly special. The characters and story are endearing because you can sense the thought and care that went into telling this really personal story. While having so much heart, the film is also incredibly funny and relatable. The screenplay is filled with humor that tackles subjects of interracial relationships, cultural differences, forgiveness, family, and love. Nothing feels heavy handed or forced to get a point across. Instead the movie prefers to observational and poke fun at the everyday things even being near death. I like how the movie is consistently funny and manages to still be heartfelt and sincere. And the screenplay really does balance everything. It’s insightful and has a positive message about time healing all wounds and family will stick together, even if they don’t see eye to all the time.

The cast is spot on and everyone gives a relatively enjoyable and poignant performance. Kumail Nanjiani, as the lead, actually gives a performance that’s comedically well timed and with dramatic depth. He really holds the screen and we care for his struggle. Zoe Kazan, as Emily and the love interest, is engaging and has a bubbly personality that’s enjoyable to watch. Kumail and Emily’s relationship is commendable as it feels natural and well developed. I honestly cared for their relationship and their on screen chemistry felt very real. Holly Hunter, Emily’s mom, is a true acting force. She really cares about her daughter without being overbearing, but instead incredibly understanding. Ray Romano, as Emily’s dad, also has some awesome scenes. He gets some of the biggest laughs, but his character is much more than a conventional comic relief. He has backstory and scene stealing moments that are equally emotional and hilarious. Honestly, I like how real and likable all these characters are and they don’t come off as jerks for the sake of having more conflict in the movie. Overall, “The Big Sick” is a romantic dramedy that isn’t the most original thing out there, but it’s funny, fresh, clever and heartfelt without being sappy and cliche in its execution. Brilliant screenplay about family, forgiveness, and love that has impeccable comedic timing. The cast is great as well. They deliver a balanced performance that’s both hilarious and heartfelt. One of the best movies of the year 4.5/5"

It rises above and beyond the boring and generic rom-coms that we’re subjected to year in year out. Powerful, heart-warming and highly emotional.
Based on the real life relationship between Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon. From the moment their relationship blossoms to the difficulties arising from their contrasting families you can’t help but become fully invested in this story. The chemistry between the two main characters is electric. Although it drags a little in the middle and I don’t know what they were thinking when they came up with the title I loved The Big Sick. It’s got drama, romance, plenty of awkwardly comedic moments and if it could melt my cold heart then there’s no reason why you shouldn’t see it. Highly recommended."

There were maybe a couple laugh out loud moments but surely you would get a lot more laughs if you just went to an average comedy. Regardless this is a good movie. Coming from someone who hates romance films, this film got it right. It was a lot different from many other romance films you'll see. If anything this is more of a romantic drama than a rom-com. The film does a great job setting up the familial relationships between it's two main characters and in fact this is more of the focus than their romance. I can see how some could fault the movie for this, but it is through these familial relationships that both the audience and the main character come to understand the relationship. Kumail (the lead) comes to understand that the problems in his Pakistani family and his cultures views on marriage are not just a product of his culture, but exist in the american culture of his girlfriend. And through this he learns that he can either choose to be like the hard but rewarding relationship like his girlfriend's parents, or he can settle into a safe marriage like his brother. The film is not saying that one is better than the other, but Kumail himself has a speech about how he needs to do things his own way. Normally I don't like this PC we are all not so different stuff. But for some reason I found the message this time oddly refreshing. My only main complaint for this movie is the frat boy scene in the comedy club. That scene felt very out of place and over done. Regardless this is clearly one of the best films out right now."

They definitely have a spark between them, but love is not always easy, as they find out.

412,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-big-sick/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,KeithDow,"Jul 13, 2017",7,"There’s a lot to root for in ‘The Big Sick.’  Not a lot of small budget romance-drama-comedies (romdramadies?) receive such publicity or praise this time of year.

The film premiered at Sundance and started a bidding war for the distribution rights between Sony, Focus Features, Amazon, and Netflix, which certainly must have made the producers feel like the pretty girl at the prom (Amazon ultimately won with a $12 million bid).

Co-creator, co-producer, co-writer, and co-star Kumail “Coco” Nanjiani—along with the rest of the cast—turn in great performances.  Considering the story is based on Nanjiani’s real-life dating experiences and subsequent marriage, it should come as no surprise that he delivers a heartfelt, authentic turn as a young immigrant looking to break free from the bonds of tradition.

Unfortunately, there are just too many times when the plot veers into unrealistic territory.  For example, what parents would visit a comedy club while their daughter is in a coma, especially with surgery scheduled for the next day?  None that I know.  Furthermore, the writing just isn’t as funny or witty or incisive as all the mid-summer hype might suggest.  However, there are times when the film feels like a refreshing respite amongst all the super-budget action flicks currently flooding local cinemas.  And, if nothing else, it’s a good movie to support for those who want to send a message to Hollywood that they need a greater emphasis on making original, auteur-driven films."
413,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-big-sick/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Spangle,"Jul 8, 2017",8,"In writing, it is said that it is best to write what you know. That way, you can bring that authentic and real emotion, feeling, and touch to the events depicted. Perhaps no recent film has better embodied this than The Big Sick. Though directed by Michael Showalter, this is really Kumail Nanjiani and Emily Gordon's show. The married pair of screenwriters who sat down and put the story of their meeting, Emily's illness, the issues regarding a Pakistani immigrant and American girl dating, and their eventual reunion. Wherever they may take liberties with their own story to make it more cinematic - if these moments exist - does nothing to stamp out the way in which the film deftly handles a variety of issues. Whatever bridge is tries to cross, it does so running. Finding the comedy in joy, sadness, pain, rejection, and anxiety, The Big Sick is often a profound and moving experience, but is always a thoroughly enjoyable one. How it manages to become this is because of one simple fact: Nanjiani and Gordon were there, so they know how it all felt.

Kumail Nanjiani is this romantic comedy with Zoe Kazan starring as Kumail's real wife, Emily. A Pakistani immigrant, Kumail is a stand-up comedian who must cope with his family's strict religious beliefs and fervent desire for him to meet a Pakistani girl. Along the way, he meets cute with Emily and the two quickly hit it off. In portraying the issues Kumail has with his family and how it impacts his relationship, The Big Sick benefits greatly from being written by those who experienced the feeling. As a result of Kumail's family, their relationship is highly complex. If they stay together, then Kumail is exiled from his family and Emily feels remorse for being the cause behind him losing his family. However, if they keep their relationship hidden as Kumail intends, then Emily is hurt as it makes it feel as though he does not want her in the way that she wants him. It is a slippery slope and one that must be confronted. Having everyone walk away happy is likely improbable due to the steep barrier of culture keeping them apart. Worsening the situation is all of the little intricacies of which they remain blissfully unaware, highlighted by Kumail having to constantly explain arranged marriage to Emily and those around them. This gulf in culture, no matter how Americanized Kumail has become, will always be there and must be approached cautiously by both sides.

Where the film really soars, however, is when Emily is not even there. Zoe Kazan is fantastic, but the film becomes quite profound when Kumail is thrust into a situation where he must cope with Emily's illness and meeting her parents. Terry (Ray Romano) and Beth (Holly Hunter) rush from North Carolina to care for their daughter as she fights off a mystery illness and also meet Kumail for the first time. Reeling from the two breaking up due to Kumail's unwillingness to lose his family and Emily's unwillingness to make him lose his family, it is a rather awkward situation for him with Beth knowing all of the sordid details, including Kumail's lying and dishonesty regarding his family. Thus, tensions run quite high initially before they come to bond over one thing: Emily. Their love, care, fear, and pain, that is shared with each ebb and flow of her illness and the frustration felt when the doctors are clueless, brings them together. They reach deep within themselves to overcome this and the writing by Nanjiani and Gordon is raw, emotional, and powerful. This area is perhaps mostly driven by Nanjiani considering Gordon was not there, but the film nonetheless captures the emotions of everybody involved brilliantly. Watching a loved one fight an illness is a truly helpless feeling, worsened when doctors are unsure why it is happening (which is always). The Big Sick never feels exploitative, is smartly written in this arena, and captures both the light moments that bring a smile to your face - Beth showing old high school photos of Emily in her ""goth phase"" to Kumail - and the shared sadness when the news is particularly hard. All of this culminates into the greatest release: Emily overcoming his illness.

Though a true story and obviously going to end up with Kumail and Emily being together, the film smartly never falls into the trap of rushing them back together when she overcomes her illness. As she fights, the film lays the groundwork for this in its inclusion of Terry's infidelity. It is clear before this reveal that Terry and Beth are constantly at one another's throats. In hearing it from Terry, he was forgiven by her but she never let go of it and never was able to overcome her hurt from his transgression. For his part, he still hates himself for what he did to her. It is a slow process of healing for their relationship with both sleeping in separate beds. Taking years of healing, The Big Sick sums it up quite neatly with Beth coming back into Terry's bed, but it highlights the slow build-up."
414,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-big-sick/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Jul 7, 2017",9,"Best movie of the year so far BUT...
“The Big Sick” is an excellent movie with only 3 negatives, two really minor and another, in my opinion, major but I got over it!

The movie is being sold as a romantic comedy, which two thirds of it is, but a major third is the drama and all are in equal parts. With Kumail Nanjiani, who I am familiar with from the HBO show “Silicon Valley”, starring and Judd Apatow producing I expected a lot of laughs and they are delivered in grins, smiles, laughs, out loud guffaws along with nods of the head that derive from real moments in life that all can identify. The drama also gets the spotlight and in some scenes you will be crying and laughing at the same time while in others the tears will flow. Yes the romance is there and it is as romantic as in any film you have seen.

The two really minor negatives, surprisingly, are the stand up routines by the real in life stand up comics Aidy Bryant, Kurt Braunohler and Bo Burnham and the interactions between them and Kumail but none really take up that much time.

Not getting into the screenplay itself, written by Nanjiani and his real wife Emily V. Gordon and based on their true romance, the acting is some of the finest from the whole cast including what would be considered minor roles such as the nurse played by Myra Lucretia Taylor and Kuhoo Verma as a potential bride.  Anupan Kher and Zenobia as his parents could teach today’s parents in how to make your child feel guilty, especially the mother.

A big discovery for me was Zoe Kazan who I don’t recall seeing before. She makes Emily a real person whether it be in her kookiness, ‘only having sex once the first time with somebody’, who is going to be a therapist and in some scenes could really use therapy. She makes a lasting impression any time she is on screen but also has you thinking of her when she is not in a scene.

Ray Romano has never caught my attention as I was usually more interested in his co-stars, whether on television or movies, but here as a father, referring to his daughter, says “Being a parent is a nightmare. Loving somebody this much ****” he is funny and heartbreaking sometimes in the same sentence.

I could talk for days about Holly Hunter’s performance in “Big Sick”. She appears on screen about 30-40 minutes into the film and steals every scene from everyone in the film for the rest of the film. No way do you want to get her teed off in a comic club because no matter how tall or big you are you aren’t going to win! Don’t you dare hurt her daughter because you will get her wrath, sneers and coldness but show her daughter love and with one gesture you know you will never be able to do anything wrong again. I certainly hope she is remembered at award time.

Yes Kumail Nanjiani is playing himself, even being called Kumail, but you get to know more than the comedian. You get to know the man, the actor, the writer, the comedian, the man who can woo women with doe eyes, a smile and caring. I hope he gets to do more roles where he is involved as a person who happens to also be a comedian or not.



The “The Big Sick” is a must see movie and be prepared to laugh, cry and, yes, experience the drama of the title."

Yeaah another NBC film, I guess no words needed to explain how it was amazing in terms of photography, cinematography and so on. It is just another NBC work and how it has to be. But what I liked about this film was firstly successful explanation of existential problems of people from small village. Maybe its topic seems dull or monotonous, but the way that NBC expressed the problem is very strong. Secondly, films may be longer than standard films (3 hours). If you think there are lots of scenes that make film boring, I am sorry but you are mistaken. Because at the end I felt that every scene was necessary to get closer to Sinan's feelings. All of scenes as if helps us to understand, perceive Sinan`s feelings . There was one scene where Her Mother watched some turkish film alongside her daughter, in the scene from film, mother (I guess) slapped his son`s face. Maybe that episodes inspired mother to make ""why didn`t you get the money from him, I sent to you there bla blah"" conversation with her own son, Sinan. It is not secret that we all can be inspired by something and apply it somehow. Or just the topic and conversation with these religions guys maybe show Sinan`s concern or protest about his father. And I would love to say that final scene where there was one shot, Sinan used suicide method to finish his life, actually there were 2 times of suicide message. But it showed Sinan killed previous Sinan (?) and kill his feelings towards his father or even maybe give up on his poetry passions alongside the previous reasons.  Yeaaah you see how powerful this film is. Especially 3 moments touched me so hard. Firstly Sinan`s conversation with his mother when he gave his book to his mom with own signature, Secondly again her conversation with his mom after his father throw away his dog`s pic, and finally when Sinan`s found out newspaper`s article about his own Ahlat Agaci book in dad`s pocket.

Ahlat Agaci

Bilge Ceylan's making of a book is as meticulous as it can get, throbbing arguments that never crosses the line to be a preaching-to-the-choir tone, this drama is more horror than it claims to be. And similar to the summary of the plot- a son returns hometown after graduation and gets **** into the sleazy schemes of his gambling father- the first act of the film can arguably considered as a bluff. And the journey of surprising us in each steps after the first act, that it promises to deliver us consistently, has its own cathartic release. But mind you, this game is played subconsciously with us, while the real drama on the screen comes like Rosefeldt's Manifesto- of course without sounding like a pretentious robotic monologue.

I would consider this as writers major win among all the others. The writers always had in mind to go deep into hardcore debates of world politics, life changing inspirations and seduce-like negative emotions that grows like cancer as one ages. And their procedure is pure bravura of work, initiating from one of my favorite meetings of our protagonist with his somewhat-like-an-old-lover, the film deals with the social issues that is justified and well crafted out in narration since there was a ticking clock behind them.

Cut to another nail-biting argument with an established writer, breaking the wall of celebrity and fan equation, the heating conversation is used as the primary weapon to start initiating on fabricating the other side of our lead character; this is the turning point of the film. Followed by another major discussion of probably everything, among his friends, the writers calls it a day on the preaching note as the viewers are left both cheated and challenged at the brisk of their seat.

While our so called hero struggles with the rest of the world like such, along with the **** of his father's debt collectors, there is an entirely different game played in his house. But frankly, I would pity the actor to even show up on screen to share it with Cemcir, not only for his brilliant performance but the power that the character he plays has on the film. That three dimensional persona never fails to amaze us, from his half crooked smile to his ideologies, his character is peeled off layer by layer.

And clearly the makers were most euphoric about him, the way other characters speak about his great deeds and how he is so devoted to his work (in the final act, when his son comes to visit him, he still is keeping an eye on his students) despite of being flawed, just makes him more and more rich. There is a lot to listen and lot to ponder about, but as it was intended, the equation of a father and a son will melt you down in the end and to pull off that scene after implementing the fact that Demirkol leaves him without any help lying on the ground, has got to be the biggest development of the film. The Wild Pear Tree is every bit of wild as it has right to be."

Una dolorosa y soprendente parábola cristiana


Sumario

La iglesia de la salvación es una película notable, una dolorosa parábola cristiana que tiene la virtud de plantear la religiosidad y la misión pastoral como un problema existencial antes que místico, como un compromiso que puede tomar caminos insospechados. Y lo hace de la mano del Reverendo Toller, un personaje reconcentrado y de un callado dolor, a cargo de Ethan Hawke en una actuación excepcional.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reseña

El reverendo Toller (Ethan Hawke) llega al norte del Estado de Nueva York para hacerse cargo de la antigua iglesia protestante First Reformed, de origen calvinista, que está administrada por el moderno centro cristiano Abundant Life, que a su vez se propone volverla a consagrar. El encuentro de Toller con Michael, un activista ecológico (Philip Ettinger) y su esposa Mary (Amanda Seyfried) llevará al religioso a serios replanteos sobre su misión pastoral.

Ese encuentro de Toller (quien llega a la iglesia acarreando una historia de pérdidas y enfermedad) con ese matrimonio (siendo Michael, un activista profundamente escéptico) dispara el recorrido del reverendo y de la película por una cantidad de situaciones que tienen que ver con la religiosidad y su ejercicio, con el contraste entre su iglesia y el modelo de gestión de Abundant Life y por un camino de revelación para Toller, un personaje reconcentrado y dolorido.

La película de Paul Schrader, si bien muy estadounidense en parte de su temática, tiene un estilo muy cercano al cine europeo, con varios planos fijos y un ritmo tranquilo pero nunca quieto respecto del devenir de su protagonista. Ethan Hawke, con su Reverendo Toller, nos brinda una actuación extraordinaria, sobria y dolorosa, secundado por una Amanda Seyfried notable.

Este film tiene la rara virtud de tratar la religiosidad y la parábola religiosa de su protagonista de un modo existencial antes que místico, de una manera que puede conmover a un espectador no religioso, derribando sus resistencias, con una trascendencia que recuerda a la de los filmes de Bruno Dumont y coronado por un final absolutamente epifánico.

A painful and surprising Christian parable


Summary

First Reformed is a remarkable film, a painful Christian parable that has the virtue of posing religiosity and pastoral mission as an existential problem rather than a mystical one, as a commitment that can take unexpected paths. And it does so from the hand of Reverend Toller, a concentrated character and quiet pain, in charge of Ethan Hawke in an exceptional performance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Review

Reverend Toller (Ethan Hawke) arrives in Upstate New York to take over the former Calvinist First Reformed Protestant Church, which is run by the modern Christian Abundant Life Center, which in turn intends to re-consecrate it. . Toller's encounter with Michael, an ecological activist (Philip Ettinger), and his wife Mary (Amanda Seyfried) will lead the priest to serious rethinks about his pastoral mission.

That meeting of Toller (who comes to church carrying a history of loss and illness) with that marriage (being Michael, a deeply skeptical activist) triggers the reverend and the film's journey through a number of situations that have to do with the religiosity and its exercise, with the contrast between his church and the management model of Abundant Life and on a path of revelation for Toller, a concentrated and in pain.

Paul Schrader's film, although very American in part of its theme, has a style very close to European cinema, with several fixed shots and a calm but never still rhythm regarding the future of its protagonist. Ethan Hawke, with his Reverend Toller, gives us an extraordinary, sober and painful performance, backed up by a remarkable Amanda Seyfried.

This film has the rare virtue of treating the religiosity and the religious parable of its protagonist in an existential rather than mystical way, in a way that can move a non-religious viewer, breaking down their resistance, with a transcendence reminiscent of that of the films by Bruno Dumont and crowned by an absolutely epiphanic ending."

Pero también hay espacio para colores más oscuros. La película aprovecha de una manera magnifica todos los elementos cinematográficos y así sabe como crear ambientes valiéndose solo del la iluminación y fotografía, en su mayor parte sin música. Escenas con elementos surrealistas se usan como metáforas que refuerzan el tono de la historia .Pero aparte de la fotografía la interpretación de Ethan Hawke como Toller es conmovedora y convincente.

It's strange, two years ago Paul Schrader made the most convoluted movie of his career with 'Dog Eat Dog', then make something so masterful like this. Anywhere...

'First Reformed' is easily one of my favorite movies of 2018. Absolutely captivating from start till finish. A strong character study on faith and pain. An Excellent performances from Ethan Hawke, who's facial expressions and his tried voice says so much about the character. You're just waiting for his frustration to explode. Also, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer, and Philip Ettinger were all superb.

My only issues with the film is it's main message about the environment, which got a little heavy handed after awhile, to the point where you're just thinking ""OK, I get it"". I mean, when you get a scene involving stock footage of nature and power stations while Hawke and Seyfried are on top with each other. But that's really it for complaints. Enough of that, back to the positives.

The writing is fantastic, of course not surprising coming from Paul Schrader. The cinematography is stunning. You get a lot of wide shots, close ups, and plenty of emptiness and space around our priest. There's literally a shot in this movie that's taken straight from 'Taxi Driver'.

454,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/first-reformed/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,AndrewBurge,"Aug 22, 2018",8,"Bleak, patient and narrative, 'First Reformed' is one hell of a tough film to review. It hides away from you in an attempt to elevate its art to near poetry. And it succeeds. Writer/director Paul Schrader teams up with Ethan Hawke, who gives the performance of his career as Reverend Ernst Toller, a small town priest whose faith is put to the test, having his doubts manifested in a riveting, albeit tame manner.

The script is dominated by a beautiful narrative. Toller indulges in an experiment to keep a journal for a year and then destroy it. We get the impression he is looking for closure, and very soon we find out why. He suffers from a disease which is never fully shown to us, but given the fact that he urinates blood and that he can barely stand, it must be bad. This is the weird but brilliant structure of the narrative. It says a lot, but it never disclosures more than it needs to. Schrader does not use it to advance the plot, but rather to engulf us deeper into the mind of Ernst Toller, who constantly grapples with faith, isolation, regret and despair in the modern world.

Despair, most of all. One of the very first scenes includes a captivating discussion between him and Michael (Philip Ettinger), a troubled environmentalist who lost his faith in society. He babbles continuously about an environmental fallout and his wife, Mary (Amanda Seyfried) called the reverend to help him. This scene is especially captivating as it is the first one where we witness Schrader's incredibly bleak and silent cinema. It is too quiet in there. A quiet which is brilliantly maximized by the beating of the clock.

This bleakness spreads through the entire picture, which is accompanied by no music, except occasional crescent rumbles, often accompanied by beautiful and depressing shots of industrialism. It also helps that this film was filmed in a classic 4:3 aspect ratio which, at first, I found irrelevant, but it offers some truly picturesque imagery.

So, while 'First Reformed' might be a bit controlling and chastised, it is mind bending, slightly shocking and purgatorial."
455,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/first-reformed/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DavidWasHere,"Aug 22, 2018",10,"Paul Schrader is best known as a writer than he is as a director, best known for his work with Martin Scorsese writing the screenplays for Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, the Last Temptation of Christ, and Bringing Out the Dead. And while he has continued to work, he has not made a movie outside of the shadows of the former two films. First Reformed might as well be that shot of acclaim. What Paul Schrader did is make a breathtaking examination of depression and salvation.

The first thing that is striking is the atmosphere, creating an ambient tone of quiet and grey, symbolizing the state of mind of the main character. All of which matched by the amazing cinematography Alexander Dynan. The movie has a unique framing, being shot in 16:9, or fullscreen. I'm not sure why exactly, but Schrader made it works regardless. The acting is also great too, with Ethan Hawke giving what might be his best performance of his career, definitely worth an Oscar (or at least a nomination), with Amanda Seyfried and Cedric Kyles (a.k.a. Cedric the Entertainer) delivering some fantastic supporting roles.

I feel like one of the most divisive aspects of the film is the reoccurring environmental messages. I will admit it can be preachy, however I don't really mind because the movie is more about depression and a deconstruction of salvation and God. It's brilliant with how Schrader uses God with the examination of hopelessness and the feeling of regret and betrayal in the backdrop of serious issues that really compliments what is going on. Also more of a nitpick but I wish the movie was entirely set in silence than having an ambient score that doesn't really show up a lot, but it did it's job well enough so I can't complain.

Overall, First Reformed is a brilliant movie that is powerful in it's unsettling deconstruction of the Church. It's hard to watch, but one that you won't forget!"

But definitely the actor without taking risks - which are not necessary - delivers a solid, emotional and sensitive performance with which undoubtedly becomes the strongest reason to watch this film. There are other good interventions, especially from Amanda Seyfried, but the film belongs completely to Hawke.

The story is simple but penetrating and intense. A look at depression in a daily routine centered on the thoughts of the character of Hawke: a tormented priest who decides to translate into a diary everything that happens to him, in scenes that work as excellent internal monologues about his mental state.

It's dark and also a bit ambiguous, especially the ending but it's a pretty good film and another success for A24."

Most reviews I've seen of First Reformed have praised it as Paul Schrader's best work since either Taxi Driver or Raging Bull. And whilst I think that's an oversimplification, unjustly ignoring such strong screenplays as The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) and Bringing out the Dead (1999), and such superb directorial work as Affliction (1997) and Auto Focus (2002), there can be little doubt that First Reformed is easily his best film of the last fifteen years or so.

The film tells a simple story - Reverend Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke) is the parish priest of a small congregation in Snowbridge. A former military chaplain, Toller is struggling with the death of his son, who he encouraged to enlist, and who was killed several months into his first tour in Iraq. As a result, Toller's marriage fell apart, with his wife blaming him for Joseph's death. As the film begins, Toller's spiritual crisis is already well under way. He's drinking too much, doesn't show much interest in his official duties, and has taken to recording his thoughts in a journal which he plans to keep for one year, and then destroy. After Sunday mass, Toller is approached by Mary (Amanda Seyfried), one of his parishioners, who is worried about her husband, Michael (Philip Ettinger). A radical environmentalist who has just been released from prison in Canada, Michael has developed extreme nihilistic views, and wants Mary to abort their unborn child because he doesn't think anyone has the right to bring a child into a dying world. Although initially reluctant to get involved, Mary is able to persuade Toller to counsel Michael, bringing his own spiritual dilemma to the fore.

The most striking thing to me about First Reformed is that it is brilliantly shot in Academy ratio (1.37:1), and as a result, everything is boxed in, suggesting little room for movement, with very little empty space in the frame. Coupled with this, Schrader is remarkably consistent in composing perfectly symmetrical shots (the opening scene is a good example). Together, the small frame and the symmetrical compositions give one the impression of looking at a confessional, with the priest on one side and the confessor on the other. As Toller's journal entries occur throughout the film in the form of voiceover, this aesthetic replication of a confessional is enhanced even further. Schrader allows the content to brilliantly dictate the form, with the two becoming so intertwined as to be virtually indistinguishable from one another.

Of course, Schrader is as cine-literate as they come, and doesn't make films in isolation. The film in his oeuvre of which I was most reminded was, strangely enough, Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist (2005), which is not especially good, but which does share many of the same narrative beats and thematic concerns - a lost priest whose experiences of the darker side of humanity has led to him questioning his faith; a crisis of conscience; a righteous cause to which he totally gives himself over; an indifferent God watching everything unfold; an unimaginable sacrifice; hope offered in the form of an innocent.

However, this is not to say First Reformed is perfect. There are parts where it is extraordinarily clunky. For example, there's a wake where a group of environmentalists start singing an awful cappella version of Neil Young's activist song, ""Who's Gonna Stand up?"", or the scene where Mary and Toller take (figurative) flight through the power of holding hands (in a scene that reminded me of The Big Lebowski far more than I would imagine was intended. Additionally, the environmentalist side of the story never really coalesced into anything inherently coherent. Rather than the film presenting it as the backdrop against which Toller's crisis takes place, Schrader seems to be trying to genuinely shoehorn in a call-to-action. Which is fairly out of place. And, to be honest, the photograph of the emaciated polar bear is far more disturbing and resonant than any of the facts and figures the film occasionally tosses out.

But these are minor faults, and all things considered, this is a high-quality film. Will it be in contention come awards season? Possibly. Schrader has always had a fraught relationship with the Academy (hard to believe he's never even been nominated for an Oscar), but this is the kind of serious subject matter that voters usually lap up. I certainly wouldn't be surprised to see Hawke get some acting nods, possibly Seyfried too. Irrespective of that, this is a strong film made by a skilled artist about a subject matter for which he clearly feels deeply."

First Reformed

3 And A Half Out Of 5

First Reformed is a character driven dramatic take on the repercussions that good and bad deeds leads to and has led to. The tone of the feature is poignant and dark that endorses its concept and is palpable to it throughout the course of the feature. The metaphorical cinematography and eerie d.o.p. helps lure in the audience and keep them intrigued in its pathos bubble and rooting for its pragmatic characters. The production design is neat, finely detailed and pleasing to encounter along with its stunning camera work. The emotions drawn out from the characters does communicate where the performance and execution plays a vital role along with a narrative element inserted as a habitual diary writing. The background score is edited and polished aptly and is also wisely absent at times, leaving the audience with an experience of listening a clock tick which frankly it has been a while since I encountered in a feature.

An unhealthy state and few cringe worthy moments are not only inedible and powerful but beautifully poetic that speaks volume in here. The writing is sharp, adaptive and gripping with thought-provoking policies that never grows pretentious and is instead kept subtle. Paul Schrader; the writer-director, has done an excellent work on executing and pulling off such an obscure world. As mentioned earlier, Ethan Hawke is achingly good and deserves all the praise for its majestic performance where he is supported decently by Amanda Seyfried. Schrader's world is helpless in here since the work is drawn out from each and every step and character which is more appalling and dark than its concept. Few mellow monologues, its slow yet impactful character development and soothing little tactics to sweeten the moments are the high points of the feature. First Reformed is an apotheosis of humane emotions whose subjective procedure makes worth its final product."

This is the actual email that I just sent to a friend, recommending this movie with some caveats:  ""Dear (so-and-so), The Ethan Hawke movie I mentioned is at the Avon. It’s called “First Reformed.”  You might like it. Or might not! It’s different… it would definitely not be everyone’s cup of tea, though. He is the minister of a church, sent to counsel a woman whose husband is depressed and possibly suicidal. And Ethan has his own issues. (And you have to listen carefully to some monologues to understand his inner workings.) So it’s not exactly uplifting, but Ethan Hawke is good in it, and I am a fan of his, so that’s why I went to see it. The ending was remarkable – literally – as leaving the theatre, a number of different  unrelated moviegoers paused to discuss the ending, each having come away with a different impression, yet fully convinced that was the only possible way to see it. (Of course, my reaction was the only feasible one, heh-heh.)"""

Ethan Hawke gives a career-best here as far as I'm concerned and writer/director Paul Schrader is in top form as well.

468,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/first-reformed/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,imdoingmypart,"Jun 8, 2018",9,"""Will God forgive us?"" This question sits at the center of First Reformed, Paul Schrader's latest film dealing with faith, devotion, grief, morality, hypocrisy, and a general feeling of existential crisis. Ethan Hawke stars as Reverend Toller, a Catholic priest at a dying church in upstate New York. Toller is given the task of counseling a young married couple, more specifically the husband, who is becoming reclusive and radical according to his wife (played by Amanda Seyfriend). Toller does not offer judgment but rather wisdom and comfort, sometimes successfully while other times at a distance. While almost exclusively patient, calm, and well-intended, Toller is isolated and removed from the world around him.

Early in the film, Toller reveals that his son was killed in Iraq after joining the military due to family tradition.Though he does discuss the pain and grief following his son's death, Toller does not physically demonstrate his pain beyond his stoicism. It seems impossible that a man could remain so faithful and reverent after the loss of his child and the dissolution of his marriage. Make no mistake: though he keeps it subdued, Toller's grief is central to First Reformed and its exploration of multiple individuals' characters and beliefs. The film does not take jabs at some of the obvious forces present in the film - military, religion, activism, capitalism - but rather sits back and lets the audience form its own judgments.

First Reformed is most exciting in its ability to navigate its many ideas and emotions in near fluidity. While often a dramatic and tragic character study, the film, at times, is a horror film at heart. At other times, it is a study and comparison of faith and religion. Sometimes its characters are distant while at other times their actions can be completely justified. The same steady, patient camera captures one shot of personal outburst and another shot of a still wine glass just a couple scenes away. Few filmmakers can even attempt to cover the before-mentioned topics of personal faith, religious devotion, overwhelming grief, and morality and its justification all within a two hour time frame, but Schrader, the screenwriter of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, not only exceeds expectations but also manages to fit in creative camera work, quiet moments of speechless physical performance, comedic relief, and pointed questions that do not leave the audience unsatisfied but rather motivated to begin asking introspective questions that are too personal to be answered on screen. In many ways, First Reformed is difficult to discuss due to its piercing, personal nature. In other ways, it merits some of the most interesting discussion in film this year. First Reformed does not seek to ties its events and ideas up into a neat package but rather to quietly explode on screen and draw the audience not only to seek discussion with other viewers but also to open an internal discussion and personal exploration that only the masters of filmmaking can inspire."

Naturally, I assumed it was a horror film, or at least something dealing with the supernatural. Boy, I was in for a surprise. First Reformed is a slow burn drama, and a damn good one at that. The story of First Reformed is about Reverend Toller, who oversees First Reformed Church, which is a church that is almost 250 years old and is more of a tourist destination than a church at this point (although he does still hold Sunday sessions). There is nothing supernatural, and this isn't an in-your-face religious film, either. This film is about a lot of things. It has A LOT to say about the current state of the environment, and it even touches on politics and the power of corporations. But there's more than that, it's about the personal struggles of Reverend Toller, who has lived a life filled with isolation and sorrow ever since his son was killed in Iraq. We get a lot of insight into the character of Reverend Toller through personal journal entries that he makes and then reads for the audience, and it's made clear that while he may initially appear like a well kept together man, he is nothing of the sort. He is sick with what appears to be cancer, and he is a man filled with despair. When he finds something that makes him question everything (the current state of the environment), he slowly becomes engulfed by it, to a point that frankly I found quite shocking. This film is a very slow burn. It's very serious as well. You won't find much, if any, humor, so it relies purely on the story to keep the audience engaged, and it did just that. I was captivated until the very end, which I must say is something I've been thinking about all day. The acting is excellent, the script is fantastic, and the story kept me intrigued despite being very slow. First Reformed really is one of the best overall films of the year, and I'm sure it'll get some recognition when the award shows swing around. However, you might notice that I only gave it an 8, and really it came down to the fact that this isn't a film that I'm just gonna pop into the Blu-Ray player on a Saturday night when I wanna watch a movie. The re-watchability is just not super high, which inevitably brought down its score. That doesn't mean it's not a great film, though."

That is not to say that you have to be religious to enjoy this film. The character study is engrossing even if you aren’t a religious person at all. To say that Toller is in despair is an understatement and this is made worse by one of his parishioners, an environmentalist, who commits suicide in despair about his ability to help the environment just as Toller seems to feel he is not helping anyone, including himself. The former parishioner also leaves Toller the means to kill himself and make his own statement. Toller makes a tough choice, and I won’t reveal what it is, but I think you will be moved by this powerful film and the deeply felt character brought to life by Ethan Hawke."

This might be Ethan Hawke's best performance as an actor. Amanda Seyfried is also incredible, and Cedric the Entertainer also busts out some fine acting chops. There truly is not a weak link in the cast, even among the minor characters.

The script is a slow-burning engine that drives it's way home. You'll be really emotionally effected by First Reformed. If you are a fan of serious film, this is a must-see. I'll be genuinely surprised if Hawke and Schrader don't get nominations at this year's Academy Awards."

The key to Baby Driver is its music, which thumps and grooves in time with the chaos outside our driver's private little bubble, so it's a good thing the soundtrack is so hip and catchy. Peppered with a broad mix of genres - motown hits, classic rock, old school hip-hop, first-wave punk, britpop - somehow it all fits together swimmingly, an expertly-paired tune for each mood that smoothly eases right into the next track. It's stylish and fun, with subtle winks and clever lyrical Easter eggs snuggled lovingly into the scenery, but the gimmick never feels too cute.

The plot is simple and straightforward, no risk of bucking distracted viewers here, and while a little extra depth might have given us more to chew on, it also would've robbed the film of its charms. There's a certain puppy dog innocence to the whole thing, despite the storm of bullets and bloody end to so many primary cast members, that's not unlike director Edgar Wright's earlier films. A great dose of pure, high-octane summer entertainment with a musical spirit to rival Guardians of the Galaxy, it's just a hair on the light side."

The movie is shot very dynamically, which makes it look very modern.

They seem to succeed at it, yet it is not at all natural. I also had a hard time empathising with the movie's love narrative.

Sí, me gustaría contradecirme en decir cliché original. La película es fantástica, tiene un protagonista con personalidad exagerada, escenas de acción fantasiosas, un villano muy villano con una motivación que hemos visto antes y un final feliz ¿Pero por qué todo esto no es una película estupida de Michael Bale? Porque es de Edgar **** Wright.

Todos los elementos conocidos están contados de una forma diferente, pese a que haya elementos clásicos de películas, la forma de contarlas de Egar Wright es maravillosa, el personaje de Baby es fantástico y si esta película gana popularidad con los años se hará de culto.

No, amigos, está película no es solo para cinéfilos aburridos que quieren ver mensajes y enseñanzas en todo, es una película bien escrita de acción y persecución que pueden ver todos: cinéfilos esperando escenas bien dirigidas con actuaciones increíbles, tu mamá que busca ver una película, tu novia que quería ver algo romántico y tu papá que quiere ver disparos y explosiones.
Baby Drive para mí es un 8.9/10 con una nota de sobresaliente."

Ansel Elgort is a daring and likeable, Jon Hamm is bold and charismatic, and all the other performances are just so stellar they can't all be listed in this short review. But the part that really makes this movie a masterpiece is the music. Edgar Wright's choice to mold the scene to the music is genius. The soundtrack of this movie transcends all expectations and makes the viewer feel raw emotions all throughout the film. Solid must watch for anyone."

The opening scene is so iconic in and of itself that it almost immediately makes the film for me. It sets up the idea that the film will be flowing with the soundtrack and that music is important to the main character because of some personal trauma.

Where it drags for me are with two performances, those of Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey. For me Jamie Foxx is trying too hard to be an intimidating bad guy that he almost reaches Jared Leto's 'Joker' for me. Meanwhile, Kevin Spacey's performance is pretty lackluster and forgettable, even before the news about his past came out. His roll could've been better filled by someone else with a better presence, perhaps Kurt Russel? Overall it's a fun movie and has a lot of intricate sequences that should be watched with a keen eye, definitely give it a watch."

The film is like a dance,in wich every single action goes with the music **** particular the car chase scene and the scenes of Baby dancing around town.Disability plays a large part in the film as well,Baby sickness is the reason for all the music and the film does a great job showing us his **** cast also does a stellar job in portraying this characters,a highlight here is Jamie Fox with a very sly and fitting performance.

The weakest part of the film is the love story being told here wich failed to be very compelling in my opinion,though i can't tell you about it very much because it would be a spoiler,a lot of things happen here that make little sense.

Anyway Baby driver is a great film that plays to edgar Wrights strengths and is enjoyable throughout,making it worth your time."

In a film landscape that is crowded by superhero slop, Hollywood safe action movies, and Oscar-bait- it's refreshing to find a film that takes a genre that's been done to death, but subverts your expectations by adding an original spin to it. This movie is just a long music video for somebody's mixtape, and I loved every second of it. It knows exactly when it needs to be funny and when it needs to be serious, and the casting was absolutely perfect. Not to mention that I couldn't think of a better actor or actress for any of the characters, it has a completely all-star cast. If I had any criticism, it's that after the stellar opening act, the next 30 minutes seem a bit slow in comparison. It enters kind of a weird tonal shift, but by the time the credits roll you've forgotten all about that. The editing, sound mixing, and effects take you on an unforgettable ride. Near perfect."

516,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/baby-driver/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MiniMovieManiac,"Feb 6, 2019",8,"To start off, Edgar Wright’s writing and directing style shines so brightly in this movie.  The look and feel of the world created in this movie is both stylistic and very realistic in terms of what a city today looks like.  The sets had a very artistic feel and showcased art that would be found all around cities today, making you feel even more immersed in this movie.  Edgar Wright proves yet again that he is a master of scenery with how amazing the display of color and joy of the city.  In movies today, I feel that we only see darker colors, only to get a grim display and unrealistic feel of what it is like in a nice city during the day.

The car chase scene were the marvel of this movie and have you on the edge of your seat during the entire movie.  every car chase scene is practical and the stunts are amazing to watch.  The use of practical stunts made for a more realistic feel and gave grit to the movie.  It wasn’t over bloated like certain car chase movies are made today.  For example, while I love the Fast and Furious films, the car scenes got increasingly ridiculous and just weren’t believable at all.  For Baby Driver, you believe every second that someone is driving that car and no CGI crap was put in to try and trick you.  I appreciate filmmaking like that, the use of practical stunts when they can be used is a great money saver and payoff for the movie and audience.

While all the performances and characters were directed and played very well, there was one character that didn’t sit well with me.  That was Bats, played by Jamie Foxx, because this character was good but had me annoyed almost every time he was on screen.  That’s not to say Jamie Foxx didn’t own every scene he was in, but every time he was on screen, he killed someone.  The heartlessness of the character was just something I couldn’t enjoy and I found the worst character in the movie.  What set me over the edge was a certain part in the movie where Bats almost killed someone Baby really cared about.  Like I said, Jamie Foxx is in no way bad at all, it’s just his character had no payoff and lacked even a lick of compassion that we like to see in bad characters.

The one thing that could make or break this movie for some people is the love story between Baby and Debora.  I can see some people buying into it completely and enjoying it for the entire movie.  But, there are some parts that feel forced, particularly with how fast the two characters find love for each other.  That might turn some people away from the movie and cause them to not enjoy the movie as much as others might.  While I did buy into the love story, some people might find it hard to believe and become invested in throughout the movie.  The reason this is the make or break point for this movie is because it’s one of those subplots that some will say could’ve been completely removed.  If it had been removed, we still would’ve gotten a pretty good heist movie but some probably would’ve felt as if there was no payoff for Baby at the end if they cut the love story.  So, that’s up to you when you see the movie whether to be invested in the love story or not.

Edgar Wright shows once again he is one of the best directors working today.  His direction and writing are perfect for this movie and the have your eyes glued to the screen throughout.  The performances are spot on, the music great and car chases thrilling.  Baby Driver gives originality to a genre that has been done over and over again has one of the most investing stories in a genre that is very limited in some ways.  As much as I adore Logan in 2017, I would say Baby Driver now takes the title of best movie of 2017 in my book."

Lets start with the cars. I have not been a fan of Fast and Furious films, but the chase scenes in this film run circles around that series if a certain reality of the moves matters to you. This is more in line with Bullit,French Connection, and the Italian Job films as far as great chases.

The music, fun, simply fun. Songs from every decade of my lifetime. Action best pure adrenaline action in years. You will be truly on the edge of your seat during much of the film.

Humor, what can I say, love Edgar Wright's humor and this is his best.

And oh what a cast! Loved every one of the leads performances. I think Ansel was a standout, but come on Jamie Foxx, Spacey, Hamm and the beautiful Lily James. And the other leading lady, Eiza Gonzalez, was unknown to me, but she was great with one terrific diner speech in particular.

Best film so far this year."

526,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/crip-camp-a-disability-revolution/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Brent_Marchant,"Apr 7, 2021",7,"When the 1960s civil rights movement got into high gear, one constituency seeking equality felt left out -- disabled Americans. But they were not to be denied, and they began finding their voice through a summer camp in the Catskills designed to enable them to experience the feelings of mainstream living. Drawing upon their time here, they would later adapt the lessons learned to push for the equal rights that would eventually become embodied in the Americans with Disabilities Act, an initiative that would go on to have implications internationally. Through a wealth of archive footage and interviews with camp residents and counselors (many of whom were hippies and minorities, themselves seekers of reform and equal rights), directors James Lebrecht and Nicole Newnham tell this little-known story in a revealing and often quite surprising documentary, filled with an array of moments ranging from touching to heartbreaking to inspiring and even hilarious. However, for all its strengths, the film is not without its shortcomings, such as not enough linkage between camp life experience and the legacy it inspired, as well as some less-than-ideal selections of archive footage that seem more incidental than enlightening, material that could have easily been cut. Still, it's indeed captivating to see what can emerge out of humble (and seemingly unrelated) beginnings and the tremendous impact they can have, perhaps the film's greatest asset of all."

Dame Eileen Atkins, Dame Judi Dench, Dame Joan Plowright and Dame Maggie Smith have no problem making fun of the Dame title but they are at the same time proud of it and having it presented to them by either Queen Elizabeth or Prince Phillip.

The 4 ladies have no problem 'dishing' themselves, each other, their husbands, their co-stars, sometimes their work but they are very respectful of the theatre, more so than the movies or television they have done.

The 4 women get together every year at Plowright's Sussex home, where she lived with Laurence Olivier, to hear what each has been up to and some of the past. We see snippets of film from past experiences only making us hungry for more just as we want more of their reminiscing of the various mediums they played in and talk about why some succeeded and others didn't.

Plowright, now blind, and Atkins may not be as well known as Dench and Smith but all are given equal time to talk about their looks, or lack of them, when they started, though nothing is referred regarding the #METOO so prevalent today while the casting couch was part of the norm when they entered the theatre world, let alone the world of film.

Instead of drinking water or tea and a toast of champagne at the end, it would have been a lot more fun if it had been reversed though all 4 Dames don't hold back in expressing their feelings nor letting their laughs come through whether laughing at themselves or each other.

The major weaknesses were two: not enough structure or interesting questions/topics (even the actresses looked bored sometimes) and if you like British theater, you will be left hungry to see the full performances by these actresses shown in dozens of short snippets of their work on archival film and videotape. And there was absolutely too much chatter about Laurence Olivier without any real insight or substance. More theatre gossip and more talk about how they approached their classic roles would have been welcome also.

It's very moving and the personal testimonies make it even more so, with one of the hardest parts being the end for the story isn't technically over since it deals with a real life matter though lacking closure but even that is positive because it reawakens the desire for justice for those who are still struggling.

This is a film worthy of such an honor as its stars, Shabab Hoosini and Taraneh Alidoosti, portray a married couple involved in live theater as they perform the play within the play, i.e. “Death of a Salesman” ( hence the film’s title). In most cases dialogue in a foreign language with English titles can be a significant obstacle for an audience to properly enjoy a film’s value and worth but such is not the case here.

""The Salesman"" is a phycological drama about violence, love, revenge, inequality between men and women in Iranian society based on shame and honor, and many other things. We need to keep in mind that Farhadi had to use Aesopian language to let his film pass Iranian censorship. There are many episodes in this movie that are meaningful and symbolic but they are too ambiguous to know what exactly did Farhadi mean.

For instance, when a window glass is cracking, does it mean a family in distress or a society falling apart?

It could be either, or both.

The movie seemed a bit too long for me, and I did not like that it was shot by hand-held camera. But obviously, Farhadi is a master of filmmaking. I do not think this movie is his best but I will see it again, and maybe more than once."

It starts as a couple is forced to evacuate their apartment and move into a new building. When they return home from their production of ""Death of a Salesman,"" an unfortunate incident launches the drama with grief and suspicion. In American hands, this would be a high-pitched angry drama, but in the apprehensive culture of Iran and the underplayed style of the director, it's rendered as a more sober experience. There's virtually no music. The pacing is deliberate. Tension rises slightly during the compelling final encounter, but it remains emotionally subdued. This film provides interesting cultural insights and subtle performances, but the meandering pace requires patience."

(highly recommended to read these two plays before watching this movie **** by Gholam Hossein Saedi and 2.Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller)
The salesman is really breathtaking and it has all the familiar factor of farhadi’s movies with a big difference that there is not any sign of those open ends anymore and you associate with the main character of movie more than any time.
The story is about a young couple (Emad and Rana) who are performing at Arthur Miller’s play Death of a salesman. They have to move to another apartment because their apartment is going to collapse. This moving cause a serious issue in their life because of the old tenant.
In the beginning of the film when Emad_ with brilliant performance by Shahab Hosseini_ and his students was reading saedi’s play Cow, one of his student asked him “Sir,How does a man become cow?” Emad answered: “gradually”. This question and Emad’s answer are the main theme of this movie.
Farhadi has used some part of the play Death of a Salesman in his movie masterfully and he has chosen Emad for the Willy’s role in order to show and emphasize how Emad gradually got far away from his family or even his wife just like willy.
The last twenty minutes of film are really breathtaking and the spectators associate with Emad more than anytime and I think they regularly ask themselves “if I were him, what would I do?”
The salesman is a story about revenge or with accurate express is a story about the motivation of revenge.
This story like another fahadi’s movies occurs in a family and effects family members.
After A separation and now with the salesman Farhadi can be considered as a great master in directing suspenseful family drama like Hitchcock.

Being different to everyone around you. Knowing something is not quite right but not being able to put your finger on it. Director, writer and producer Jordan Peele expertly builds tension from the moment Chris arrives at the Armitage Estate, intricately weaving in several layers of intrigue and suspense until the shocking reveal."
564,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/get-out/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,drqshadow,"Sep 19, 2024",9,"Jordan Peele's screenwriting/directorial debut is quite the leap, exchanging the comedic chops one might expect for a potent blend of social commentary, suspense and horror. Peele shows us a creepy upper-class suburban atmosphere, host to a mixed-race couple's ""meet the parents"" moment, with a thick, permeating air of uncertainty and alarm. Everyone seems overly accepting of Chris, hometown girl Rose's new black boyfriend, but there's a look to their gaze that might imply something else. The town's dark-skinned residents, however, are less reserved. They behave like marionettes, Stepford Wives with an unnervingly wide smile: stiff, oddly-dressed and thoroughly disconcerting in posture and prose.

At first glance, I worried that the metaphors Peele was searching for would be too on-the-nose and blunt, but his well paced, muti-layered story soon brushes such concerns away. The analogies remain, but they're nuanced and subtle, effective players on a larger team. The arching storyline is twisting and unpredictable, a mystery that efficiently mixes real-world worries with tension-breaking laughs and personal connections to throw us off the scent. We don't know who's in on the scheme (or even what that scheme might be) until the very end, and for too long Chris is afraid to point fingers, lest he offend. Balancing social niceties with growing terror makes a great vehicle for this genre, and the prim-and-proper atmosphere only makes the occasional weird offhand remark or personal tick stick out that much more.

An excellent small-scale nail-biter, Get Out is richly crafted and razor-sharp, with a sensitive finger pressed right on the cultural pulse. Well worth the hype."

This film doesn’t judge people either, it’s a balanced and engaging story, very well acted with interesting characters. It is not political. I didn’t like the cinematography, the mixture of light blue and warm hues seemed pretty janky to me. There was also some warp stabiliser apparent especially for the car scenes. The dialogue quality was a little uneven, mostly on the men sounding a little crackly like hair rubbing on a microphone. The music was memorable although some choices didn’t feel appropriate. Some moments also felt scripted rather than natural. These are minor complaints though and only have a minor negative impact on the film. Get Out reminded me much more of Society (1989) and The Stepford Wives (1975) than Fight for Your Life (1977) which is a good thing as Fight for Your Life is a very obvious film whilst Get Out is more unexpected.

Add to that a very promising trailer, the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth (even with the very vocal detractors), and interest was higher.

High expectations were not only met but also exceeded. Apologies for the cliché, but to me that is the best way to sum up my personal experience watching 'Get Out'. Can totally see why it was as well received as it was, though can also see why it has divided audiences on here. While it will never be one of my favourite films, 'Get Out' is among the better films of 2017 and does live up to the hype.

It's an incredibly well-made film visually, with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to, and enhances, the unease and sense of dread.

That the direction was done by a first-time director is a shock in itself, one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me. It's nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the film's combative themes.

Being somebody who considers music important when talking about it, the music looms suitably ominously and fits well. 'Get Out' benefits from an extremely smart and clever script (though 'The Shape of Water' and especially 'Lady Bird' were worthier wins for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in my view), that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively.

Despite how it sounds, 'Get Out' struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements. It is highly successful on this front, with the thriller elements being taut, suspenseful and unsettling, the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy. There is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored, and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still.

While all the performances are very fine, it is Daniel Kaluuya's superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most.

My only complaint of 'Get Out' is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film, to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and that's it note.

Until then, the film was this close to being a masterpiece. So it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction. Nonetheless it's a great film that is among the year's better ones, brought down by an underwhelming ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

Sure, the scares come and when they do they're great. In fact, it could be a brilliant thriller film if it wanted to. It's not one of those movies which have way too many scares, with no focus being put upon the storytelling. The pace of the movie is really fast, which is good as in some horror films you feel like they focus more upon the setup and just deliver jump scares at the end. The performances are really good. Daniel Kaluuya is brilliant in the film. Just watch that scene where he first goes into the Sunken Place, excellent acting. I think Allison Williams goes really under the radar as she also gives a good performance. The screenplay and score was outstanding building that feeling of dread and realization that he couldn't get out of the place but was just stuck here.

No other way to put it. A masterpiece all over, and can you believe this came from JORDAN PEELE from the Key and Peele show? The best thing about this film is that it doesn't focus on the scares much. Sure, the scares come and when they do they're great. In fact, it could be a brilliant thriller film if it wanted to. It's not one of those movies which have way too many scares, with no focus being put upon the storytelling. The pace of the movie is really fast, which is good as in some horror films you feel like they focus more upon the setup and just deliver jump scares at the end. The performances are really good. Daniel Kaluuya is brilliant in the film. Just watch that scene where he first goes into the Sunken Place, excellent acting. I think Allison Williams goes really under the radar as she also gives a good performance. The screenplay and score was outstanding building that feeling of dread and realization that he couldn't get out of the place but was just stuck here. The story is fabulous with so many inventive and creative things making twists all the time. The final act is great, right when you understand everything on one go in that TV conversation scene. There's no wonder that this film won Best Original Screenplay at the oscars"

The cast are outstandingly brilliant and the plot for this movie is really good. Also, the movie's surprisingly very brutal and bloody in certain scenes and it's even got some great fight scenes throughout. Finally, I think Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) gave the best performance from start to finish throughout this amazing movie. Overall, it's honestly a brilliant horror/thriller movie and it's worth the watch.

Winehouse notably suffered from alcoholism and heroin in her last few years, coming in and out of rehab clinics. Winehouse suffered tragic breakups and terrible emotional strain, this is illustrative of how human she was. Amy recounts Winehouse’s entire musical career and more, but ultimately it serves as a message. Amy was made to show and remember the wonderful person that was Amy Winehouse. Amy is a reminder of the short span a human life holds, and that art and integrity often come from very dark places. For what it is Amy couldn’t have been a biopic. Amy is successful because of how the archive footage and interviews come together. This is a movie about art, artists, and the fragile line between life and death with which all of us walk every day.

And in those few minutes, skimming past pretty baby-faced boys and pairs of breasts that sing, relentlessly repetitive thumping beats that steal from - sorry, ""sample"" - far superior music from eons ago laden with lyrics that sing about nightclubs, sex and alcohol, and music videos that exist as little more than tawdry commercials for corporations to flog their products, one of the many messages of the film hit me over the head like an ashtray in a sock. Amy stands not only as a study of the downfall of an outstanding artist, but also of the music industry as a whole.

We all know this already: Amy Winehouse was an exceptionally talented, yet deeply troubled artist. But what many don't realise, and what this film beautifully shows, is what she stood for within the industry, and society as a whole. Amy simply did not fit in the modern music scene, where so much attention is devoted to sales figures, charts, money and looks, and so little to the art itself. What's more, she was taken advantage of by a long parade of people who were supposed to care for her, but instead used her humble and introverted nature for their own gains. The film is beautifully edited and tells its sad story very efficiently, combining previously unseen footage of the singer with interviews from the people who knew her best. It's made with care and sensitivity towards its subject, and it does what it sets out to do. Hopefully, those who see the film will forget the paparazzi photographs of her falling out of nightclubs and will instead think of her beautiful voice and her young, bright eyes full of hope - even if, alas, the outcome is in no doubt."

The best words to sum up ""Amy"" are heartbreaking, tragic and really depressing. It's a real shame that a talent like Winehouse could have some much wrong with her (mentally) and how her flaws killed her at the end. But she has left us with her talent and her knock out songs, and this Documentary brilliantly shows that. While it's not the best Documentary I've seen, because this one dose follow the same formula like other Documentary's do, but it is still great and absolutely worth watching."

Do you think anyone says 'I should have known him' after watching 'This Is It'. The answer is definitely yes. In the non-English speaking countries, many people don't know who Michael Jackson is or was. To me, this documentary is a similar case, I had no clue about who Amy Winehouse was or I never listened her musics before. So thanks to the director for this film and I also congratulate him for the Oscars nomination.

The movie was not complete. As any documentary this one too based on the recorded audio and video clips, and a series of interviews of whom she had worked with and closed ones. It was like a puzzle, but was arranged neatly in the chronological order. You know, you won't get all the truth from them, many stuffs remain mystery. So this is only a person's quality and character from many (people's) angles, but the accuracy, the honesty is with Amy that's never going to be revealed. Because only she knows about all she went through in her life like we do in our life.

Without arguably I agree films and documentary films are too short to squeeze all in about 2 hours to depict a person's entire life and people who watch it to judge that person is not justified. In this, the end was so sudden, like they had no more footages about what really happened. The trivia says Amy's father was not happy about the movie for the portrayal of his daughter, especially the last few years of her life. Only a very few know how much true this film is, but anyway something was very clear that he has not been the father she has wished for.

Every child deserves a good parenting. I feel Amy's struggle began from her childhood itself. But after the teenage, while becoming more independent, she lost her path, besides the fame poured in. She definitely had a gifted voice, she did not know how to manage it and someone should have been there to guide her. According to this film, I think the marriage was the beginning of the dark side of the Amy.

""When you looked at her lyrical and melodic capability,
she was a very old soul in a very young body.""

I have not seen all the Academy Award nominees except this and 'Cartel Land', but I certainly think this film has the edge to win the best Documentary film. Definitely Amy's life story deserves to be made as a feature film and I'm up for it. Because somewhere I read the reply to a question 'why Bill Gates is not celebrated as the Steve Jobs? After all bother of them achieved a lot in the same field and contributed to modernise the computer technology'.

The reply was like this: 'Bill Gates was from a financially well settled family who was good at studies and his life was very smooth, support was poured from all the corners. While Steve Jobs was a child of an immigrant parents and had to struggle for his achievements. So he went through many ups and downs in his life and people have soft corner for that'.

This film had all qualities to inspire from the Amy's achievement as well as lessons to learn from her personal life. Everybody has their personal issues and so the Amy. Becoming a prey for the drugs and alcohol is very common these days among the celebrities. For example Heath Ledger, Philip Seymour Hoffman and many other stars are the victims for the drug addiction.

That does not mean their achievements are nothing. Simply, we see one of the many faces of them. After all, we're humans go after what we desire for, but everything has limits, after that what comes is a self-destruction. It is a very nice movie. If you know her and still want to know better, and if you don't know her and want to know about her, for both it is a must see.

The footage is eye jarring and I am amazed that some people gave that to the film maker. I cannot criticize her because all of us got high in our younger days but none of us had millions of dollars and none of us were subject to the easy access or the constant public eye. I learned a lot about her that I did not know which helped me and the arrest of her husband will make you realize that everything revolved around money.

Granted, she was a big star, but there’s plenty of fascinating private footage from the years prior to that, from camcorders large and small.

Another striking aspect of the movie is how fine a film Kapadia has made, _desipte_ the wealth of footage available.  He does not yield to temptations to stray from his main concern--the conflict, as it were, between the woman and her music.  When she’s on, she lights herself up and everyone who’s with her, but it’s impossible to escape the realization that to Winehouse, music was a tool she used to stay sane—until she became a star and artistic success fed back negatively to her health and well-being. Kapadia has kept his treatment of the final years of Winehouse’s story both unsparing and unsentimental.  (To be fair, some family members, and a few critics, challenge Kapadia’s narrative.)

Kapadia’s film is a very stylish one, where dark and grainy passages seem to be as much an artistic choice as a technical constraint – and most of the time, we can still tell what’s going on!  He also helpfully floats the song lyrics across the screen.

This is a must-see for Winehouse fans (while the story is tragic, the film is not morose), and pop music aficionados in general as well as docu devotees will find lots to chew on."

Never have I ever watched a documentary so far that has made me feel very strong emotional feelings towards the end of the viewing of someone that I don’t even really know, nor followed during her rise to fame in the 2000’s. When a documentary can do this to you, you know you’ve watched an exceedingly well made documentary.
The documentary doesn’t try sugar coat what Winehouse was like and so through the mainly found footage Doc you can see what her character was like. She was obviously a very vulnerable and insecure person, but a real quirky and fun character that seemed to have what looked like no real malice at all within her. She definitely had attachment issues and because of this and her rise to **** – of which she did not really ask for – she went down the rocky path that she ended up on. Due to all of this you can see she had her faults, but really she was an average girl with an extremely incredible talent who wanted to be like everyone else; she didn’t want fame but the attention she got from her talent consumed her and ate away at her vulnerable core.
Asif Kapadia has done an incredible job on his selection of found footage, editing and storytelling through interviews that you can’t help but feel pretty sorry for Amy in the end, and really see what a shame and what a loss it was for her to go how she did. I’m not even sure if there was anyone in the viewing I went to who did not feel similar feelings.
Overall, Amy is possibly one of the best documentaries I can think of that I have watched, and I would recommend it to everyone whether they liked Amy of not, followed her through her album releases or have never really heard of her at all. An incredibly fascinating documentary that really will make you emotional.
Extra note, I just held in my man tears at the end of the film. Just.

This amazingly compiled documentary which utilises a significant amount of unique and personal footage, starts at the top and goes on and up supplying in minute detail information about the tragic star that was hither to unknown to me. Emerging somewhat damaged from a dysfunctional working class background and optimistically declaring that she was ‘not a messed up person, Amy’s vulnerability, shyness and penchant for cutting remarks tell an altogether different story.
The influences of both her husband and father, Blake Fielder and Mitch Winehouse respectively, are here clearly depicted as self-serving negative forces in her life. The former introduced her to the hard drugs that would assist her in pushing the self-destruct button, whilst the former was more concerned about his life style than the well- being of his troubled daughter.
Unusually this is not a documentary given over to talking heads. Instead we just hear the voices over filmed footage with titles informing us as to who is speaking and where the action is taking place. It makes for a refreshing change. Also, the brilliant decision to have the lyrics to her songs actually appear on screen as she is singing them adds volumes to our understanding of the singer, her demons and how she coped with them, albeit tragically.
Whilst the many unsavoury aspects of her life forces one to acknowledge that she could never be held up as a positive role model, her voice and talent were truly great. Her death at 27 was, under the circumstances, almost inevitable."

Went to see her 2007 Glastonbury performance when I was 12. I thought I knew just what kind of girl she was before her world got much darker. But I was struck by how little I actually knew about the whole picture after seeing Kapadia's documentary. She was bright-eyed, wise beyond her years and so loving to the people around her that the only person she could ever mistreat was herself. She truly had the most unadulterated relationship with music, something not every mainstream artist can claim these days. But like many other reviews have said, her story is much more complicated than that. Never openly placing the blame on any particular person or interest group, Kapadia keeps his/our gaze on the singer herself, allowing the audience to experience the world of Amy Winehouse through her own eyes. This intense focus on the subject makes the movie an engrossing and uncomfortable watch at the same time: on the one hand, we are delighted to witness on screen the unique mesmerising talent and the endearing, uninhibited personality that made Amy Winehouse tick; on the other, we are tormented by the gradual feeling of losing her again to depression, addiction and the unrelenting celebrity machine closing in on her. Even though the last twenty minutes of the film is almost unbearable and makes you hope the story would somehow end differently, you realise that deep down, the Amy you see toward the end of her life is still the same Amy all along --- her need for love and her capacity for loving those close to her had never diminished.

Commerce”.

‘Amy’ spans the colorful singer’s life from an upbringing that is blamed for her troublesome personality and vulnerability, to her refreshing early career as a Jazz singer with integrity all the way through her many personal issues with relationships and substance abuse, coinciding with her explosion of worldwide fame and everything that came with it.

Asif Kapadia has proved to be a supremely effective “compilation” documentarian, taking existing footage and combining it with techniques like striking “drone” aerial shots and audio-only interviews spliced with intimate photographs and scrolling song lyrics, the result is an unusually dynamic for a documentary and whatever your emotional response may be to the subject, it does make sure you respond.

With unprecedented access to her life and death, ‘Amy’ paints a picture of a uniquely talented young lady who’s strong-willed personality, formed by her childhood, also resulted in a vulnerability and self-destructive nature that was too much to bear when combined with the unwanted pressures of celebrity and the ruthless nature of the modern media.

Rather cleverly the audience is left to decide whether her death was avoidable if not for the demands of the music-industry-machine and actions of those around her, or whether this was just another of those inevitable tragedies with those who fly too close to the sun.

The Bottom Line…
‘Amy’ is powerful thought & emotion provoking work, a candid look at the troubled and ultimately tragic life of a prodigious talent and reluctant global superstar, an expertly crafted documentary from a director who’s quickly becoming a pro at capturing the beauty within tragedy."

641,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/birds-of-passage/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TrevorsView,"Jul 12, 2019",7,"Young Zaida gets markings on her face, then performs a coming-of-age dance inside a circle of spectators with her robe to the wind. This dance is called the “Yonna,” and is done to imitate the courtship ritual that some birds may take when it’s time to mate. She looks just like an elaborate sparrow that’s kicking the dust with her wings, while the man she’s about to face a lifetime of turmoil with is like the consequence of choosing the wrong mate.

Despite how untrue it is to the historical account, Birds of Passage draws you into the feeling of the illegal drug trade that happened in Colombia throughout the time of the Vietnam War. You feel like the world **** up your moral stability until you’re dry to the bone as the cicadas continually buzz from scene to scene. What keeps it all flowing so smoothly is that each scene starts with a visual idea of hope that connects with the tragic scene before, and it works vice-versa too. Whenever joy happens, tragedy follows, and whenever dismay happens, hope comes up for a moment before the heartbreaking finale. The theme of a plague approaching, both literally and metaphorically, keeps creeping closer to you as you experience the events deconstruct, a sense of dread you instantly comprehend when the main protagonist, Rapayet, watches a cricket on the ground.

There’s never a sigh of relief, the conflict continually closes you in like a dust cloud. Among the elements that cloud your vision of this feature, one is an actual cloud of dirt that obtrudes the foreground right before a horse race. That striking use of a dull brown color is the perfect offset for the use of green in the cinematography; here it symbolizes the color of greed, and since so much of what grows in Colombia is green, that means these people are seen as exploiting their own home for their garden of inanimate pesos. That’s why it’s so effective to have the locusts present: they feed on grass, so naturally, they are God’s way of judging these drug traders for their intense greed. They gain some, they lose all.

The actors put in the best they can offer to suggest intentional imbalance in their performances to give the strong feeling of losing all they have foolishly gained. That particularly goes to José Vicente, although he always wears sunglasses, you don’t need to see his eyes to turn uneasy like you’re supposed to as you watch him monologue. He, like the tone of the movie, is very slow moving, enough to help you notice the other objects of lust these people have submitted their greed to, including the necklaces that the women put tremendous spiritual value into.

But there are still the shortcomings too, particularly in this film’s treatment toward Americans, who are represented here by the Hippie movement. While it does say that they got their sights set on fighting communism, they don’t do much else for the Colombians besides party on the beach and purchase their weed. There really should have been more done to give these Hippies something valuable to say in this otherwise profound film that everyone in Colombia sould see. Even then, the immediate social relevance of this motion picture may not strike hard and true to everyone living in Colombia with its incredibly slow pace. Not enough is done to stir as much of a reaction from the viewer, including a bizarre moment when a man eats a banana peel. One of the bigger instances of sparking distance, particularly between the families of the story, is splitting the narrative into “songs,” which ultimately wasn’t necessary.

Then there’s the biggest issue of all, its complete disregard to what really happened. It’s not actually a true story like it says, and several reseachers have already proved so. You probably didn’t need me to tell you that though, because there are issues in simple logic that are kind of hard to overlook, the most glaring of all being the simple fact that Zaida never ages after the fifteen-plus years this film portrays. I guess that means you could say Colombia picked the wrong submission for the Foreign Language Film Oscar, not that it was the worst choice, but they could have done better.

Instead, the movie’s focus is on the visual impact. There’s rain that mists the landscape to make you think the road ahead has only despair ready. A plane burial reminds you of what man can create and uncreate just as easily. A storm of locusts frightens you when the despair finally hits with what man can neither create nor uncreate.

That’s what I guarantee you’ll get from experiencing Birds of Passage, you’ll want to cover your face as you mourn how low these men are willing to go for greed, even to the level of a dog. The great cry this memorial service of a cinematic meditation wants you to partake in will allow you to soar over those who want to fly but haven’t given time to grow into their wings."

Unlike any gangster/drug movie you've ever seen, Pájaros de verano (Birds of Passage) is from the same team that made the astonishing Embrace of the Serpent (2015), and presents a thematically similar narrative, looking at the disintegration of an indigenous culture over a period of years; in this case, the Wayúu of northern Colombia, whose way of life is decimated by the marijuana trade in the 1970s. Written by Maria Camila Arias and Jacques Toulemonde Vidal from a story by Cristina Gallego, and directed by Gallego and Ciro Guerra, the film is partly an ethnographic study and partly a genre film depicting the rise and fall of a drug kingpin á la Scarface (1983).

Loosely based on a true story, Pájaros opens in a Wayúu village in 1968, with a ceremony celebrating the coming of age of Zaida (Natalia Reyes). When Rapayet (José Acosta) makes a claim on her, her mother Úrsula (Carmiña Martínez) assigns him a dowry far beyond his means. However, he and his business partner Moisés (Jhon Narváez) start selling weed to the local American Peace Corp, and he quickly makes enough to secure the dowry. Three years later, Rapayet and the increasingly hot-headed and reckless Moisés are flying planeloads of weed across the border, making so much money they have to weigh it rather than count it. However, as time passes, and the business grows, so too do the tensions between the various players, compounded by Úrsula's cruel and uncontrollable son Leonídas (Greider Meza).

Pájaros begins and ends with a blind bard narrating the events. Taken directly from the Homeric tradition, the presence of this figure immediately indicates the kind of story this is; a grand, folkloric tale of national significance.

Using the genre template as a platform from which to examine the clash between Wayúu tradition and the ubiquitous and corruptive nature of monetary accruement in the twentieth-century world at large, Guerra and Gallego are more concerned with the impact of the drug trade on the Wayúu than the drug trade itself. Although proud of how deep their customs run and how long they have maintained them, the Wayúu's nonconformist and isolationist ideology has never faced anything as insidious as the avarice introduced by Rapayet. Just how corruptive it is, is seen in Leonídas, a boy who has grown up amidst amorality, corruption, and crime, and whose soul is built on entitlement. In the film's most disturbing scene, to ""prove"" his manhood to his friends, he forces a man to eat dog faeces for money. Nothing in Wayúu history has ever prepared them for this level of barbarism.

In this sense, Pájaros is about how codes of honour and reciprocity are destroyed by greed, materialism, and mistrust. In depicting the society before the birth of the drug trade, Gallego and Guerra are trying to reclaim Colombia's history for Colombians. All a lot of people know about Colombia comes from films made almost exclusively by non-Colombians for non-Colombians (think of Americentrist films such as Blow, The Infiltrator, and American Made). The film thus has an anthropological basis, immersing us in Wayúu culture throughout and illustrating the centrality of family, the respect for the natural world, the reverence for the dead, the significance of communal ritual, and above all, honour.

The film makes its intentions known in the opening scene, which is built around Zaida's ceremony, just as The Godfather (1972) indicates its main focus with the opening depiction of a wedding. This scene is contrasted with a later one depicting a ""second burial"", which is surrounded by men with machine guns; a nice bit of cinematic shorthand to show us how much has changed. In another example, after doing something to anger a rival clan, Leonídas is hidden away in a hut, and Úrsula performs a protective incantation as he complains that he'd be happier if he was protected by men with guns.

In terms of problems, there are a few. For one, Rapayet is extremely stoic and very vaguely defined. He doesn't really come across as a person with an interiority, and often feels like a cypher at the mercy of what the writers need him to be at any given moment. Zaida fares even worse. Despite the opening scene suggesting her centrality, once she and Rapayet are married, she essentially becomes a background extra.

These issues notwithstanding, Pájaros de verano tells the story of a traditional culture decimated by greed. Making a powerful statement about what has been lost, Gallego and Guerra handle the integration of ethnographic study and genre film very well, with the movie serving as an excellent example of how to use genre to serve thematic ends without necessarily making a genre film. Neither a thriller with some local details thrown on top nor a documentary with a manufactured dramatic structure, Pájaros is compelling and heartfelt throughout."

These indigenous tribes are steeped in sacred traditions and mythical culture, so their embrace of this new commercial endeavor is gradual and destructive. Instead of being loaded with drug movie tropes (although there is some of that), this film is an intimate examination of how a tribe, especially one family, is affected. It moves at an unhurried pace, basking in the customs of this world. Although there are dramatic events, their reactions are more resigned to tragedy instead of grand emotion.

""Birds of Passage"" affords a very bold look at the brutal Colombian illegal drug trade, disregarding any pre-established reference from well-known productions such as Netflix's TV series ""Narcos"" or ""Loving Pablo"" by Fernando León de Aranoa; in lieu, builds a tale of hierarchies, revenge, obsession and justice on this setting, through appealing indigenous characters the story handles under the condition of narrative coherence. Plus, it takes advantage of the Wayuu tribe to unfold events as magnificently shot as told, which allows witnessing a rustic character study instead of another violence-packed drug cartel-set story, necessary ingredients, but subordinated by the surprising turns arising from every new chapter.

It deploys the routinely poisonous gangster film ""rise,"" from challenging poverty to naked greed by means of non-indie devices re-adapted delightfully under a Colombian prism. Keeping alive the reason of his underhand glory (to win the hand of his wife), it's even more enticing to experience the corresponding fall glued to the protagonist, a loss the thickest wad of bills cannot make up for.

Screenwriting duo Jacques Toulemonde Vidal and Maria Camila Arias seem to understand well how to set up and how to keep in motion this parable by means of the personalized division into chapters or dream sequences strengthening the storytelling in critical moments. The script has a simple shell that galvanizes the audience for certain periods with unexpectedly disturbing scenes, however, if you're willing to dive in, Guerra can catch you off guard. The emulsion between '80s crime film and the director's personal vision makes it resist to define itself as a piece of art cinema, not only due to its effective twists, but its expertise leaving time to both filmmaking styles.  Admittedly, violence was unavoidable dealing with three flammable components: drug trafficking, money, and betrayal. Fortunately, the script knows how to handle it with strong underpinnings, it isn't a simple entertainment incentive for moviegoers. Death is meaningful if it represents support for the story to move forward, every shot, every bullet, every blow plays a role and, nowadays, justified film violence is a gift. As a good violence-packed feature film, said scenes are used purposefully and coherently, two non-existent attributes in many indie and mainstream films. Latin American culture has been frivolously explored by film, thus, it's priceless the way the film develops, drawing together the Colombian indigenous panorama and the most aggressive narrative frenzy in order to encourage audiences to stay in. In addition to the unbending hierarchical structures most of the South America indigenous cultures are based on, the film delivers a pressing commentary through the Wayuu traditions, humanizing those who are currently marginalized by a social system resisting progress. Cinematographer David Gallego has shown me one exceptional work and other amazingly well-crafted to date: ""Embrace of the Serpent"" and ""Siete Cabezas."" One more time, he teams up with the first Colombian filmmaker ever to give his country an Oscar nomination, this time, in an entirely different location. Gallego's cinematography for his two previous productions, especially the first one, must be appreciated because of achieving visually meaningful frames with hints of magnificence is hard work. It takes advantage of coming-of-age dances, ceremonies, marriages, funerals, and folklore to let free the most creative authenticity, discreetly dominated by a grateful modesty, no bombastic ambition, on the contrary, every feature, prominently colors, matches in an effervescent way. Gallego delivers some dream pictures in this film, beautifully imposing that seize the screen, purified by glorious naturalness.  Leonardo Heiblum's score is brilliant. **** bass drums and folkloric indigenous flutes ahead, the composer captures the sounds of a culture and the story's leitmotif, fusing primitive sounds with delightful compositions that empower all the movie and causing a deeper, sharper effect in the viewer; a composer to keep an eye on.

""Birds of Passage"" by Ciro Guerra and Cristina Gallego isn't another take on narcotrafficking, is a violent, occasionally overwhelming parable that deals with such ancestral issues as justice, greed, betrayal and excesses; a vivid, bold portrait of the ghosts of a country that throws cold water on its present yet. Here another strong feature film from duo filmmakers Guerra-Gallego duo that recognizes them as tightly skilled directors and one of the figureheads of their country. This film hits hard in Colombian filmography, dealing with sensitive issues and the sins and name of an indigenous culture that deserves to be known and respected."

A recurring fear in the main character that never really shows motives, although it's taken as a cliché that all Japanese are like that abroad.
But even so, most of this film simply but neatly constructs an absorbing character study. Certainly it depends a lot on the amount in which you can identify with the protagonist, but I feel that even if you do not make a connection with her, her journey is understandable and I think that more than one can feel sympathy for her feeling of unease in a foreign place, where everyone looks at you and identify you as an outsider. It doesn't ground all the concepts it develops, and some argument lines feel artificial for the sake of drama (the fire in Tokyo, and her concern for her boyfriend) but stays steady most of the time, and flows gracefully if not effortlessly."

Yoko, una joven reportera japonesa (Atsuko Maeda, actriz y cantante pop) y su equipo recorren Uzbekistán para un programa de viajes de la TV japonesa.
La película de Kishoyi Kurosawa tiene bastante de inclasificable. Es un drama, pero con momentos de comedia, algunos de ellos perturbadores, con Yoko pasando por varias situaciones incómodas y a veces insólitas. Hasta los confines… es una película impredecible que sorprende a cada rato con los avatares de su protagonista, con sus consiguientes y necesarios cambios de registro. A pesar de ello, la película conserva su coherencia de principio a fin, en parte por la figura de su protagonista, frágil pero curiosa y resuelta.
Ciertos choques culturales, las diferencias de criterio con su equipo, su férreo y tenaz profesionalismo, las vocaciones postergadas y los sueños de Yoko se suman a un registro casi documental de las exóticas locaciones por las que transitan que nunca cae en el pintoresquismo.

English Review
Yoko, a young Japanese reporter (Atsuko Maeda, actress and pop singer) and her team travel to Uzbekistan for a Japanese TV travel program.

Kishoyi Kurosawa's film is quite unclassifiable. It's a drama, but with moments of comedy, some of them disturbing, with Yoko going through various awkward and sometimes unusual situations. Up to the End ... is an unpredictable film that surprises at all times with the vicissitudes of the protagonist of it, with the consequent and necessary changes of registry of her. Despite this, the film retains its coherence from beginning to end, in part because of the figure of her protagonist, fragile but curious and determined.

Certain cultural clashes, the differences of opinion with her team, her iron and tenacious professionalism, the postponed vocations and Yoko's dreams add to an almost documentary record of the exotic locations through which they pass that never falls into the picturesqueness."

Ash Is Purest White

The writer and director Zhangke Jia is a, if I may, a sadistic person when it comes to portray love in cinema. And there's nothing wrong with that. You can see the result here. It is just, personally I feel sobered up when I start jumping on this train. Now, this is not just any ""sober""-ness that he offers us. It is a post hangover, too many cups of coffee, sober. What it sums up too, is an experience. An experience of a lifetime? Sure, why not. For if the writing and direction of the film is pretty standard. What Jia has achieved in this passionate project of his, is something I haven't seen before.

And maybe, I will remember it years later, for its originality. Or just freshness, in my life. Over the two hours in our world, and more than 15 years in the character's world, Jia defines love. Now, there have been so many filmmakers, storytellers, philosophers and whatnots that had tried to conjure the essence of what love is. Where some has been so theoretical and meticulous and a bit math about their love, some has been awfully blunt in their grammar.

And maybe this one comes in later or maybe in both of them. Jia describes it disproportionately. The writers, before him, have gone through enormous lengths to justify it, balance it and share it as much as they could. And even if this one shares its share inadvertently, it is also never called upon. This leaves a hollow space in your head. You are numb for the rest of the day when you get in contact with this. Ash Is Purest White, it concludes, pretty early on, and by the last bell is rung, you'd wish for some, some filter in their voices."

654,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-treasure/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"Feb 4, 2018",8,"Not your typical treasure hunt film!

Who doesn't like treasure hunt films. They are always exciting with surprises. See this film poster, and the title is just perfect. That's what I expected, like if not another 'Indiana Jones', then 'National Treasure'. I was disappointed with that perspective. But realised it was unique with the most realistic approach. I've seen plenty of same themed films, but this one stood out to be one of the rare kind. This film is not fun as the others, but surely makes sense of what real treasure hunt means. Though the film did not take the complicated route to narrate the tale. Just a simple, small film.

A man from a little middle-class family living in an apartment is approached by his neighbour guy who financially broke. All he wanted was some cash, so that he could go and look for treasure that his dying grandfather told him about. Now these two join hands for the unusual quest. They had to make all the pre-arrangement before jumping into it. Like hiring a metal detector and making it a weekend event for not clashing with their routines. So finally the most expected venture begins and how it all turns out are told with some fun filled tense climax.

This is a very slow film. Particularly those treasure hunt sequences became even slower than what one would expect out of it. Probably a film for matured audience. It is considered as a black comedy and yes, that's how everything unfolded. Though not all black comedies are same. I mean not everybody understands clearly why it is called that.

In my instance, I expected something else, but got another thing. In the end, I really enjoyed it. The initial story was unbelievable. I mean, if somebody approached me with a theory like that, not just me, most of the people won't easily want to be a part of it. Not because it is illegal, but does not make sense or gives enough reason to take part. It has to be convinced thoroughly.

❝We've all got problems. You've got problems. I've got problems. A man makes his own problems. They don't descend from heaven.❞

The little Robin Hood story at the opening was relevant to how the film has ended. That character called Costi was an ideal man for a typical world. His belief to be a good person in the society, definitely gives the right message. But I did not think he would go for such a quest. That's the first twist. Then following that, seeing his desperate to succeed, more than the man who took him in, it kind of made fun, like of course black comedy. Especially during the hunt, the verbal fight between two out of three set a perfect tone for the rest of the tale.

Definitely not a predictable storyline. That's what kept my eyes open, despite frequent drops in the pace of the narration. I liked the dialogues, especially about the some of the technical terms. Like about metal detector, and the brief history about the Romanian communist era, including the Dos and Don'ts, what the law says about the treasures that has found. It was not like you take all the needed tools and the adventure begins. It excellently highlighted that the treasure hunt is not like one you have seen in the films.

Finally, regarding the treasure, it comes in many forms. How this film sorted out that part was really cool. That's indeed a well written screenplay. It's not impossible to see such a film in Hollywood, but they won't make money, that's the difference. That is the reason why small film industries around the world shines with such little gems. This is the reason I want to explore the world cinema.

When it comes to the development, in some of the parts, the film was not that logical. That's how it has to go, so it became what it is. As I said the end was really cool. I meant the post quest end. It had ended bringing a little smile on my face. Nice performances. The writer, director is the first to be appreciated. I haven't seen many Romanian films, but from those I've seen never disappointed, and so this one, a very satisfying film. My little advise is for those who wants to see it is expect it to be a drama than an action-adventure- thriller. Patience is another thing it required. Probably you would like it after watched it than while watching. But overall a worthy film.

The existence of this film evolved almost by serendipity.  Zhao was in South Dakota, with intention of making an entirely different film, featuring the lifestyle of  Native Americans of the area, including Brady Landreau.  But when Brady (main character in The Rider) actually suffered a serious head injury in a rodeo bull riding event, she changed focus of the film to be about Brady and his family and friends.  The story is  authentic and real, bringing the viewer into the characters' lives with complete empathy.  Life is tough for young Lakota Natives, with few economic opportunities.  The rodeo, and particularly its most dangerous event -- bull riding -- is one of the only ways they can work, rather than farming very difficult  territory.  Brady is a horse-whisperer, who can tame even the most skittish horses.  So the title refers not only to his experience as a bull rider, but also about his relationship with horses, and his almost magical abilities with them.  Brady's charisma, quiet nobility, and determination carry the story through to a surprising and satisfying ending. His life motto is ""cowboy up,"" meaning ""no matter how hard things are, you can face life with courage and dignity.""  But the film is not at all sentimental in its telling.  Rather, it draws you into Brady's life in a deeply experiential and tender way.  Although the story is presented as fictional, the players are the actual people being depicted in the movie. I was so impressed with Brady, both the actor and the character, that I've adopted his ""cowboy up"" attitude to see me through rough spots.  When a film has the capacity to change your thinking, or your life, you realize it has more depth and wisdom than most films, including Nomadland.  The Rider -- one of the best films of the past 10 years."

I liked the sound of the hooves on the ground - the rustling of the grass and the crickets, plus, of course, the ocassional great landscape panoramic type shots, including some pretty sunsets. I imagine it looked really quite impressive on the big screen - its certainly atmospheric in any case.

Its one of those films in which at times the lack of dialogue makes it stand out - in which its whats not said that perhaps means, or counts, more than what is. In that sense its about isolation and I appreciated that aspect of it.

I thought Brady Jandreau did good portraying the main character,  Brady Blackburn - he's quite facially expressive and its relatively easy to tell, or guess, what he may be thinking at any time. Also his pure love of rodeo, of being a cowboy etc. comes across quite genuinely. His sister, Lilly, is quite clearly developmentally challenged (if thats an acceptable phrase to use these days?) and I thought it was quite touching how he interacts with her. The film is based on a true story, that of the actor Brady Jandreau, which gives it even more meaning and substance, I feel. There's a Q&A on the Blu-Ray of this film, in which the actor talks about his experience.

There is a lot of love and compassion as well as determinism expressed, visually if not verbally. Its also about identity including masculinity. It captures exhilaration quite well, I felt, with a good use of music - a moody instrumental piece played at the end. I very much enjoyed this film and so I would definitely recommend it."

The Rider

Zhao's pathos drama that eerily is of an antithetical nature, proposes a much bigger question that every being lives for or has lived for. The theme somewhat resonates with Coen Brothers's Inside Llewyn Davis, only a bit less darker, but equally promising and inspiring. This character driven feature dwells upon the inner resistance of ones- drunken with oneself's attraction or weakness towards a subject and the conscience practical decision towards right and wrong- this is a film that required a narrator or an inner monologue. But Zhao's bold steps on not to keep one favors immensely on her side through her brilliant execution, these silent pitches where she milks out the essential drama remains the highlight of it.

And through brilliant performance and meticulous script that uses enough props to express views and intentions, the message is sound and clear. Another beautiful aspect of the feature is the interaction of our protagonist with horses, the way he tames and communicates with them, it doesn't require any verbal sparring to mesmerize you. And fabricating this drama into a compelling action, is Jandreau, delivering a stellar performance to observe at.

To be fair, his character is much more endearing than our usual protagonist is, he helps his friends even at their worst, he is protective and open to alienated concepts. The only part where he gets to be edgy and depict a darker side of his, is when he wrestles with a friend of his, which too is justified thoroughly. The conversations and the activities going around the room or a house is pretty much mundane and pragmatic that denses up the essence of the stakes stronger and impenetrable, like the usual conflict of his younger sister with her family that is kept burning throughout the course of the film. The Rider rides with an even stable pace to a more cozy state than it begins with."

Partly an elegy for a dissipating way of life, partly an examination of the self-destructive components of contemporary masculinity, and partly a deconstruction of the iconography of the American frontier, The Rider is the second film from Chinese-American writer/director Chloé Zhao. The film tells the loosely fictionalised story of rodeo rider Brady Jandreau, who sustained a serious cranial injury in a rodeo accident, and was told by doctors that he must give up the only way of life he had ever known, as another blow to the head could kill him. Working with an entirely non-professional cast, including the real Jandreau, his father, sister, and several of his friends, all playing versions of themselves, The Rider is a kind of semi-fictional docudrama, and one of the finest films of the year.

In depicting Brady's struggle with trying to lead a 9-to-5 life, Zhao is able to simultaneously romanticise and demythologise the role of the cowboy in the contemporary United States, and as the story progresses, the film comes to express a sense of disillusionment with the lifestyle. Part of this is the theme of the rodeo itself. So eloquently panegyrised in the early parts of the film, it is also presented as leading to physical ruin and mental anguish. Brady and his friends are personifications of the ruggedness of the American West, and the film uses them to facilitate a deconstruction of contemporary masculinity. They see themselves as modern day-cowboys, but in an era where cowboys serve no function. In relation to this, it's extremely telling that literally every male Brady meets expresses desire that he start riding again, although many know why he stopped. On the other hand, one of the few female characters tells him, ""problem with you boys, you don't like to get your pride hurt"".

However, whilst the film leaves the audience in little doubt that this lifestyle can lead to ruin, so too Zhao has the deepest respect for these guys, depicting, as it does, the kind of desperation and limited choices that leave a young man with only one route forward in life. Never once does it feel like she is looking down on or satirising them. Rather, she is criticising the situation in which they find themselves.

The most telling example of this is Lane (Lane Scott). As with the real Brady, Lane was a celebrated rodeo and the embodiment of machismo, with a devil-may-care attitude. However, as in the film, the real Lane is now almost completely paralysed, capable of communicating only by signing with his left hand. The only difference between the real-life Lane and his fictional counterpart is that in reality, he was paralysed in a car crash, whereas in the film it was via riding. This differentiation is telling as it speaks to Zhao's thematic intent.

In a sense, whilst the film partially recalls The Misfits (1961), its real thematic precursor is The Wrestler (2008), an examination of male pride working against common sense, of professional dedication, of machoism gone awry. As with The Wrestler, the story of The Rider is archetypal. The Wrestler could have been about any sport, and The Rider is even more universal; it could have been literally about any environ in which a young man tries to balance the dangers of what he does with the possibility of a reward at the end of it all.

Aesthetically, the film opens with a shot of a horse during a storm, followed by loud thunder. The immediate impression is one of elemental forces. This is immediately contrasted with Brady waking up and heading into a dingy bathroom to pluck off the staples holding the bandage on his still raw head wound. Thus, in just two shots, Zhao sets up the entire thematic purpose of the film - poetic rhetoric and romantic myths are all very well and good, but the day-to-day is so often ugly and mundane.

Elsewhere, the centrepiece of the film is a single-take shot where Brady breaks in an ""untrainable"" horse. The gentle approach he employs, the constant reassurances to the animal, the way he holds the rope, how he gets the horse used to someone on its back without actually getting all the up, his grace and intuition, his confidence; the totality is achingly perfect. You can't teach this kind of natural skill. Indeed, his gentle approach itself is completely at variance with such scenes in other westerns, where we're usually shown someone breaking in a horse by forcing it to respect them.

Bleak but incredibly beautiful, honest but deeply respectful, realistic but profoundly poetic, Zhao's depiction of a dying culture - the adrenaline-junkie bronco riders, America's modern cowboys - is easily one of the finest films of the year. And how ironic is it that one of the best examinations of American masculinity that you're likely to see is written and directed by a woman? And a woman born in China to boot. That's sure to irritate the misogynists/xenophobes no end!"

Brady Jandreau's acting is so genuine and honest.
There are some truly great moments that will make you instantly engaged with every character in them. I don't even want to say anything about these scenes, I don't even want to mention the characters they include, because they are unbelievably effective and very poignant.
The movie's message of perseverance and determination also should be considered and appreciated.

The grave issue I have with this movie is its tone.
I love character-driven stories, because they make me close to the main character. In other words, they put me in the protagonist's shoes, or even make me inside his mind. But The Rider's tone is so lifeless, and the story is almost uneventful. Of course, the movie should reflect the gloominess and bleakness of its subject matter, but the tone doesn't pick up even when the story do. Add to that, the movie lacks in dramatic intensity. Aside from some very touching scenes that can break your heart even if you haven't seen the entire film, the movie is so boring and phlegmatic. Honestly, I was bored most of the time while watching it. The dialogue also could have been better. it's so weak and clichéd.

All the performances are good, especially Brady Jandreau as Brady Blackburn, except for the actor who played his dad. His acting is very weak as his bland and flat character.

I had mixed feelings about The Rider. I found it monotonous, and I was bored to death. Nevertheless, I cared about the main character and almost every character around it, I appreciated its message, I was fascinated by its stunning cinematography, and I adored its tear-jerking ending.

This question works especially well for films with characters and storylines that are not entirely new but are rather adding a new flavor to existing ideas. The question is not meant to be an insult to the film: in fact, I really only think of the question when a newer film seems to be heading in a predictable and uninteresting direction but then takes an unexpected (or at least unconventional) turn into a new experience. It is easy for a novice filmmaker to find a camera and a few dollars and put together a low-budget picture, which makes it much more special when one of these filmmakers (Chloé Zhao) does just that and produces a work like The Rider that turns out to be one of the strongest films of its year.

Zhao's modern cowboy tale takes place in the badlands in South Dakota. The landscape is a character in The Rider, not unlike what the Coen brothers establish in films like No Country for Old Men and Fargo. Our lead character, Brady, deals with isolation; he lives with his drunk, unloving father and moderately autistic sister. Brady loves his family (and in fact demonstrates genuine gentleness and a general respect for living creatures around him in his interactions throughout the film) but cannot relate to them due to his excellence at and obsession with riding and training horses. His passion, however, is severely restrained by his recent head injury. Not only does Brady suffer permanent repercussions from his skull fracture, but he also rides under a cloud of dread knowing that another head injury could kill or severely handicap him. The question constantly occupies Brady's existence: is it worth risking his life doing what he loves most?

Zhao has managed to create a contemplative picture that puts its faith in the audience to ask the right questions. A bad movie would advertise the ""rodeo of the year!"" on some banner in town and show Brady training in a Rocky-like montage to overcome his head injury and win the big prize against some bully of an opponent. The Rider is so much more respectful of its audience and chooses to focus on character rather than sensationalism. There are no ""bad guys"" but rather people living their lives the way they know best. This film focuses on passion and its ability to drive a person too far. Suspense hangs in the air every time Brady mounts a horse knowing that it could be his last ride. He does not care; Brady is sure of his calling.

Summer blockbusters are fun and whimsical, but films like The Rider carry a much longer lasting personal impact than montages of car chases and one-liners. It is rare for a film to truly pierce the soul and shake the viewer from the core, elevating from entertainment to transformation, but The Rider comes pretty close to doing just that."

As he begins to recover, he deals with the possibility that he'll never be able to compete again. By the end, it's become an intimate and compassionate portrait of this sweet, talented man. What makes this even more compelling is that the cast is full of non-actors, including Jandreau, his real-life father and his sister, who has Asperser's Syndrome. Their performances are all real and affecting. The scenes where Jandreau trains wild horses are especially fascinating. The creation of this specific cowboy world is made even more involving thanks to Chinese director Chloé Zhao's quiet observations and compelling use of real people (primarily Lakota Sioux).  This is an atmospheric and ultimately touching character study set in a unique culture."

I didn't watch a trailer for it, and I didn't read anything about it beforehand. All I had seen was the poster for it that my local indie theater had out in the lobby, which claimed that it had won several Spirit awards. From the poster, all I really gathered is that it was about a cowboy. I didn't know that it was loosely based on a true story, or that the people from that true story played themselves in the film, or that it was directed by a Chinese filmmaker. And I'm glad that I didn't. If I had never found out that the people from the real life story played themselves in this film (which I found out shortly after watching it), I would have continued to think that regular actors were in this film. The acting by the main family, and the others involved, is very, very good considering they aren't actors. They're just people that lived an interesting story. Very impressive. The Rider is a Western, but not in the traditional sense. There is no action, there is no grand adventure, but there is, in a sense, a journey. The film begins shortly after Brady gets injured in a rodeo accident. It shows his road to recovery, and everything he has to deal with. It shows how he deals with the prospect of having to give up the only thing he's ever really done, and how heartbreaking the that can be for someone. It's a story that is fairly balanced between hopefulness and sadness, with a little hint of happiness. The only real problem I have with The Rider is that the first third of the film didn't hook me at all. I was starting to lose some interest by the time the second act rolled around, but then it hooked me, and it hooked me hard. I was at full attention for the remainder of the film. But, the first act is still fairly weak, which brought my final score of the film down from the 9.0 or so it probably would have gotten otherwise. The cinematography in this film is bloody excellent. The director made sure to insert various scenic shots throughout the film, all of which are beautiful and really cement in your mind that this is a Western film. Overall, I think that The Rider is going to go down as one of my favorite films of the year. I look forward to watching it again in the future."

Last week I saw ""Lean On Peter"" which was a story about a boy and a horse also sad but with a Hollywood ending that just didn't fit. (Where is Elizabeth Taylor and ""National Velvet"" when you need them?)

The first startling thing about ""The Rider"", though not really known, is that it is based on a true story and includes the lead, his father, (Tim Jandreau) a man's man who finds it hard to express his love for his son and is also a man who has settled for less. His sister, Lilly (Lilly Jandreau) mentally challenged who clearly worships her brother and best friend, who have never acted before playing movie versions of themselves and all excellent, believable and honest as far as the audience can tell. Brady (Brady Jandreau) is a man with a dream who discovers he may not have that dream due to a severe injury when a horse stomped on his head in a rodeo. He sees the result of what can happen if he continues every time he visits his best friend Lane (the real Lane Scott) who can no longer speak or walk, is paralyzed and will likely spend the rest of his life institutionalized because of his rodeo life. The scenes between Brady and Lane are both sad and uplifting. We follow Brady as he clearly wants to get back into the rodeo life but while he is recovering he spends time training horses for which he seems to have a natural instinct for, almost as if he is a 'horse whisperer', especially for one horse called Apollo. We see what he wants to do and what he can do and whether he will have to compromise with his life. There is a lot of drama in following how and why Brady comes to the decision he does but it is more of the solving the mystery of the man than in 'dramatic' scenes, except, possibly, two scenes between him and his father.

In a way ""The Rider"" seems to be a look in the past but is still alive in South Dakota where the movie was filmed. His friends are cowboys as they are imagined by the audience but real. They drink, sit around campfires, play guitars, trade stories, pick on, care for and tease each other. You don't know if they are actors playing real people or real people acting in being themselves.

Chloe Zhao, the director/screenwriter of ""The Rider"" is a Chinese woman who lives in Colorado and has fallen in love with the people and the scenery of South Dakota, the latter photographed by Joshua James Richard. There is no debating of the beauty of that part of the country but the editor, Alex O'Flynn, allowed Zhao two too many moon and mountain shoots, too many plains scenes and, yes, as beautiful as they may be, too many similar horse scenes, slowing the movie down when they could have been cut without harming the movie, making it tighter. Is Brady Jandreau as stoic, as natural looking, as deep thinking in real life as he is in the movie?

Though I am sure there were no animals harmed in the making of the picture do we really have to see the skinning of a rabbit? There are 4-5 scenes of graphic injury to humans and animals, which are part of the life these people leave but it isn't necessary to show them and can just be indicated.

""The Rider"" is a movie that caused a lot of the audience to talk to each other in the lobby and more than one asked about where it was filmed (didn't catch it in the credits) while many discussed the director. The most common question was, ""What is Brady doing today?""

Along with all the questions and comments the audience tended to agree it was a sad and depressing movie but a powerful one."

This is also a ""docu-drama"" based on a true story, with the actual people who this happened to playing themselves! That honestly makes it even more of an incredible film!

To understand the film properly, the viewer must know that in 2016 Brady was thrown from the horse he was riding and kicked in the head by its hoof. He had a metal plate inserted in his head and was told that he would never ride again. This real life drama was witnessed by filmmaker Chloe Zhao who at the time was on the Pine Ridge Oglala Lakota Reservation directing her film “Songs My Brothers Taught Me”.    Ms. Zhao then wrote and directed the story of Brady Jandreau’s ability to cope with and seek to override the debilitating disability he suffered in his rodeo mishap. What is so unique about this film is that, not only Brady, but his real life sister (mentally underdeveloped 15 year old Lily) and his father, Tim, non-actors all, play themselves in this deep and involved story of life in the mid-west and especially those career cowboys whose lives exist on horseback or bulls, depending on the rodeo event they are in. In addition to the Jandreaus, the film employs the friends of the family including Lane Scott, who plays himself, a rodeo rider severely injured in an automobile accident which not only ended his career but left him a quadrapalegic.    Brady Jandreau’s performance is outstanding and hard to reconcile with the fact that this non-actor, playing himself, could give such a meaningful portrayal of how a cowboy who knew only horseback riding can find his way back to adjust and survive with the difficult hand he was dealt.    Ms. Zhao’s sensitivity and skill is manifested, not only in the ability to elicit such beautiful performances from her novice cast but to capture the sunrises and sunsets of the Dakota territory where the movie and real life events actually occurred. I give this film a 9.0 and urge that it be seen by all who can appreciate that truth can be much more awesome  and powerful than fiction."

Ellie did a fantastic job in the 8th grade role she was cast in by Bo. This article, which is not a movie, takes a chilly look at the risks and social awkwardness of growing up in the technological era, where increased sexuality and stimulation are prevalent in youth culture.

Eighth Grade is all at once harrowing, hilarious, grim, hopeful, lonely, joyous, a cutting portrait of the toxic relationship between technology and today's youth, and a beautiful character piece taking place in the worst time period of adolescence. While funny in that trademark eccentric, Bo Burnham style, so many scenes are very uncomfortable and are quite scary in fact! The emotional tone set by the shots and performances in this film are incredibly strong. As for Elsie Fisher, this is a breakout performance and she truly carries the movie on her shoulders. The critique of youth and technology is very well made, with such uncomfortably funny scenes such as kids not taking a school shooting drill seriously, or the fact that they are all isolating themselves in the depths of the internet will hit close to home for a lot of viewers. As much as things change, they stay the same however, as sex and **** are recurring topics in this movie. Sex is portrayed as both awkward, disgusting, and in one beautifully constructed scene in the back of a car, terrifying and predatorial.

Bo Burnham has made an excellent first film. Elsie Fisher carries herself and this film with intense vulnerability and grace. I will not be surprised if I see Eighth Grade popping up in the awards season this year"

I may have gone in thinking about Bo Burnham, and I very much suggest that you don’t make that mistake. Bo is an incredible writer besides being a very funny comedian, and I expected the writing to be a lot funnier than it ended up being. But that was okay in the end, as I had to continue watching for many other reasons. Elsie Fisher has incredible talent, that goes beyond anything I could have expected. By the end of the movie, she made me feel anxious and introverted through her acting, despite me being a fairly extroverted person. The awkwardness through this movie may not feel good at all, but it’s due to genius acting and writing that we are able to feel it. Overall I’m extremely impressed by the movie, and suggest it greatly. If you, however, are looking for a funny, lay low movie, you will never find it here in Eighth Grade by Bo Burnham."

A juventude nunca foi tão complexa. O longa de Bo Burnham tem o difícil trabalho de transpor a realidade de muitos jovens de uma maneira que não só quem simpatiza os possa entender. A discussão quanto ao ""seu eu"", inicio precoce da vida sexual, isolamento social - devido as personalidades toxicas que encontramos no podre ensino fundamental- e ansiedade são muito bem retratadas aqui. Não há um apelo significativo para o drama. Na verdade, levei esse filme mais como uma reflexão do que tudo.

A interpretação de Elsie Fisher estava precisa. O vocabulário, modo de se expressar, gírias, ansiedade e aquelas cenas cujo seus sentimentos se resumiam aos seus olhos fizeram uma baita diferença. Josh Hamilton também chamou minha atenção no papel pai. Gostei muito da atenção que o diretor teve ao distinguir a visão da protagonista com a real - aquela que só percebemos com devida distancia temporal."
692,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/eighth-grade/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Offworld_Colony,"Feb 19, 2020",10,"A really artistically sure and universally relatable film for all ages that manages to not feel low budget and is both of it's time (more than any film I've ever seen) and also timeless in its themes.

Beyond the obvious and initial reads about social media based on legend Bo Burnham, Eighth Grade manages to cover a hell of a lot of topics revolving around being on the cusp of adulthood and finding who you are, your boundaries and how to like yourself.

The YouTube segments are brilliant, as well as all the authentic social media presence and representation in the film, but moreover they are a brilliant device to allow Kayla to speak to herself, something which is evident part way through the film; as she discovers who and how she wants to be. Elsie Fisher is sublime, she delivers simultaneously one of the funniest performances and one of the most empathetic and realistic performances I've ever, ever seen. She had me laughing with every line reading and every tic and every stumble. I fully felt like her Dad in the movie.

The Father (looking like Bo Burnham suspiciously) and Elsie's conversation around the fire had me in floods of tears. I wanted to reach out and hug her so much and thinking about her purity and her honestly in that moment has me nearly in tears the day after thinking about it. And then at the end I was laughing and crying at the same time. It's an incredibly cathartic experience for anyone who went through a reasonably traditional schooling experience.

Bo Burnham directs this film like a film and not like a documentary, and yet it's intimate, it's not artless. The music is sublime. Underscoring what she doesn’t say. It’s us viewing her world in ways we know. The soundtrack punctuates perfectly and the pervading sense of anxiety and dread in every frame and in almost everything she doesn’t want to do. Anxiety is dealt with in a really earthen and subtle way, true but not triggering. The score underscores the paradoxes of both elation and dread and the film isn't without its dark scenes; when she’s apologising after not doing anything wrong it's so painful without being disgusting or twisted. We hope she isn't left with any scars. But what blossoms is the wonder of seeing someone who acts the way they want to because it doesn’t matter if she does well to others. But just to her. The film has the air of shortly looking back, not from the perspective of someone in the 8th Grade, but someone perhaps looking back at a time capsule and remembering which is why it's used as such a clever device int he film. It portrays the youth in a knowing but also a slightly heightened way, the kind of way memory works, like Bo Burnham looking back authentically.

I was interested as to where it would go and desired for no clichés, and in that it delivers largely, the film is focused on the moments between the drama, that are the real drama. And as a character study, it's so interesting to watch how things can compound and alter a person on a week by week basis. Or when you can't stand yourself, who you used to be, who you are now, and fear who you may end up being. That spongebob moment is a great silent offering of this feeling. And wonderfully and appropriately the film is utter cringe and reminds me of the time I didn’t know who I was with aplomb. It evolves to a person finding themselves. And who hasn't had to do that at some point? Eighth grade or otherwise. There's a moment during a later Vlog where in passing she mentions ""...I don't know if anyone cares..."" My Fiance just yelled ""We Care!"" And we do. And anyone who feels alone, should try and remember this."

Her dad in the movie (played by Josh Hamilton) also gives such an authentic performance and really comes off as a funny and lovable father who just wants the best for Kayla. The rest of the supporting cast is great, but it is Kayla and her dad's relationship specifically that grounds the film and provides the most emotional and gut punching moments in the entire movie.

Kayla is in her last year of the middle school, and she is known as been a very introvert person that doesn't have many friends, spend a lot of time on internet and not actually having real relationship, and than she decide that she wants things to be different and face some challenges trying to find some experiences, doing that she also put her vlogs on internet looking foward to give people some advices. Directed and written by Bo Burnham.
The great about this movie is that it teaches you, didactically in a very natural way, a lot about living the life, from the perpesctive of a teenager, wich for a lot of us, still have situations that are really close to what they go through. In this story we can get perfectly how it is to be like one of them, in the minimum details, the subtleties that the character of Kayla is nothing but perfect, wich is a lot of points for the director, Bo Burnham and the actress Elsie Fisher, the way that she tries to speak to others and fail, the way that she is always looking down to speak to almost everyone, the shy, she been somewhere with people talking, even know that she got invited to do it so, but she just don't feel comfortable on it, all of that is so relatable and real, simple and real like few things in Hollywood are.
The lessons from Kayla's videos are: 1st - Be yourself: Of course, we gotta be ourselves and accpet that all the time to be happy, the situation is that sometimes we even think that we are someone that we actually aren't, and that happens with Kayla there. Another lesson would be: Putting yourself out there: and also, of course, you gotta expose who you are, talk to people, and that is so important, because met new people are essential for life, and you never know who you gonna met, and that is perfectly showed in this film. Confident, is important for you to be confident to all of the things in life can go well, the movie is good in letting us know that is normal and good to be afraid, you just gotta go on.
The fact that you really care for the main character in here is essential, and you can see that she is learning a lot and risking a lot, doing different things that she isn't usual to, and you all the time is cheering for her, and the movie is also real in the sense that the things that happens, actually are true and somethings go well and some doesn't, that every action ends up in a consequence, and some of these consequences can be horrible, no one is perfect, the movie pretty good in showing us that, nothing is perfect and there a lot of scary things around there. Letting us know that the worshiped people aren't necessary the better people to be with, there are people that can be way more fun and aren't so hyped by others, always try the different.
In acting there are some really good content in here, Elsie Fisher with only fifteen years old is already giving some really good work out there, she is great in this movie, she could interpret the shy person perfectly, you can totally see in her the lack of confidence in some moments and the need to get friends and to make contact, but just being unable to do it so, the anguish is felt in her, she can also be very kind, and have different layers in voice and in other aspects, she is great. Josh Hamilton is also great, overall in the movie he did worked exactly how a father would, accepting the childern's moment, but always with a bigger tie of concern, and i totally believed in him, in his concern, and he also have a really good monologue at the very ending, really touching. Jake Ryan is really nice in this movie, he portrays the perfect match for Elsie's character, he is kind and fun.
The soundtrack is on point, it does have a hope moment when things are getting better for the character, and the lack of track in some moments i also found pretty well used, it helped to give the perfect situation for the moment.
The photography is also good, there are some plans that can really help us in understand the scene. The movie works with the technologies that are used by the people in that age really well, and the photography works quite well in this aspect, there are one or other moment where it may get to polluted. There are one or another moment where things get in slow motion and not really pretty in what they do, i found some of these goofy, but overall it worked.
Eighth grade is a fantastic movie, one of the most real movies from the year that can have wonderful teaches to people that are in that age range and also for everybody else, because knowing ourselves is a thing for life, we are always changing and always gotta be aware of what is going on, being respectful and understandable or apprehensible."

'Eighth Grade' is an honest and relatable look on growing up. Almost hard to watch at times, but dose an excellent job of making you feel for the protagonist. Embracing it's cringe that many people, including myself are familiar with.

Bo Burnham perfectly captures the teenage phase with awkward close-ups and the camera focused on Kayla which shows her isolation. Who would've predict a comedian now acclaimed director.

Elsie Fisher (the coolest girl in the world) is so incredible that I completely forgot she acting. Before she was unknown, but now consider herself known after this. Also Josh Hamilton is fantastic as Kayla's lovable dad. There is not a single performance I did not buy in this movie.

So much of media aimed towards younger viewers and audiences may come off with the delusions that they get us, but often they come off like a shirt at Walmart with #Relatable printed on the front. So when there was a ton of hollow pop songs trying to say ""This is you and therefore this is for everyone,"" here's this New Zealand girl, around my age range, who came right out of nowhere with a smash hit against the norms about being broke and living in a nowhere town but still they wanna party it up with the rich crowd because who wouldn't, I was like ""Yes! Finally! This is me!"" And then I listened to the album it came from, Pure Heroine, and I was hooked and **** in with songs like Tennis Courts and Team and White Teeth Teens and ESPECIALLY Ribs, I just felt like someone who is still young finally gets it! It might seem like a weird way to write this review, but let me just say that watch Eighth Grade just made me say ""Yes! Finally! Someone gets it!""

Roger Ebert once wrote about the adaptation of Ghost World (which you should go watch) and said that he wanted to hug that movie. This is exactly how I felt about Eighth Grade. I wanted to hug Kayla and tell her that it's going to be okay and that she is absolutely wonderful...only to realize that as a grown man that's creepy as **** VnV This effect of emotion and caring largely came from the main brains behind this wonderful film, Bo Burnham (an absolutely hilarious comedian and a very talented man at that) just nails that type of honest emotion. It relies a lot on cringe humor with teachers dabbing and the intense fear of socializing with the cool kids who do not like you, but it all works because not only is it funny, but you also can relate to it. There's no artifice with overly stereotypical characters, it feels like real people having real discussions and the real feeling of happiness and white knuckle feeling of ""Oh God I just embarrassed myself in front of everyone!"" Seriously with all the uses of ""likes"" and ""ums"" and the use of social media in a natural way, the script is absolutely amazing! It makes the highs all the more high, and the lows all the lower. Like it has been a while for a film to make me feel that sinking feeling in my stomach like the car scene. There's an immediate comparison to be made for the films John Hughes made in the 80s like the Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink, which is a totally legit comparison, but the movie it most reminded me of is last year's Lady Bird, where I never felt like I was watching actors but real people in this real scenarios saying totally real things!

The acting is also amazing too. Everyone in this movie is great. Literally no bad performance! Elise Fisher (mostly known for doing the voice of one of the girls in the first two Despicable Me films, so this is a real upgrade) carries this film! She is honestly terrific with this role and she makes you care for this girl, again it doesn't feel like an act but a real girl in middle school. Josh Hamilton is also great too being the awkward dad and him and Elise have terrific and believable chemistry. And that's the key word here, believable. I didn't feel like anyone was faking or over-dramatizing their roles! I didn't see actors, I saw people!

The only complaint is that while Bo is a great writer, as a director it does feel a little rough. The movie goes for a naturalist approach, not exactly being polished but filming in a way where it feels more like voyeuristic approach (voyeurism isn't the right term but go with me), where you feel like you are there with the characters and not done like it would be in a professional film with tripods and steady cams and whatnot. Which can certainly work for the realness of the film, but there were points where it can feel a bit stagnant and lacking in variety. But I feel that what we've got from Bo for his first outing is still great and there were some shots here that felt like he knows what to do in terms of the film language, so hopefully over time he will learn more from how to make a film.

Overall this is just a really good movie and I absolutely love it! Highly recommend it! I might bump it up to a 5 upon a second viewing, but either way no film this year has hit me in the same way this movie did!"

Allí Greta explora la historia de una joven en el último año de preparatoria y la tensa relación con su madre, allí la historia se maneja básicamente por las tensas conversaciones entre madre e hija; acá las actuaciones logran transmitir todo, solo vemos a Kayla en sus actividades cotidianas y nos identificamos con ella, compartiendo todas sus dudas y problemas.

Elsie Fisher hace un gran trabajo interpretando a Kayla. Entra las películas de este estilo con temáticas similares, esta destaca por no quedarse en el cliché y contar la historia políticamente correcta, sino que además explora otras temáticas poco convencionales, pero igual de cruciales.

Eighth Grade

Burnham's candid version of the current generations that chisels out art through commercialism, is the tap that not only they, but we all need. Holding no bars, this venture is definitely not for everyone. And not because of the gut-wrenching and bold decisions that it takes while exploring the characters, but the peeling of the nature in front of the audience which is cringeworthy to encounter. And it's that nakedness that Burnham isn't and shouldn't be shy about. Conveying the aspired message through a teenage psychology and no other perspective above it, it is a sweet home run on terms of getting that message written on banners that is loud and clear for all generations. The characters are three dimensional and genuinely real to a point, where you feel embarrassed on observing their day to day life since it feels like we are unnecessarily poking our nose in, on someone's life; YES, it is that real. It is often presumed, that too much accuracy and practical approach may extract out the cinematic experience, but if kept alive on screen in each frame with such ninja-like awareness, the euphoric energy never fades away. And this dose of exhilaration is in plethora and yet still it doesn't grow flat. The primary key to it, would be to foliate each emotion through its own tone, so that if there are ups and downs, it should sound reasonable and not mere compromise. Fisher is natural. She holds back emotions and expresses that with such buoyant nature, that it keeps giving you back what you expect it from, no matter what they say, she is ""cool"". The narration is neither elaborative nor adaptive, it is gripping and undoubtedly correct, now ""correct"" sort of script isn't something that is easily available, but we have a gold mine over here. And Burnham is well aware of it, he never takes his potential of the concept for granted, his execution is much more powerful than the script. His off screen presence can be felt by his sensational work with the help of an amazing cinematography. Not only the conversations written are pragmatic, but they are performed too with such accuracy that it can leave your head spinning. Overlapping of arguments, petty ideologies, different priorities among kids and the frame of reference that is bizarrely genius in here, are these tiny notions that amps up this 90 minute act. Burnham narrows down higher concepts to such simple terms, that you can feel the stakes with equal emotions that the character might be going through with, like when Fisher is about to open the door and join the pool party. This humane analysis of glorifying each tiny moments is what makes this non-crispy tale into a highly pitched cinematic experience. It is a much, much mature idea that Burnham has taken in hand, and his grip is firm and fair to the storytelling. Eighth Grade deserves much higher grade than it claims to be in, strike off the walls, this is not an indie film."

The main character of Kayla hit me personally on so many notes and probably many others, which makes the film all the more special. Director Bo Burnham obviously understood exactly what modern middle school is like in a better way than most who try and succeeds where other modern coming-of-age stories/timepieces, like Boyhood, fail."

722,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/eighth-grade/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,JLuis_001,"Sep 26, 2018",7,"Middle school or high school can be a place of enormous pleasure in the memories of people who spent a great time there and it can be a hell of memories for those who had a hard time there. Especially the outcasts and those who suffered bullying.

Countless films have dealt with the subject and each one, depending on its release time, dealt with the typical problems of each generation. However, the youth of this last decade is in a way more intricate because it's a generation that lives perpetually attached to their cellphone and everything they do, they need to register it for the online masses.

Eight Grade shows that essentially and that is all that sustains it. Eight Grade deals with an obviously lonely and incredibly innocent young girl who makes videos giving motivational advice which is surprising considering that she's barely able to make friends.
I will not say that she suffers from depression but I do think she suffers from anxiety. We're seeing a girl without friends who lives an incredibly routine, day by day at her school with nothing remarkable happening to her. She has a crush on the typical bad boy who plays sports and obviously she's not within the grace of the ''popular girls''

Eight Grade is not a great story and neither is a great movie but the way it's done,
the way in which its young protagonist takes the baton of the story and frankly the situations that surround her are genuine, or at least they feel genuine enough. That's what makes it stand out on many other films that deal with a similar subject.
And maybe the best thing about it is that it gives us a main character who tries to make things work, who tries to adapt and make friends. She's not a young girl immersed in misery feeling sorry for herself and that's refreshing and even more so that despite the situations to which she exposes herself, she never betrays herself in order to fit in.
Applause for its young protagonist; Elsie Fisher who is the true revelation of this film.

Eight Grade is not a film that comes to innovate but knows how to make use of its strengths to take forward a story that remains relevant and is definitely a very good option for its generation and genre.

And by the way I have to say it out loud. The music was **** annoying."

As someone who’s essentially lived in the setting of this movie, this is the perfect portrayal of it. This is one of greatest directorial debuts of all time, and I couldn’t be more impressed.

Out of every horror film that I've watched, every jumpscare I've flinched, and every bloodspill I've cringed, this is the film that I've looked away the most. There's almost a beauty in an aspiring director who has made, by just using the fear-inducing forces of reality to make us cringe, worry, and just wish to walk out the most. The feeling of being trapped in a harsh reality is so strong, and so crippling, that when Eighth Grade finally gives you some time to breathe, it feels heaven-sent. With an astonishing breakthrough from writer director Bo Burnham, and a flawless, realistic depiction of fear, anxiety, and doubt that nearly everyone is forced to endure at the specified time period, Eighth grade is surely one of, if not the best film of the year."

While funny in that trademark eccentric, Bo Burnham style, so many scenes are very uncomfortable and are quite scary in fact! The emotional tone set by the shots and performances in this film are incredibly strong. As for Elsie Fisher, this is a breakout performance and she truly carries the movie on her shoulders. The critique of youth and technology is very well made, with such uncomfortably funny scenes such as kids not taking a school shooting drill seriously, or the fact that they are all isolating themselves in the depths of the internet will hit close to home for a lot of viewers. As much as things change, they stay the same however, as sex and **** are recurring topics in this movie. Sex is portrayed as both awkward, disgusting, and in one beautifully constructed scene in the back of a car, terrifying and predatorial.

Bo Burnham has made an excellent first film. Elsie Fisher carries herself and this film with intense vulnerability and grace. I will not be surprised if I see Eighth Grade popping up in the awards season this year."
731,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/eighth-grade/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GrantD243,"Aug 3, 2018",9,"Eighth Grade is about a girl named Kayla who is at the end of her time in middle school and is getting ready to start high school. This isn't the story of some kid who has it all figured out or is extremely popular, though. In fact, this is the story that many people will find very relatable regardless of what generation you grew up in. If you had an awkward experience in eighth grade or if you weren't the most popular kid, you'll relate to this one. Sure, it'll probably speak more to current students or those that have gone through middle school during the 21st Century (as I have), but while technology has changed immensely over time kids only change so much. This film does touch the idea that technology has become a huge influence over the lives of kids these days quite a bit, and it portrays it in a very realistic way. I went through middle school before social media took over (Myspace and Facebook were just starting to gain traction), but cell phones were the hot ticket and many of the notes that this film hits on regarding social media were still very relatable to me. But the real story of this film is Kayla trying to become more confident in herself, trying to make more friends, and trying to work through how awkward the world seems to her at this time in her life. This film pulls no punches. It doesn't sugar coat anything and it doesn't make middle school seem better than it is like a lot of films and television shows do. It goes where you think it wouldn't dare go, and that makes it just that much better. There are some scenes in here that will make some people incredibly uncomfortable, but that's kind of the point. Eighth grade is an uncomfortable time, and it only makes sense for a film covering it to be uncomfortable at times. Elsie Fisher does a tremendous job as Kayla, and I have to assume that there's some of her in her portrayal as well because I believe she just finished eighth grade not that long ago, and Josh Hamilton (Kayla's dad) is solid as always. Yes, this film is R rated even though it is about a girl in the eighth grade. However, I wouldn't discourage parents from taking their kids to see this if they're of the appropriate age (around seventh grade or older). It's primarily rated R because of language, but there are some subjects that parents may flinch at when they're brought up in a film that their kid is watching. But, they're subjects that kids are going to encounter at school anyway, and maybe it'll even provide an opportunity for discussion after the showing ends. Everything about Eighth Grade is solid, but it's how the story will relate to people that really makes this a very worthwhile watch."
732,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/eighth-grade/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TrevorsView,"Aug 2, 2018",8,"Dear readers, surely you know that today’s youth carry a huge responsibility ahead of themselves that often goes against their personal commitment to please people, a struggle that stems from their pressures to fit in. It’s a difficult task to explore the crisis kids today face, yet first-time director Bo Burnham miraculously succeeded!

Although you first may wonder, “is this R-rated work teen-appropriate?” Well, for fair warning, most teenagers might be too young to maturely discuss the more adult content (language, blow jobs), although I still encourage anyone older than eighteen to watch Eighth Grade because it is filled with wisdom about what it’s really like to grow up in the millennial age.

Clever filmmaking tricks seldom strive to wow us, its most ambitious technique being its simple focus on the glowing screen of the protagonist, eighth-grader Kayla. After dad jump-scares her while she scrolls through Instagram, Kayla’s phone cracks quite heavily, and your view of her social media presence turns disturbed for the remainder of the run time. When not filtered through the internet, Kayla instead comes off as nothing short of awkward. No Hollywood plastering here: the intense facial focus amplifies Kayla’s countable zits on her face.

Her increased pressures compel Kayla to post a series of YouTube advice videos, one of which opens the feature much like the first scene of Annie Hall. She gives some great advice, including how the “school you” differentiates the “pool you” and the “movie you,” so you must reach out to let everyone know the full “real you,” a point she proves by going out to sing karaoke despite her nervousness. Then each video ends with her signature phrase, “Gucci!” Except does anybody watch her vlog? It doesn’t matter a whole lot anyway, because Kayla doesn’t make her videos because others need advice, but because she must hear herself think as she goes through these troubles herself.

Away from social media, Kayla follows a makeup tutorial in front of her motivational sticky note-bordered mirror, so that she can then post it on Instagram as a lame post-makeup-application “just woke up like this” post. Sadly though, it can’t compensate for her class voting her, “most quiet.” As her last week of middle school drags on, you look past her embodiment through significant mundaneness, particularly with how her earbud music overpowers her dad’s voice. True to that style, raucous sound plays before she enters dangerous territory of a birthday party seeing her swimsuit body.

To more brilliant results, the dialogue complements maturation through awkward conversations, such as Kayla’s hilarious discomfort of a blow job tutorial. Whether it’s the dabbing old principal, or how various social media platforms define middle schoolers from high schoolers, or the single most realistic first date on film ever, humor stays consistent. But then all humor stops suddenly altogether in a clear #MeToo moment that forces you to hold your breath out of fear. So, jokes aside, this complete ninety-three-minute outline of puberty development captures the entire transitional stage thanks to the perfect editing. You never lose track of time, even if the image lingers on Kayla’s disconnect from her father.

Although to be fair of what this movie does wrong, little is learned about one boy who has a crush on Kayla. Another guy Kayla adores also comes off too one-dimensional, along with the stereotypical class beauty queen Kayla idolizes. Though somehow, those three characters have stronger presence than God, who here is nothing but a big missed opportunity to express Kayla’s existential crisis, as evidenced by a meaningful but skimmed over scene when she prays out of tremendous conflicting fear.

Yet this generalization of certain teenage tropes works to its advantage as it makes you naturally want to avoid whatever traits you see. A fine example happens during a conversation Kayla has with the beauty queen’s mom; she focuses on the daughter instead of the mother, revealing Kayla’s ideal wants away from the generational gap. These tight facial closeups are the secret to showing the way kids at that age always believe eighth grade is the end of everything. Trust me, Kayla’s maturation process by the end strikes your feels hard, especially once you hear her father’s sincere monologue in front of a soft campfire glow.

I find it hilarious how earlier this year, Hollywood legend Steven Spielberg phoned in a celebration of reality through a motion picture meant to glamorize pop culture, yet here, a complete nobody creates a far superior work which truly does celebrate reality over technology. Therefore friends, I guarantee Kayla will help you remember eighth grade fondly from now on forward. Hang tight everyone, Gucci!"

Yes we've seen movies like this before; this film, unlike ""Boyhood"", won't be talked about as some kind of cinema revolution in decades to come (the two films really are so different they shouldn't be readily compared, though they have similar titles, came out at close to the same time, and deal with the experience of youth). But that's perfectly fine, because the craft is exceptional. The story is interesting the way it builds, the acting is great, particularly by Karidja Touré in the lead as she physically transforms once, and then again completely believably. And what's more, this has the most memorable use of an American pop song in a foreign film I have seen in a very long time. Just great."

It’s a French animated film that has sadly gone directly to DVD over here, but it is really worth a watch.  Based on a graphic novel of the same name, the best way of describing the film is ‘it’s a steam punk animated film’ that feels like a mix of Tintin and Studio Ghibli.  I really enjoyed watching it, it had lovely moments, great characters and a decent plot.  Plus the steam punk setting mixed with the really cool French animation lead to some really great imaginative moments, even of a couple of them felt like they were ripping of Howl’s Moving Castle.

As a film fanatic who grew up watching lots of 2D animations, I'm very happy to see they're still alive in other parts of the world after Hollywood abandoned them for 3D animations. Especially when it comes to this kind of animation, obviously the France produced some extraordinary films in the recent years such as 'Ernest & Celestine', 'A Cat in Paris', 'Zarafa' et cetera. This is an internationally produced film in the French language, but available in the English language too, which was based on the graphic novel by the French cartoonist Jacque ****.

This is the story of a young girl Avril that takes place in the 1940s, Paris. But it all begins many decades earlier that reveals how a family of three generations were pursued by the powerful men. It is the parallel universe story, especially when it comes to the technology, the world is underdeveloped and is in the steam age. This film is about the science and invention where Avril's parents, grandparents were on the verge to invent an ultimate serum. Now those bad guys are after Avril and her cat, Darwin. So before they catch her, she must find her family members if they had survived the crash a decade ago to put an end to all the surrounding mysteries.

Usually Europe means fairy tales with magic stuffs, but this is an sci-fi-adventure. Feels like watching a Japanese anime. Excellent story, the brilliantly developed characters with lots of suspense and thriller, so I don't think it makes sense to call it a comedy or children's film. Definitely for all ages, the film has a bit of everything to please the people from different generations. The sketches were another highlight, very catchy with the low bright colours. Directed by the two new directors, but their's experience is the fine result of this film.

""Cats don't dance. And they don't talk! So be quiet.""

It is a beautiful world with the twin Eiffel towers, a bridge in the English channel kind of stuffs, yet it suffers from all types of severe pollutions. The global warming is the hot topic right now, but this film sets in 65 years earlier. So it comes in the line of 'Boy and the World', but all the focus was turned towards the family of scientists and their adventures than to press harder on the important issue. But throughout the narration, it is quite clear the world was affected by without the proper scientific progression and adaptation to save it. Avril might be the centre of the story, but the film character distributed widely and theirs story were well preserved to keep the excitement and pace steady till the end. So be prepared for some unexpected, because it's very matured yet a light humorous film.

The title might give an expression of a cliché, so if you expect a fantasy tale, then you're in the wrong place. But I'm surprised for how unique it was from other sci-fi films. Especially somewhat resembles 'Les Misérables' and some others, yet quite refreshing with all the twist and turns. When the actual story ends, there's an extended scene which makes us to dream for a sequel to come. But it all ended here, so a follow-up is very unlikely. Apart from the story, the technical brilliance was like par with the Animes, especially it reminds Miyazaki's films. These directors must keep doing films like this and who knows they may become the French versions of Tomm Moore.

One of the best animations of the years. A sci-fi which is not a dystopian theme. I said that because that's what very common in the current films. Instead, it is a mid 20th century story and totally an entertaining film with the breathtaking visuals. The story wise, it is nothing less than any similar live-action themes. It should have been very popular by now, but it is not and the reason is it is not a Hollywood. That's really very sad, but if you are an international film fan then you should give it a try and animation fans must not skip it. Like I said you won't often get a film matured, at a time funny as this one where adults and children can sit together.

749,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hale-county-this-morning-this-evening/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,HollywoodGlee,"Nov 27, 2019",8,"Hale County, This Morning, This Evening written, directed and produced by RaMell Ross, and Winner of a Special Jury Prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival. Ross tells the story of two African-American males, Daniel and Quincy, born in Hale County, Alabama, and the diverse paths their lives take.  Hale County, This Morning, This Evening breaks the mold of a traditional documentary with its cinematic language and use of montage.

In the film's opening sequence, an immediate distrust of the camera is highlighted in a bold directorial choice regarding one of the film's subjects, Quincy, who works at a catfish plant to support his young family. ""What is the orbit of your dreams?' sneaks into the lower left-hand corner of the film in a title, textual overlay. A transition is made revealing a small-town street lined with black folks sitting on their cars. Nice, non-diegetic music accompanies the camera as it glides down the street. Them folks are impervious to what is going on 'round them. Welcome to the Deep South where race is constructed and dreaming is an everyday part of existence. RaMell Ross is a philosopher, a photographer, a teacher a high-school basketball coach and now a filmmaker.

Ross utilizes his photography skills to great effect capturing simple, elegant moments that juxtapose other images like a grown man heaping a large truck tire onto a fire while off-screen voices provide commentary on the color and density of the smoke rising into the air. This telling scene was proceeded to by the title textual overlay, ""What is done when all the cotton is picked?' Ross is not sugar-coating the environment. This type of call and response brilliantly forms the crux of the film's narrative. In another scene a young girl who hasn't learned to speak is being questioned by a semi-literate grown woman. First, she asked the young girl her name (though I couldn't comprehend the pronunciation of the word name). When the girl didn't reply she asked a few more time with each rendering becoming more intelligible only to be followed up with a ""How old you are?""

As a basketball coach, Ross has access to the film's second primary character, Daniel, a strong, physically fit basketball player longing to escape the confines of his environment. Part of the beauty of Ross's cinematography and consequent cinematic language is the tight framing of Daniel as he practices his jump shot. While Daniel might be confined for now, this (basketball) is his way out, his way to freedom from confinement.

In my opinion, the film ended rather abruptly evoking a feeling of wanting something more and left me pondering what I had just experienced. The montage of imagery alone makes this film worth seeing. But Ross adds a deep, visceral element, coupled with philosophical interjections, that creates a work of art transcending the confines of the theatre. It begs to be experienced. The result is a highly compelling, experimental film seemingly influenced by Melvin Van Peebles' spawn of the Blaxploitation era, Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. And, with a run time of a fast seventy-six minutes, it's one you don't want to miss! Highly recommended."

I think more than anything else what makes it a bit heavy is that its pacing is slow and there's too much exposition.
It's understandable because the story needs to settle everything down, but that prevents it from getting a more dynamic pace, nevertheless the story is so good as its characters that immersing yourself in both is an inescapable act.

There's no doubt that Mudbound doesn't break any new ground in terms of the themes embedded in its plot, but the most basic rule of any storytelling comes to the fore: You can tell the same story as many others before you. What sets you apart is how you do it, and Mudbound succeeds in that regard."

Touching on the intersection of religion, morality, alternative slavery in the jim crow era, American identity, and family relations. It really hits on nearly every point of significance, and it makes you feel. It has one of the saddest moments I've experienced in a film, and yet also shows the resilience of the human spirit, and the humanity of people who endured the struggles of the era, and has moments of body-chilling inspiration and hopefulness.

Mudbound lays bare an ugly truth about the south during world war 2, and makes us question to what extent it is still going on. 80 years after the abolition of slavery and there was naked, disgusting terrorists bullying blacks. What is going on now, 80 years after the end of ww2? While the movie does an expose on all the above and more, it is not the message of the film. The final message of hope, love, and overcoming. A rose can grow from concrete."

It made a very good job in making me care about the characters. Every character feels compelling and realistic and has an understandable motivation. The visual style gives this movie its own personality. I loved how it's animated and the look of everything from the characters to the sets. Don't be fooled by its colorful and lighthearted appearance, because this is not a kids movie. I can't say it's an adult film, because it isn't either, but it's refreshing, at least in film animation, to see a movie starring a bunch of kids to be more adult-oriented and mature. There isn't a single moment that feels dull or unnecessary. The pacing is great because it always moves forward to tell us something new about the characters. The innocence of the kids is well captured here. I cared about these children and that was a shocker for me because kids in movies have the reputation to be annoying, but here, they are well developed and everyone has a distinct personality. I was genuinely shocked to learn about everything that they went through and I really wanted to see them accomplish what they want.

This is a fantastic movie anyone should watch. My only issue with it is that it's way too short,  but I think it doesn't really bother me because the story it tells in that short runtime, it's genuinely interesting, thought-provoking and heartwarming.

Whenever I review a Stop-motion animated film, I always start with by saying it is a dying art form that needs a bigger lift from us. It gave a new life for filmmaking when there were no technology like computers hundred years ago for the creation of giant creatures to all the fantasy and magical world. I am glad that every year someone coming forward to show the world how beautiful these are.

I think there's a quota for it and 2D animation for the Oscars. Otherwise, these formats would die sooner than we expected, so that recognition in the big stage. Every year at least one film from these two categories makes out. This year it was a double jackpot for Stop-motion animation. Including this, 'Kubo and the Two Strings' was the other one to shine in the world's biggest film awards ceremony. But winning the trophy is almost impossible in this 3D animated film world. Anyway, I'm happy for this, that I enjoyed watching it.

It was a short film, that ran for just one hour. First, we have to understand filmmaking in this form is a most challenging one than any other. It is a manual work. I mean people get in there and frame by frame do all the work. So for this one hour film, they had done the great hard work and it paid off well by got nominated for the Oscars. It was also Switzerland's official submission for the Best Foreign Language Film, but failed to make progress in that race.

The screenplay was based on the book. A simple story with a strong message. This is the tale of a boy with full of dreams and after his alcoholic mother died, he is taken to the orphanage. That is the last place he wanted to be where he meets a mean boy and soon becomes his close friend. Being young kids, they tend to play some pranks with officials, visitors and themselves. That's one of the ways to cope with for where they have ended. So the remaining is to tell us would they get a second chance in their lives.

❝I don't know why I'm crying. Sometimes people cry because they're happy.❞

When some take up a project like this, they are not offered to make mistakes in choosing a weak screenplay. Because there are thousands of films in production around the world and in those, a handful of animated films, but probably he's only one up for a Stop-motion animated feature. Which means everyone with the knowledge of his commitment will be looking forward to it. So the filmmakers have opted to adapt a novel, which is always a best option in filmmaking.

The next is the characters. Making them come alive, particularly initial stage, the creation of models. Yep, they have done that job as well so well. Gooding looking ones, especially among the kids for having similarity with their vision. The frame rate was good. Very smoother for viewing. So technically it was a flawless for the normal watch. An impressive storyline, which might serve as a tearjerker for a few.

There's a little romance, but from the children's perspective of having a crush. Since the girl character was introduced, the narration takes a fresh look. The following event becomes even more adventurous and fun filled till the end. The voice-over was excellent. From the dialogues to the film scenes very impressive. It marks the directional debut for a short filmmaker. An appreciable work and I hope he makes more like them with new technics than migrating to computer animations.

One of the advantages is it is a short and sweet film, but those who love such films might feel it is too short. Most importantly, there're not clichés like what we've seen films that takes place in the orphanages. The opening was shocking. If it was a real life, the boy would have ended in a different place. Still the emotional parts were less explored, yet very convincing for not leaning too much on that facet.

The film is one of the best in its kind, but I agree it's not a masterpiece. Not if you have seen plenty of Stop-motion animations in your life. Yet it can't be neglected that easily and surely it is for everyone. I know there are folks who thinks this format of films are for little ones, but the truth is they are still in the pre 90s mindset. This is good, give it a try and you might love it. Anyway, for its rareness itself highly recommended, then you decided how do you liked it or not.

The two phenomenon have been a subject to a similar bipolar division of reactions in the public where some glorified them, and others criticized them up to a point of hatred. This fact alone, proves that they have already accomplished their goal, they have had an impact on the world regarding subjects which societies, leaders, and people in general tend to persistently ignore.

I hope that we are entering a new era, where we leave behind the glorification of petty subject for plain fun and diminishing current events. Our societies by now have placed the highest values on athletes, famous actors, modern aristocracy... I hope the time has come for ordinary people, ""anonymous"" like Greta Thunberg and ""Honeyland"" with the authors and the main protagonist - Hatidze will be the new driving force in societies where with their influence they will cause radical societal changes and become the new heroes of a new era.

Hatizde, the last beekeeper of wild bees in Europe, admires everyone with universal values which we recognize in every culture, religion, philosophical and spiritual doctrine in the world, that most likely have been passed down and perfected from one generation to another. Respect for nature, humility, moderation, and compassion are silently reflected in the background through the entire course of the movie. Hatidze enjoys the companion of the bees, simply loving them, selflessly sharing the honey with them, half for people, half for them, - an extraordinary example of sustainability.

The fact that for the first time in the history of the Oscars a documentary is entering the competition in the category of best international movie, where all of the other nominees are based on fiction, is not surprising. Thanks to the authors for the mastery of making a documentary into art, that you literary take in as a feature film.

It's also interesting to notice that an unusual moment in the movie is experienced diametrically opposite. Hatidze's call for the bees, Maat, mat, mat, mat which some viewers interpreted as quote: ""When I heard her mumbling something, I turned it off..."" While others like the Dutch movie critic Belinda van de Graf experienced that moment as, quote ""Hatidze is singing to the bees...""

I personally experienced that moment as utterly poetic, a feeling I would like to explain further. The very call from Hatidze to the bees Maaaat, mat, mat, mat has its roots in the word matica - queen bee (lat. mater, matrix). It's particularly interesting that Hatidze is usually speaking ottoman Turkish language, but the word matica is also a Macedonian term, indicating an archaic word that surpasses today's languages. It's inevitable to ask a simple question. What magic is engaged in the queen, a simple insect, recognizing those words as a friendly call from a human, where according to Darwin's Theory of evolution these two species are so profoundly different?

Namely, when I first saw the trailer with awe last spring, the moment when Hatidze called the bees with the call Maaaat, mat, mat, mat is a moment that became so familiar and close to me. I suddenly remembered my childhood where in a mountain village in eastern Macedonia, a grandmother explained how they used to keep bees in woven baskets, identical like the ones Hatidze uses. In short, among other things was the recognition of the call to the queen Maaaat, mat, mat, mat quietly gathering the bees around and communicating with them. In that moment the pieces of the puzzle came together and I realized that when Hatidze is singing the ""mantra"", she is identifying herself with the queen bee, taking on her role, calling, gathering, communicating just like the queen would, Hatidze becomes the queen bee. An incredible symbiosis between human and nature.

With this story I want to express my admiration of the movie, to the authors as well as to the audience. They have acknowledged the fact that there is no successful or unsuccessful life, no important or unimportant human, no significant or insignificant story, all lives are successful, unrepeatable experiences. This movie casted a light on a seemingly simple life, and uplifted and glorified a supposedly ordinary human, which turned out to be deeply ethical, pure, loving, towards people and nature alike, and simply beautiful, just like the movie itself."

The direction is to be applauded also for its minute attention to details of the farm life (though it feels a bit too fetishistic at times with long takes of skinning the animals...). But the film feels imbalance in its treatment of the two characters. The handsome Romanian is there to service the British rural farm boy and to bring him out of his repressed stoic way.  What's in it for Gheorghe especially when Johnny was nothing but a brutal charmless bloke?  A chance to be away from his poor country? Would he be doing this mainly for economic reasons? This would have been more acceptable if the movie weren't so hung up on its being a ""love story"" b/c I don't see what's to love about Johnny from Georghe's perspective.  Johnny is more like a project than a love interest for someone who's as well-rounded as Georghe.  Writer/director Francis Lee can't have it both ways, portraying a gritty and sentimental romance."

806,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/gods-own-country/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Dec 1, 2017",8,"“God’s Own Country” is being compared to “Brokeback Mountain” but is a much better picture, especially regarding the two men in the center of the love story.

Johnny (Josh O’Connor) is a twenty something man who is running the farm his father Martin (Ian Hart), who has had a stroke, owns. The latter is a bitter man who seemingly has nothing but disdain for his son. Johnny’s grandmother Deirdre (Gemma Jones) is a cold woman who shows every bit of her hard life in her face.

Johnny feels overwhelmed with all the work he has to do and gets drunk every night occasionally having indiscriminate, unfeeling sex with other young men. His father, against Johnny’s wishes, hires a temporary worker to help on the farm during the lambing season and, at first resents Gheorghe (Alec Secareanu). Gheorghe is a Romanian immigrant who lost everything and resents Johnny calling him a gypsy.

We watch Johnny and Gheorghe slowly fall in love as they do the hard work required on the farm, starting at first more of a fight, it generally is an exploration of their bodies and an awakening of the emotions they eventually come to feel each other. There is a beautiful scene of the two men enjoying their life and domesticity when a major event takes place and that event also brings about major changes in their relationship especially Johnny’s decision to do something that puts their love at risk.

There are many tender scenes between the two men and a surprising one between the father and son later in the film. There are graphic scenes of farm life including the birthing of lambs, including the mouth to mouth resuscitation of one, the death of calves plus the real hard labor of a farmer from building walls of many varied size rocks to putting up fences among many other jobs.

The performances by Josh O’Connor and Alec Secareanu, making the romance look real and the sex scenes exciting,  are rock solid with the latter having the ‘smoldering sexy’ look that made a star of a young man in the old days of Hollywood. Both Ian Hart and Gemma Jones offering top support with the former being both stern and caring and the latter as not a particular warm women but accepting the farm life and her grandson when she figures out what is going on.

The director and screenwriter Francis Lee shows both the beauty and ugliness of the Yorkshire area in England and also of love. Lee in his feature debut is in complete control and Joshua James Richards with his photography helps the director show his love for the land.

A few asides:

1) Remember I am a city boy—the dealing with animals which may be natural to country people was a ‘hide the eyes’ moments for me!

2) While the sex scenes are graphic they are no more than shown in non-gay films.

3) Though I very seldom if ever tell when this is possible you can see the full film on youtube.

4) Though the speak English, it is England English, plus a heavy Yorkshire accent, I wish there had been sub-titles which mean when I do watch it on youtube I will use the caption option."

It is a perspective that is not often approached in cinema, perhaps because it is usually tackled through a male/female relationship, but because GOC takes on the theme from a male/male relationship, we are able to glimpse into this world without having to regard too heavily our PC culture. A great performance by the lead actor plus a simple, straightforward story and expert use of silence makes God's Own Country a movie for every indie theatergoer to see."

And although for me both things are very important in evaluating the film as a whole, I am able to recognize that even though it will be a film that will not get a perfect rating from me, the intention of its director is perfectly understood.

You have to pay attention and appreciate the details, especially the technical craftsmanship. It's a film that rewards but only a certain type of viewer."
809,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/kaili-blues/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,darknessinlight,"Jul 18, 2016",8,"“Kaili Blues”, a rebut film directed by Gan Bi who hadn’t been heard before by most film critics or audience. The Chinese name of this film “Lu bian ye can” originated from Strugatsky Brothers’ “Roadside Picnic” which was rearranged into “Stalker” by Andrei Tarkovsky. In “Kaili Blues”, elements of poem, time and long-take can all find their origins in Tarkovsky’s work. However, Gan Bi doesn’t stop at just making a film that pays homage to that Russian master. He granted this film his own style, own film language and own details.
Gan Bi chooses Gui Zhou---a South Eastern province covered by endless hills and mystic forests as the place of story in this film. This place is isolated, impoverished and distant at now. It was the same in the past and would be continued to remain in this situation. This is a place where no story could be told at all but at the same time, everyone has one’s story to tell. Its mystery along with unpredictable beauty were shown in every way under Gan Bi’s shots.
The first way is through the people living there for all their lives. Chen Shen, a doctor in Kaili clinic who has an inglorious past with local gang leader Monk but suddenly ended after he was caught into prison because of a fight. Through several fragmented scenes, people around him came into the story: Old Doctor in the clinic, Chen Shen’s brother Crazy Face, Crazy Face’s little son Weiwei as well as other native residents in Kaili. These fictive characters consist a picture of mystic region in China where everything can happen but always slips quickly without noticing by any one. Monk’s son was buried alive and chopped off one hands by Monk’s enemies; Crazy Face even intends to sell his son for money to gamble and drink but stopped by Monk. The film narrates these unusual events in a casual tone, reflecting reality which seems so ironical for audience to believe.
The second way is through the story. Gan Bi creates a story with his own experience in Gui Zhou, in Kaili (It’s a real town). Films come from reality but detached as far as it can from that. Chen Shen’s journey from Kaili to Zhen Yuan occupies most part of the story---from reality to illusion, from imagination back to life. His film language shows this story in the most dazzling way like what Tarkovsky did in “Stalker” while the story, in return, rises beyond the language and becomes a mystery itself. The climax of this story occurs in Dang Mai where time goes forward and back freely as Chen Shen tried to get to Zhen Yuan: There was a young man riding motorcycle who named also Weiwei and talked about “wild men” as Crazy Face’s son did before; a beautiful woman who owns a local hair salon looked just like his old lover; several Miaos appearing many times in his dream played reed-pipe wind instruments there. Zhen Yuan, Kaili and Dang Mai, these three places represent past, present and future in this story, forming a magical trinity in this isolated paradise.
The last way is symbols Gan Bi uses throughout his film. The clock, serving as one of the most frequently occurred symbol, created the background of time. From the beginning, the child Weiwei draw a clock on the wall and then he was taken by a mystic man who had numerous clocks in his house. Even on the journey to Zhen Yuan, Chen Shen saw more than few times clock around him, symbolizing time moving swiftly while no pattern could be traced. Train, another important symbol in this story, appears as an impetus, carrying Chen moving from places to places, past to future, future to present. Dang Mai, a mystic town, arouses audience’s curiosity but reveals unforgettable truth among this South Eastern Chinese landscape. The last forty-minute long take filming this “mystical paradise” is discussed enthusiastically by most of audience as well as film critics. Nevertheless, this is just a technique which itself of no great significance but carries the soul of this film to an apex.
There are so many Andrei Tarkovsky’s shadows revealing in “Kaili Blues” but they are not touching the soul. This is Gan Bi’s movie. His own movie showing a mystical but tragic story in distant South Eastern China. With Poem, with time, “Everything that can’t be turned, can be turned.”"

Everybody Wants Some!!

4 Out Of 5

Everybody Wants Some!! is a character driven hilarious drama about a new add-on to the group of guys who blends in before the college even starts. First and foremost, it's a Linklater movie; it's sassy, it's 80's, it's a revelation. His nature of seeking out its selective audience may have grown habitual to them but everytime he pulls out the rabbit from the hat, it leaves them in an awe of it with such mature ideology that it makes you think twice. The writing is smart, gripping, adaptive, elaborative and just plain fun throughout the course of it. Linklater's world may feel sketchy visually but its three dimensional characters (despite each of them are identified with a specific property, it somehow managed to achieve it) keeps it grounded. The music is seductive and the songs are up beating that elevates the momentum at its best; the boys singing on the car and the disco themed dance, it hits the perfect anticipated note. The costumes and the hair-styles and the accent and the references in each conversation; every little aspect of it demands attention; it is a delight to encounter such a breezy feature. The performance objective is the only weakness in here and don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it just isn't palpable to its strong writing. Linklater; the writer-director, has never been so robust and raw where the structure of the script may be transparent, but what a sight it is; pure elegance. The mannerism of the bonding, a conversation from the scratch and layered thought provoking policy are the high points of the feature that helps it enter the major league. Everybody Wants Some!! is something that not everybody gets but if taken seriously and read between the lines, you might find your mind blown away in its poetic tone."
813,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/everybody-wants-some!!/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,potatoman222,"Jul 21, 2017",8,"Sexo, drogas e... Discoteca?  Richard Linklater sempre foi o tipo de diretor que não se prende a uma trama, quem acompanha seus  trabalhos a mais tempo sabe do que estou falando. É notável o seu prazer por explorar situações e ambientar seus personagens, vimos isso na trilogia ""Before"" e até mesmo em seu último longa, ""Boyhood."" E aqui não é diferente. Jake é um calouro na faculdade e é recebido por seus colegas de fraternidade  em uma casa apenas para jogadores de beisebol. Em seus primeiros dias nesse novo mundo, Jake e seus amigos frequentam os mais diversos tipos de festas e fazem coisas imagináveis
Falar sobre adolescentes em fraternidades é um assunto datado, o mesmo já fora diversas vezes abordado antes, entretanto, um dos maiores acertos do filmes é saber lidar com esse assunto de uma forma nova, existe os clichês de sempre e os personagens caricatos, porém, Linklater soube retratar o tema de uma forma até sarcástica ironizando todos os trabalhos do gênero que antecedem o filme.  Não há uma trama aqui. O longa é quase como um grande experimento comportamental com jovens adultos e como é essa transição da adolescência e imaturidade para o começo da vida, propriamente dita. O filme é sobre experiências novas e acima de tudo sobre como curtir festas e se embriagar. Colocando assim, o filme parece bobo e vazio, mas acredite, ele é mais que isso.

Por mais que sua premissa seja simples, Linklater mostrou mais uma vez que sabe escrever. Os diálogos, hora hilários, hora bobos, dão um toque especial para o filme e sem dúvidas, o maior êxito são os personagens, todos muito bem escritos e interpretados. Cada um deles tem o momento para brilhar. Tyler Hoechlin interpreta McReynolds, um veterano com espirito de liderança que mostra durante o longa que não sabe perder. Suas aparições são poucas se comparadas a alguns outros personagens, porém toda vez que entra em cena, o mesmo rouba a atenção. Glenn Powell como Finn está perfeito, o ator deu vida com mestria ao personagem mulherengo e piadista que funciona muito bem como um escape cômico, mesmo que o filme por si só já seja um.  Com poucas meninas relevantes no elenco, Zoey Deuch interpreta Beverly, uma personagem que no inicio parece apenas ser um par romântico para o protagonista, mas com o desenrolar da trama se  mostra muito mais interessante que isso, até mesmo mais interessante que ele, diga-se de passagem.  O filme se passa em 1980, uma década em tanto para se retratar no cinema. Ainda com fortes influências nos anos 70, o filme nos da uma real sensação de que estamos mesmo naquele ano. A retratação e ambientação são quase tão boas quanto o figurino, que nesse longa é excelente! As referências musicais, aparelhos domésticos e até mesmo a forma despretensiosa como os jovens se comportam contribui para um aprofundamento maior da retratação de época vista aqui.   A direção de Linklater também é notável. O diretor prova sua experiencia com seus ângulos e movimentos de câmera que adicionam ao filme e ajudam a contar a história que o roteiro nos quer passar. Por mais que diferente de seus últimos filmes, o diretor soube bem captar a energia eletrizante desses jovens com dosagem certeira de humor."

Though that should be no surprise considering it's Richard freaking Linklater. And my God is it funny. ""Did he just flick a lime in my drink?!""

I noticed a similarity with the structure of La La Land here. This film starts as basically an 80's style college sex romp and transforms into the beginnings of a college set bildungsroman, with a sexless intellectually driven romance at its center. It's about finding your place in a place where everyone is doing that exact same thing (what happens when the best baseball player from every high school in the state goes to the same college?) The evolution of expectations into a more cogent and adult understanding of your place in the world and the beauty inherent in that.

This is a cheekier film than Dazed and Confused but in the same way that film was about nostalgia and the best years of your life before it could be understood, this is about the slow dawning of that realization. For some (Wyatt Russell's Willoughby or McConaughey's Wooderson) they realize this all too well and refuse to let go. Linklater finds the humanity in every single person. This is a movie about baseball jocks that couldn't be less about ""jocks"" in that unsubtle sense."

This is like a lighter and smarter version of 'Animal House'. The story takes place in the mid 1980 and three days prior to the first day of the college. This film follows a freshman named Jake, who is a baseball pitcher, with his first encounter with his new teammates, as well as housemates. And then a beautiful girl who he befriends. So it's all about the girls, party, video games, dare games and what else, these young guys make their footprint before the college opens. A very satisfying film, all the comedies are within the limits. I mean, usually American teen/student comedies are overwhelmed by adult jokes and mostly unrealistic. But this one seems real, yet cinematically very appealing to stick with it still the final scene.

All the actors were so good. Looks like it is the first film for most of them or I'm watching theirs. Many of them are going to be a big star in the future. Another excellent film by Richard Linklater and an awesome screenplay as well by him. According to him, it is a spiritual sequel to both his previous films 'Dazed and Confused' and 'Boyhood'. I've seen one, I'm going to check it out the other one very soon. Because I'm kind of started to like this filmmaker and his signature.

I was very impressed by the way the scenes and characters developed. Like everything was simple and familiar, yet very fun to watch. You know, between the seniors and freshmen, it's not like the film promotes bullying, but an understandable compromise which brings smile among us. The 80s setting was so good, almost flawless. The opening scene freaked me out, and then the rest of the film was completely different. Without the big stars, this film was a box office disaster, but surely it will find its place in the coming years. So I suggest you to check it out this rare comedy.

Though a bit far-fetched in its portrayal of college (how does the whole school have 8AM's on the first day) and a bit too movie-esque in that regard, the film is still a crowd pleaser. With terrific writing as always and a stellar cast led by Glen Powell, Blake Jenner, J. Quinton Johnson, and Zoey Deutch, the film is charisma, friendly ribbing, and college confidence in one truly enjoyable bundle. The comedy hits from beginning to end, the romance element actually works, the stupid antics are fun to watch, and the character development for such a large cast is tremendous. Similarly to Dazed and Confused, it is almost a travesty this is a film, due to the truly enjoyable and lovable cast. Not many can make this film feel restrained and not flat out dumb, but Linklater keeps the boys in check and ropes them in when they threaten to get off the rails thanks to his terrific direction and writing. As always, I want to live in a Richard Linklater film."

You didn't watch the complete piece of work which steadily grew on me as we took the journey with these ""jocks"". But it isn't just a movie about jocks; it is more about the point in time of these young people's lives. The college days, or more precisely an introduction to the college days in the 80's. The movie, as with any linklater film, takes multiple viewings to find all of the philosophy he has intertwined into this basic story. The movie does have a somewhat clunky start (the actors don't seem as grounded) but by the time the third scene rolls around I was completely invested. It kept me invested until the very end, and even if it hadn't I believe the ending would've brought me back for a second viewing, because it is where the message of the film is found.

It does for 80s college what Linklater's Dazed and Confused did for 70s high school, although this film admittedly does rely a little bit much on the formula that made Dazed and Confused so great as well. Nevertheless, it's also what gives the film its wit and charm! It also helps that it had a killer soundtrack to go with it!

He befriends, is taunted by, and otherwise parties and medicates alongside his new teammates in this ""spiritual sequel"" to Dazed and Confused, set in 1980 and named after a hit Van Halen single from the same year.  For around 25 minutes, I feared this would be a rare dud for writer and director Richard Linklater, a titan of American independent cinema whose best films include Before Sunset and Boyhood.  It is not very enticing at first, the prospect of spending nearly two hours with these oversexed, incredibly uncouth, and almost too perfectly sculpted bastions of testosterone, particularly compared to to the more diverse band of outsiders and squares found in Dazed and Confused.  But the film slowly won me over, subtly deepening certain characters and gesturing toward the transience of their fast and boozy lifestyle without sermonizing.  And the comic set pieces sharpen in the second half, including a memorably outlandish visit by the ball-playing bros to a Wonderland-and-Oz-themed party held by performing-arts majors."

Impossible to watch without a fond, admiring smile on your face and a new appreciation for the weighty, sensitive topics that the program frequently covered.

In his own open, methodically honest way, Rogers tackled everything from war to racism, illness to assassination, stripping the fear and uncertainty from difficult times while never skirting the issue or talking down to his young audience. It wasn't all so weighty, of course, but I was constantly taken aback by how efficiently and earnestly a puppet show could get through such material without feeling heavy-handed or agenda-driven. Rogers has a way of disarming potential explosives with a calm gesture and the force of his own warm personality. Soaking his feet on the porch with a black man on a hot summer day when race relations were particularly tense, for example. The simple message speaks as loudly to the adults as it does to their kids.

Seeing how easily Mr. Rogers was able to connect with each and every child on a personal level, I often felt inadequate as a parent, but I also found a model to strive for. Even in my late thirties, he's teaching me new lessons. Spiritually moving material that's guaranteed to dig up forgotten memories, inspire deep thoughts and invoke misty eyes."

That this kindly unassuming man succeeded in the insane world of television - is testimony to his unique ability to communicate everything about life’s most important issues... and he did this with few well-chosen words. Fred learnt about our most important basic human needs by coming to a thorough understanding of his own (then invested years leaning to understand it)

It’s rare that a filmmaker can so utilize the medium to convey a total understanding of his subject. Then of course, when the subject is as uniquely special as Mr Rogers --with excellent footage to access-- I guess you’re halfway home. Anyone who fails to recognise that what drives this special fellow is his genuine love of humanity, and his genuine desire to help everyone find the better person who lives within us all. With a few more like Mr Rogers, we could make many more healthy neighbourhoods.

Fred knew that to build a healthy mind, you have to begin with helping children wade through the swamp of the world’s confusing messages - so they can make genuinely informed decisions through the mist of their own worldview.  He also knew that the very medium he chose to work within was part of the problem. The force driving the largest part of television was not considering what was good for the child - but simply how it can position itself into the child’s thought patterns - creating addictive viewing habits and future consumers. Producers also knew that to push Fred for more in-the-can- Showtime was to be left with a sub-par end result. It was not about what the network wanted but what was good for the child. If Fred was being pushed for more commercial placement, then it would have been time for a new sponsor – end of argument.  This film well and truly earns its position as the highest-grossing Biographical documentary of all time.   There are sad scenes of ill-informed groups that push Politically Correct ideologies, denouncing Roger’s philosophy, and wrongly reducing it to being one of ‘Privilege’ - missing entirely, the true intentions of his work. Those being; the realisation that we are all ‘equally’ precious regardless of race, physicality, or wealth, therefore - with the ability to change for the better, our lives, and the world. Instead, we now see a divided world of ‘Identity Politics’ ruled by a violently selfish, ‘It’s About Me’ mentality - further reducing the essence of life to one of hatred and self-centred ignorance – there are none so blind...

They have thrown the baby out with the bathwater, allowing themselves to be blinded to the positive benefits of true Christian, Christ-likeness. Sure, there have been some that have faked (abused) their claims of Christianity but ‘true’ Christian ideals were what Fred Rogers was demonstrating.  So what is it they don’t like, the love or the forgiveness? Mr Rogers, we miss your genuine inclusive concern, and desperately need more like you!"

No other person on this planet understands children better than Mr. Rogers. Even just watching old clips from his show, it feels like he's talking to you and informing how unique you truly are, since no one else will say it.

Here's an excerpt: Fred Rogers was a radically unique individual. His compassion and caring for children was unmatched in the television space. It would have been easy to make a documentary to build him up to be a saint. This Christ like figure without any flaws, who only wanted to do good. (One of his children actually compares him to Christ on earth at one point). The movie engages a level deeper though. There are these beautifully intimate moments where we hear stream-of-consciousness writing when Rogers doubts his ability to pen a script. We see his initial refusal to accept his black gay co-star's sexuality. We hear Rogers' disbelief and doubt that he can have any impact after 9/11 to bring people together. Most of all we feel the discontent as an undercurrent throughout Rogers entire life. The film brings us to accept that that discontent and fear is just as much a part of the man as the happy high energy neighbor we know and love."

Thing is that show is still powerful today, but of course it got overshadowed by other educational shows airing at the time when the show ended. Thankfully, it's not forgotten and it doesn't have to be because now this documentary is the best documentary I have ever watched in my entire life.

Yet that was Mr. Rogers. This documentary was genuinely a pleasant hour-and-a-half to sit through.

Veteran documentary director George Manville expertly blends footage and interviews with Rogers' cast, crew, friends, and family in order to genuinely tug on the audience's heartstrings. I was in a small theater with a limited amount of people but there was so much reactions from the crowd during and after the film that it felt like you were in the audience for a popular blockbuster.

What is so compelling about Rogers that he wasn't someone with any big secrets or who was a very different person in his private life. He was as he appeared to be. His show wasn't just a gig. He created, wrote, directed, produced, etc. the show because he believed in helping children. Throughout we learn how he affected others and his drive and motivations but also his insecurities. Plus, they even talk about his short-lived show for adults, which I didn't even know about.

This really worked for me, but there are a couple points that may not gel for all people. Unfortunately, Rogers' show's second-longest running cast member Betty Aberlin (Lady Aberlin) declined to be interviewed, so we're missing her insight. (Not to say she should have, It's her priority.) The film focuses more on Rogers' career than his personal life, though bits and pieces are mentioned throughout, so don't expect a comprehensive biography."

I knew though he was an extraordinary man, full of love for children and frankly mankind and was determined to get the message across to as many kids as possible that they were loved, unique, and capable of anything they wanted to achieve.              But it went deeper than that.        As ""Won't You Be My Neighbor"" superbly shows us, he didn't ignore the ugly things in life with his beloved audience - he discussed horrifying events like war, the RFK assassination and other societal ills in a manner that kids would understand, knowing as many of us fail to recall or acknowledge ourselves that kids are a lot smarter and more aware of the world around them than we think.       I know as a kid myself I was interested in the news.       I knew people, including schoolmates and other ""friends"" could be meaner than hell, and now with the benefit of 57 years of life realize the meanest, most bullying and stupid kids were frankly mirror images of stupid, mean bullying parents, and were victims of terrible upbringing.     Many had to deal with divorce - Rogers covered that on one show, too - sexual and mental abuse and yet parents were woefully out of synch with them and had no earthly clue what their worlds were really like because in so many cases, they were too selfish, stupid and indifferent toward their children, if not criminal in extreme cases.      This documentary is brilliant in its exploring the life of one of the kindest people to have ever existed.       Everything about Fred Rogers was genuine - the real deal.      After initial resistance after finding out a character on the show was gay, he nonetheless realized he must love and tolerate that person and all people if he or anybody else ever expected to receive the same respect.      It's a very touching documentary.       In this world of extreme hate and senseless violence no message of his love and drive to recognize the good in all of us this movie could not have come at a better time.      But at films' end, there is a short bit of demonstrators at his funeral in 2003 accusing him of being gay (he was not), and tolerating the LGBT community.       FOX News, which is truly the bastion of hate and idiocy disguising itself as a news channel, even stooped to call him evil and criticized Rogers for telling kids that they were fine just as they were and to be happy with their lives.       What the morons at FOX News failed to understand, or refused to so they could be their unnecessarily cruel selves is that without encouragement and belief in one's talents and abilities nobody can succeed, and they accused him of not telling kids to expect to have to work hard to get anywhere.        That is ****       Rogers never implied anything of the kind, and was starting where we all should, with love, compassion and real respect for children, who are, after all, little humans.       FOX News of course is psychopathic in its dealings with the country and fosters hate, encourages stupidity and denigrates all decency wherever it confronts it.             Rogers was mortified after 9-11, and made a few public service statements, but was sick and wouldn't be able to do any more programs.    It is hoped that people who still believe that kindness, intelligence and the will to do good will see this excellent film bio and come away inspired, moved, and more determined than ever to combat hate and stupidity, as we must do in the name of decency.       Fred Rogers is a hero, and must be recognized as such and never forgotten."

Cinematography: 9.111/10 Fred Rogers is a magnetic force on his own. Capturing his story in a documentary is done well and brings his visions (inclusive of everyone taking part in them) forefront to embrace the audience. 

Costume Design: 10/10 Analyzing the design of the characters through the design of their costumes really makes the revolving ideas of Fred Roger's to be deserving of the highest ratings. 

Film Editing: 10/10 The flow branching from Fred Roger's visions really helps guide the documentary so well. The organization makes the information in the documentary more absorbable, tangible, and understanding.

Make-up and Hairstyling: - /10

Sound Editing: 9.453/10 A large part of Fred Roger's visions have been very inclusive of music and their appropriate applications in aspects of his creative projects. The documentary indicates Fred Roger's balance of sound and silence as very important to him though seems to indicate that silence might have more meaning for Fred Roger's than sounds. 

Visual Effects: 10/10 I'm counting the characters, stage, and plots as visual effects. The significance behind all of the assets Fred Rogers put to use is phenomenal.

Story: 10/10 Mister Rogers' Neighborhood gives audience members so many stories that audience members are able to appreciate. The documentary does a great job capturing the essence of Fred Rogers in connection with Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. 

Acting: 10/10 Fred Rogers is authentic and the cast around him seems to be so as well. He epitomizes Matthew 22:37–39 and Leviticus 19:18; simply, Fred Rogers loves his neighbor as he loves himself.

Personal: Fred Rogers is so authentic. He is compassionate, kind, and understanding. I remember watching Mister Rogers' Neighborhood growing up and loving every second. Fred Rogers put himself in a very vulnerable position. To be compassionate, kind, and understanding in public realms is difficult for others to embrace that do not have an upbringing teaching them the many uplifting ways love exists. I'm not religious. I'm spiritual. Still - my understanding and upbringing within the Baptist-Catholic-Christian church environments is so special because not many people are in touch with the ideas of the love which Fred Rogers lives. Even people talking about love send misleading messages about love. The documentary is very well done. I can watch the documentary and the episodes of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood again and again. May his soul continue shining upon the world. 

Overall: 9.794/10

His almost 2000 tv episodes sought not only to entertain but to help those in his young audience to understand the evils of bigotry, the heartbreak of divorce, the challenges of illness and the sadness of death, all topics previously unknown and untouched on children’s television shows. Ordained as a Presbyterian minister Mr. Rogers never preached to his flock but, instead, chose to communicate with them and, by doing so, achieved their love, affection and respect. More than that, Fred Rogers was off the screen the same person he was on it. He lived his every day life believing and espousing that we are all special and that what all of us really want in life is to love, be loved and to be worthy of that affection. I give this film a 10 rating and answer the question in the film’s title in this manner: “Yes, Mr. Rogers, I would have loved to be your neighbor and, even more so, your friend.”"

This doc fosters a greater appreciation of his significance as a TV personality and children's advocate. It explores the dedicated, sweet man whose primary message was one of love and acceptance. There's footage from the decades of his show that's is supplemented by interviews with him, his family and his co-workers. Just like the man, this film doesn't avoid some controversial issues. Ultimately, it's an appealing and illuminating portrait of a much-loved icon."

It's the philosophy of the film's central figure and the truly tear-inducing effects that he had on all the people around him, paired with the filmmaker's unique vision for framing these events that makes it the masterpiece that it is. I hate to be that guy, but this really is a movie that everyone should see, not necessarily to be a better person or anything, but to be reminded that there was and could still be goodness left in this very scary world we live in now."

For 30 years he devoted his life to creating a wholesome television show for kids, not for money or fame, but in a simple yet steadfast belief that early childhood development was the key to raising emotionally healthy individuals.

Though the actual filmmaking of ‘Won’t You Be My Neighbor’ is rather basic, the documentary serves as the perfect balm for today’s troubled soul, detailing the extraordinary life of a man who was driven by one very simple message: that everyone has value—and everyone is to be valued—just the way they are."

As someone who grew up in the last generation to really get to grow up with Mr. Rogers, as well as someone who grew up in and experienced the area of which he lived , it was incredibly touching to see such a nearly immaculate tribute to a man that was very nearly immaculate himself.  Fred's story is a story worth telling for multiple reasons, and this documentary shows why that is.  It echos wholeheartedly his message that he wanted to leave on each and every person; that they can be loved for who they are.  The several interviews by the people who worked with Mr. Rogers, as well as those who were affected by him in one way or another, speak volumes about the man and give new insight into his life that we may not have really been able to see before.  To see the history of his life and his shows made me feel like a kid again, not so much because it was pure nostalgia, but because it's still a show that resonates with me today as an adult.  As I've aged, I began to understand his teachings more in depth and found even more appreciation than I had before, and this film reflects that experience as it shows other's who have been impacted in the ways that I have.  It's a very personal story, one that may leave you feeling emotional if you have any attachment to Mr. Rogers, and maybe you'll be moved even if you didn't.  It does everything that was needed to tell the story of Fred Rogers, and hopefully it gives a chance for younger generations to learn about him."

I watched Mister Rogers' Neighborhood every day when I was a kid. It was just part of my daily routine, as originally decided by my mom, but continued by me because I enjoyed it so much. And in doing so, I guess I formed a bit of a bond with Mr. Rogers, albeit entirely through a television screen. He tackled a wide range of subjects and exposed me to even some adult topics, but did it in a way that didn't make them feel like adult topics. As with most things from my childhood, eventually I stopped watching the show and I really hadn't thought about Mr. Rogers since I was a child. Whenever he's been brought up, I have made sure to mention that I used to watch him and that he was awesome, but I've never revisited his show. So when I heard about this documentary coming out, I was extremely excited. And as I walked into the theater and saw that it was packed (which was surprising, as this is a documentary being shown in an indie theater, after all), I knew it was going to be a special time. The audience was filled with a wide variety of people, and that's because Mr. Rogers didn't impact a certain generation or group of people, he had an impact on people my age (21) all the way to my parents' generation who are in their late 50s. There was just this feeling I had from the moment that the previews started...that I was about to re-live a part of my life that I look back on very fondly, and it really seemed like a lot of the other people in the theater felt the same way. I don't cry while watching movies. It's just something I've never really done. It's not that I have never been emotionally impacted by movies or saddened by certain stories, but I've always been able to keep the tears at bay. That was not the case with this film. Within the first 10 minutes, my eyes were watering hardcore. And there were a few times where I couldn't keep a few tears from trickling down my face. There were several points during the film when it got pretty quiet, and I could hear that several other people in the theater were having a similar experience. It's not that this is simply the greatest documentary ever because it's just an out-of-the-box, original film. It does do a very good job of covering both Mr. Rogers as a person and Mr. Rogers as a TV host, but at it's core it's a pretty textbook documentary. What makes this documentary so incredible to me is the subject, and what that subject means to me. I've never found myself so enthralled by a simple documentary, and I've never found myself wanting a documentary to keep going, and going, and going...like I did with this one. Hell, I stayed seated all the way through the credits, which I don't usually do unless it's a Marvel film. Clearly, Mr. Rogers meant more to me than I ever knew. So, I don't give this film a perfect score because it's necessarily the greatest documentary you or I will ever watch, I have given it a perfect score because it's an experience I'm not sure I'll ever have again while watching a documentary. It was something truly special for me. If you watched Mister Rogers' Neighborhood as a kid, or if you just know about Mr. Rogers, go see Won't You Be My Neighbor? if you get a chance. You might not get quite as emotionally destroyed by it as I was, but you should very much enjoy it."

891,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-handmaiden/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LegitSalt,"Aug 22, 2020",10,"This movie is by far one of the smartest and as most well-made movies of the last decade, and illustrate's the peak of global cinema. Not only is this movie intricately crafted and intensely rewarding, but it has an incredible amount of content to offer and is incredibly visceral. The plot is razor-sharp, and by the movie's final resolution, every twist feels earned and satisfying. The flick runs the gambit on the content that it features, ranging from erotic to dramatic to gory, never overly dwelling on any one subject but also not shying away from showing the extent of abuse and ecstasy of the character's journeys.

	The movie's plot structure is one of great deception, but also great pay off. The first act allows for an introduction to the setting and most of the characters and, while it feels rushed and slightly clunky, this is by design, setting up for the later development of the characters and setting in the following acts. From this point on, the plot turns back on itself, seeming to undo everything already established; this, however, is also revealed to be somewhat of a ruse as the plot ties knots in itself, introducing new dynamics and histories to previously introduced characters. Despite its constant weaving, the movie ultimately plays fair and gives the viewer exactly what they need to understand the characters' motivations and the story's direction. The final act of the film is filled with the height of the film's eroticism and violence tieing up all the loose ends in a satisfactory manner. The tension builds and builds, interspersed with scenes of visceral love and passion, finally ending in a way that brings back many of the introduced elements. While some of the reincorporation is obvious, others are callbacks to moments where the viewer's attention was encapsulated by everything else happening on screen.

	Aside from the structure, the movie also excels in its presentation of its characters and story. The characters are all very deceitful and multifaceted, each having their independent drives that constantly clash, creating the tension that serves to fuel the movie's progression. The acting was spellbinding and often even mesmerizing, Tae-Ri Kim (who played the handmaiden) had so much emotion, compassion, and love imbued within her actions that it was hard to imagine her, existing outside of her character. Min-Hee Kim (Lady Hideko) was similarly emotionally volatile, but hers had an added layer of intricacy due to her character's history of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Both the handmaiden and Lady Hideko are objectified and toyed around for much of the film, but this changes once they come into themselves and realize the extent of their potential empowerment. While the movie is initially about men extorting women, it quickly turns in to women using their perceived subjugation to attain dominance in a hierarchy. The film's main antagonist, Count Fujiwara (played by Jung-woo Ha), is the driving force of the film, and the resolution to his character arc is one the most satisfying of the film.

	The movie, explicitly about the changing dynamics of a subset of characters, is more broadly a look at the relations between Japan and Korea, especially during the Japanese occupation of Korea. Through this lens, the film explores identity and heritage and how the inherited versions of these can impact the way we approach and live our lives. Many of the characters go to great lengths to disown their Korean heritage because, at the time, the Japanese were seen to be the superior culture. To this extent, many of the characters destroy parts of themselves to put on a more socially conforming facade, often doing irreversible damage that causes lasting impacts. The movie suggests that in a climate of heightened deception and discrimination, staying true to one's character and beliefs is one of the most healthy things one can do. The characters' admiration of the traditional Japanese books, specifically during the auction scenes, shows how demented the Korean characters' self-effacement has become within the purview of the film's world. That the wealthy elites hold forged pornographic works to a higher standard than they do the Koreans that posses them is the sole illustrator of this fact.

	The Handmaiden is thought-provoking sensual, but most of all rewarding; despite being over 2.5 hours, I felt constantly engrossed and on the edge of my seat. I would also like to note that the film's depiction of mental health and suicide is rather nuanced and authentic, i.e. they are influenced by the abuse/actions of others and rarely exist solely in a vacuum. Specifically, this is shown when the aunt's suicide was, in reality, a murder. I would recommend this movie to anyone, it has something for everyone and provides more than could ever be asked for."

Those who are into the world cinema, particularly the Korean, knows Park Chan-wook very well. But if you don't, then you must. His films are definitely for the grown ups. Like everybody else, my admiration for his work has started a decade ago with the film 'Oldboy'. He had tried his luck in Hollywood with 'Stoker'. Despite a good entertainer, it was criticised. I love Park Chan-wook doing hundred masterpieces like this in Korea than trying to do one in Hollywood. His ability to turn the good book into a great flick was phenomenal. Here it goes another one. This was based on the British novel 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters. The story of an orphan woman who assigned to be a maid for a young rich woman who is living under the shadow of her uncle since she has no parents.

Yeah, I was expecting it, but I did not think it would be another masterpiece from the director. I even thought the ratings could be exaggerated, and the reviews from his die hard fans like Nolan's or QT's fans does. The timeline of the story was prior to Second World War Korea under the Japan rule. A perfect setting for such theme. The film opened like it is an average film. That's where all I got wrong. Or probably I judged it too soon. The storytelling was split into three parts and the first part was a bit mix of fun and like any film, introduction, the platform for the rest of the narration filled with surprises.

The young orphan Sook-hee was recruited by a thief who is planning to trick a young woman named Lady Hideko with all the wealth left behind by her parents. The only obstacle for him is her uncle, a guardian. So Sook-hee becomes close to her. More than she had expected, but their plan is working. Now they have to wait for the perfect moment for a perfect strike. When it arrives, an unexpected twist takes the tale to go back to where the film originally had started. But even further earlier and this time, the perspective of the story was from the Lady Hdeko.

❝So even if my love for you leads me to ruin, don't pity me.❞

So, with that flashback, the second part begins. But literally it was a series of twist, that keep explaining us in another angle of the whole scenario I had witnessed in the previous part. Believe me, I have never seen such a long twist before. I was like unmoved for that entire segment. One of the best things I have ever in a film. The praise must go to the author, but the director and his actors as well did a fine job. There's a twist in every scene. So, for that one must pay close attention to the first part, despite slow moving story.

But above all, what I'm surprised was I did not know it was a lesbian film. Moreover, I did not think it could have bold scenes for such theme. Everything seemed perfect. I mean the erotic parts are sensual, but very artistic than unnecessary disturbance. Mainly because of stronger hold of the story narration than anything else. Even the pace picks up, like a crazy speed. Everything about the film you would learn in this section. All the secrets of the past revealed and what might comes are still kept under mysterious for the third and final part.

The most awaited, the conclusion part begins forth. For everything we saw so far, what might come after makes this film at its best. Just like the mid part, this is also full of twists. Because it will going to tell who ends where and what they get. Over two hours long film, and every frame are worth. The casting was best and so the setting of the 1930s Korea. Especially I must applaud the filmmaker's effort to turn the original setting from Europe to East Asia. It was great, but still now and then you can see the influence of the original source. I mean western culture, names, architect references which might have come from the book.

Not just the lesbian or a love triangle story, but something like a circle of love with deceive and defraud. You can notice that in the film poster with four main characters. So when it has a multiple strings attached, you could expect surprises/twists from each angle and it gives that more the convincingly. Put this into your must see list. This is not the first screen adaptation, but surely the best so far. Now we can expect a European or a Hollywood project in a big scale soon. Believe me the Oscars would pour in, because it's that kind of story. Highly recommended!

Trotzdem ist der überlange Film durch Chan-wooks westliche Prägung immer kurzweilig – und sieht nebenbei auch ganz fantastisch aus."
901,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-handmaiden/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Spangle,"Feb 8, 2017",8,"Woof. The Handmaiden is one perverse piece of eroticism. An erotic thriller that shows mastery of suspense akin to Alfred Hitchcock, but with a blending of eroticism akin to Brian De Palma, Paul Verhoeven, or Adrian Lyne, The Handmaiden is a brutally violent and erotic film. Blending eroticism with extreme violence like that found in films such as Basic Instinct, The Handmaiden is a lovingly crafted film that is equal parts horrifying and titillating throughout its run time. Though it suffers from Park Chan-wook's films always feeling too distant and disconnected (personal opinion), The Handmaiden's stark beauty is impossible to deny and this is what lifts it above his other films for me. That said, the plot's suspense and thrills are secondary to the visual beauty of this film, which is striking.

Changing the novel's location from Victorian England to Korea under Japanese rule, Park Chan-wook's film still feels Victorian. With the regality and the building design often reflecting the castles and mansions one could find in Victorian England, The Handmaiden still shows that influence. Yet, of course, these buildings are entirely Japanese/Korean. The interior design reflects this in the home of Uncle Kouzuki (Cho Jin-woong), as it is entirely Japanese and feels like something one could find in a film by Akira Kurosawa. Lavish, regal, and alive in its own rights, these buildings are intricate, detailed, and absolutely lovely. The interior and the exterior are gorgeous with the camera finding just the right ways to capture this beauty. Often shooting from behind the trees, the home is usually somewhat obscured in the darkness, instilling an ominous feeling about this place. The trees add to the distance communicated by the entire film, as Park Chan-wook never fully let's you in and keeps you an arm's length away from the proceedings. This is captured in the cinematography, but even then, the visuals are strikingly gorgeous.

This production design is further felt by the aforementioned cinematography that takes full advantage of the beauty on display. Every shot is gorgeous and lovingly crafted. Not a single frame of this film feels out of place and really flows together and is entirely engrossing. This is a dark, disturbing film, but the visuals communicate an odd beauty and romance to this violence and disturbing level of sexuality. Of course, it is benefited by the framing and staging. Every moment is precise, definitive, and decisive. Not a foot is put wrong in this film where each actor communicating their character brilliantly and breathing life into the film with every step they take. It is the movement of the characters that makes this a full-fledged visual masterpiece as it manages to add yet another layer to visual approach of this film. Beyond the production design, staging, and cinematography, the costume design is also brilliant with each design representing the lavish and royal lifestyle of its characters. The design's are intricate, well put together, and lovely to look at throughout the film.

Though an erotic psychological thriller with a penchant for violence and disturbing moments, The Handmaiden is also darkly comedic. For instance, one such comedy scene finds Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri) holding up Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee) to prevent her from hanging herself. Upon learning distressing news, she runs off to cry only to quickly realize she has left her Ladyship strangling herself from the branch. Additionally, the multiple depictions of tentacles and the octopus in the basement are hysterical tongue-in-cheek additions by Park. And of course, the scene where Hideko has intercourse - supposedly - with a knife. Really off-the-wall, uncensored, and truly outrageous moments that add some darkly comic twists to a film that is dark, dark, dark.

Sexually, The Handmaiden is very much like a Verhoeven film. Though more pristine and less gritty, the scenes are shot to titillate. Park Chan-wook exploits his seemingly lesbian characters for the enjoyment of male viewers with classic lesbian sex scenes occurring that, regardless of their practicality, exist solely to entertain the male audience. This is very much like what people like De Palma or Verhoeven would include in their film, though it would be shot differently. Park Chan-wook's stages these sex scenes almost symmetrically at times and very rigidly. The scenes are tense, sensual, and almost regal is how they appear and look. It feels more like a Todd Haynes sex scene from Carol in this regard, as it feels pristine. Now, of course, Haynes' lesbian sex moment is far more withdrawn and focused on the passion and love. It is intimate, not exploitative. The Handmaiden exploits its characters' sexuality for the purposes of male entertainment, which is a shame."

Meanwhile their story is told with delicious twists and among fantastically beautiful sets – a feast for the eye and for anyone with a deep sense of irony."

905,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-handmaiden/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Reginthorn,"Dec 30, 2016",9,"Park Chan-wook is one of the most versatile directors around. Sure, Park seems fixated on tales of vengeance but never does the worn theme feel like a detractor in his films. Oldboy and Snowpiercer add intricate layers which transform the initial quest for revenge into other issues entirely. The Handmaiden is a movie that keeps the best traits of the South Korean director. Sure revenge underlines the narrative and yet the film is not entirely about revenge. Likewise, the Handmaiden is an erotic thriller and isn’t an erotic thriller. A lesser director would hone in on the pornographic but the film never undercuts one of the meta-messages found within the film. Without spoiling Handmaiden, a Clockwork Orange is a film with a similar meta-commentary directed at the audience. Instead, the erotic scenes give the intended effect without going full throttle. The result is a lesbian love story which accentuates emotion over physicality. Male directors have a tendency to get a little excited with lesbian love stories and turn an otherwise amazing movie into pornography. Blue is the Warmest Color is a recent example of a film which could have utilized a little restraint required of its subject matter. The central “love triangle” in the Handmaiden is given an air of realism due to the level of restraint. Most characters are never who they appear to be throughout the film. In fact, the three chapter structure of the film allows for the rare successful attempt at having more than one plot twist. Film veterans are likely the only group of people who can put the puzzle pieces together early on. The twists never come across as cheap gimmicks thanks to the cinematography. The gorgeous mise en scene is spellbinding with the amount of variation found in limited locations. In spite of the lavish designs, the camera never hides character ticks one can begin to hone in on. The Handmaiden contains a lot of the admirable traits one might in a Stanley Kubrick film (the Clockwork Orange reference is not entirely pulled out of a hat). However, the middle-aged Korean director is able to separate and maybe transcend Kubrick in his use of overt dark humor. Manchester by the Sea is another serious film which also successfully utilizes humor to create a humanistic story. Kubrick usually utilizes dark comedy for an entirely different effect. The Handmaiden is an absolutely must-see for those who appreciate cinematic greatness."
906,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-handmaiden/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DirigiblePulp,"Dec 14, 2016",9,"Breathtakingly gorgeous; every composition, from the settings, designs, costumes, to the music and the actors -- the entirety of the mise en scène -- is absolute perfection.

A film of twists and turns that are earned because the plot works so well from scene to scene. You don't spend the entire film trying to outguess it but instead are so enraptured by it that it can take you by surprise.

It's also a provocation, one that rides the line between exploitation and art quite daringly. You can justify good chunks of what happens in here, but maybe not all of it (or the extent of it). But taken as a cathartic release from the tyranny of a patriarchal society (and also the Japanese occupation of Korea, which is a subtext I won't pretend to completely understand) it is fitting and has its own brazen clarity. Look on my works, ye Mighty and **** you don't get to touch."

I loved the book and the BBC adaptation way back when. Park's version definitely takes some liberties with the plot, and in some ways better than the original. However he also goes a bit graphic, kinky & gratuitous (e.g. you can tell it's a dude directing with some key sex scenes) and things get almost comic-booky, but I still totally enjoyed it and he definitely captures the solid romance that underlies Fingersmith. There's some real comedy in there as well which was totally surprising and perfect. The cinematography was absolutely stunning. If you have a chance to see this movie in theaters, do it."

Film her ne kadar erotik psikolojik-gerilim olarak çıksa da bunun ötesinde bir iş koymuş ortaya. Açıkçası filmlerde gereksiz erotik sahneler gördüğümde o sahneleri geçen biriyim. Bu yüzden yönetmeni sevsem de film için pek beklentiye girmemiştim. Ama filmi izleyince gördüm ki ortaya gerçekten iyi bir iş koymuş. Entrikalarla dolu güzel bir hikâye, kaliteli sinematografi ve muazzam müziklerle seyir keyfi yüksek bir film oluşturmuş. Film herkesin kaldırabileceği bir film değil, bu yüzden herkese tavsiye edemeyeceğim. Ama daha önce Chan-wook Park'ın bir filmini izleyip sevdiyseniz bu filmi mutlaka tavsiye ederim.

The direction is one of the most outstanding feats of the film, as the colour and culture are so glorious displayed through it. The music becomes more lively in the film's context, even understandable when it fails to do so on its own, but it often leaves place for refinery. The attention to detail is difficult to miss. But that isn't to say that it isn't just as free. That is, the musical transitions really show Beyonce's own growth as an artist but the emotion behind it all is really what leaves you more appreciative of her art and more respectable towards the portrayed culture (which is ultimately the intention). It is quite heart-wrenching.

The film is certainly a message for change and this is greatly encapsulated from the onset. The poetry, the The Lion King references, the clever metaphorical nuances, the collaborators and styles of music accompanied by the distinct choreography are just some of the few ways in which Beyonce influences our landscape again."

The deadly virus, that we are all familiar with, has changed our view of a ""normal world"" for better or worse, maybe both.

The documentary follows patients and medical workers battling the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, as early as January of 2020. It all boils down human error. The error of not containing it. The error of not acting fast enough. The error of not informing your people. The error in human beings, where selfishness and cruelty become another form of disease. The errors of everything. Even though it is devastating to watch, but there's strangely a sense of hope to it. Like, there's light at the end of the tunnel. What can't go to it, but it will come to us, slowly and eventually.

968,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,ralphrahal,"Feb 16, 2025",7,"Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood is a signature Tarantino film, packed with big names, stylish direction, and a deep love for old-school Hollywood. The plot? Well, it’s more of a wandering journey than a structured story. Things happen, characters interact, but there isn’t much tying it all together in a traditional sense. That’s expected from Tarantino, he’s more about moments than narratives. The slow-paced intro sets the tone, but it doesn’t really pick up in a way that makes you feel a sense of urgency.

The directing is classic Tarantino, with his trademark long conversations, sudden bursts of energy, and, of course, his obsession with feet. The cinematography nails the late '60s aesthetic, from the lighting to the vintage sets, making Hollywood feel alive in every frame. Camera work is bold, sometimes chaotic, but never dull. Acting-wise, DiCaprio and Pitt carry the film effortlessly, delivering performances that feel natural and engaging. The sheer number of recognizable faces adds to the spectacle, making every scene feel like a who’s who of Hollywood.

The script has its moments, sharp dialogue and some solid character work, but the comedy often feels forced rather than organic. The soundtrack, however, is one of the film’s strongest elements, blending iconic tracks that perfectly fit the era and mood. Overall, it’s an experience more than a story, and while the pacing drags at times, the world it builds is captivating enough to keep you watching. I wouldn’t call it a masterpiece, but it’s an enjoyable ride if you’re in the mood for something that values atmosphere and performances over a tightly woven plot."

But it also stands out as being the least substantial out of all of his work.

The already simple plot gets lost among so many meandering scenes that seem to be there just to look pretty. They do look pretty, they look amazing, actually, but they do give out a sense of self indulgense on the part of the director. Most storylines in the movie go nowhere, and the weird tonal shift in the end reminded me of Unglorious ****, another weak link in Tarantino's filmography.

The movie was released in 2019 and was well-received by critics. The movie starred Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and Margot Robbie.

In my point of view, this movie needs to be watched at least because it mirrors the particular period of American history. It guides the audiences through the atmosphere of 1969. This movie raises acute questions that worry and cause a stir the minds of people nowadays too. Great acting and wonderful script unconditionally attract attention to this picture.

Critics love Tarantino because he loves cinema and they can associate with that, and they get all of his references, which can be lost on your average viewer. It is the same reason movies set in LA often get a few noms or wins during Oscar season that many would call questionable. This is not to detract from Tarantino's talent. The man is a great writer, though as of late he has become a blowhard. Scripts are long and drawn out, and then they all crash into an ending that seems tacked on rather than built to which begs the question does he even know where he is going with his films anymore. It is not visionary, it is repetitive and showing very little sign of growth. He is a craftsman who carves an excellent movie each time, but they are more or less the same.

DE: Tarantino runs a decent ship, and Hollywood is no different. Everything seems to be on point. Every department is hitting its marks, and we are building a tale in his distinct (if that is the right word) style. In terms of editing, the loss of Sally Menke can be felt in every one of his films since she passed. She somehow was able to contain him and give a better structure. Though from seeing her works outside of the Tarantino verse, you can see he had an equal part in elevating her. Together they were able to take his longwinded approach and make it come off with a steady pace and allow decent investment from the audience, but now however that is slipping away at a fast pace with each subsequent film.

W: Tarantino is one of the great writers, he is not on Miyazaki's or Anderson's level, but he is undoubtedly on the same level as the Coen brothers or Bong Joon-ho. Which is not a level to sniff at, but the problem with Tarantino's writing is that he may have switched genres, but he has not adapted to it. More that he has made another Tarantino movie with a new shell on it. Which is great, but if I wanted to see the same thing as before I might as well watch the classics. It is sort of like a band doing a new tour 20 years later trying to flog the new stuff that sounds far too similar to the old stuff, and the fans would much rather prefer to hear the hits.

C: Have you seen a Tarantino, Scorsese or Oliver Stone movie? Then guess what you have seen Robert Richardson's work and along with it some iconic shots that have littered avatars and uni students bedrooms for decades. His outing this time is impressive, though it might not match a level that he created. That said the lens seems to tell more of a story here than Tarantino's writing, which tells you everything you need to know.

A: Acting is stereotypically cartoonish, but that has become a standard for Tarantino. Though Pitt's depiction of the more sane character throughout this 2D world of actors stands out. Sadly given the cast, we are working with, and the sheer level of talent coupled with the extent in which we examine these characters lives it feels underwhelming, and each one is more an allegory than a persona in their own right.

S: As strange as it seems the sound department is usually one of the reasons I watch a Tarantino film. Since Inglourious Basterds someone in the sound department is getting an Oscar nom, whether it is music, mixing or editing. Without fail Hollywood continues this trend. Just excellent.

PD: This film is not pretending to be the 1960s, it is the 1960s. I know you have seen many a period piece, and they all do a decent job, but it is the subtle nuances and the dirt that make the difference. This is not a glossy veneer trying to rewrite a section of history, this is just trying to capture an era for better or worse. This may be down to the fact that Tarantino is obsessed with the period and only a slight glance at his oeuvre would back this notion up.

BA: The costume design, while simple is also great, it catches the style of the era without feeling like it is overexaggerating the form or the zeitgeist of the time. The visual effects in the latter portion of the film while jarring are quite well done and stand out.

EVO: It is not one of Tarantino's ""funner"" films, which is odd given that it is a bright nostalgia backed film told from the perspective of mostly positive souls. If you are a Tarantino completest, you are going to want to see it, but for many, the question of why did I sit through that for 3 hours will ring true on the lips, and while the film is crafted brilliantly I cannot help but finding myself siding with them."

Remarkable consistency in delivering great dramas. If you are a drama film fan without the language barrier, then you must have seen at least a couple of films of Hirokazu Koreeda. Less than a year ago I saw his new arrival 'Our Little Sister'. Despite not overwhelmingly impressed with that, I won't say that I did not enjoy it. I always fascinated with the realistic portrayal, but the points should be executed so well than leaving empty scenes and dialogues, and calling it an art film. This one was much better. The first impression was okay, but after giving some time between my watch and writing this review, I kind of started to like it more.

First of all, this story was not new for me. I have already seen a few similar themed films from other parts of the world, particularly in Hollywood. But none of them were as serious as this one while narrating its tale. The storyline was simple, entirely focused on a family, fighting on stumbling marriage. It was a long introduction, particularly aimed at a father, like how he messed up in his life with gambling. But opening few minutes made him look like a man of example. Only in the following event you would know how deep his troubles are.

Other than his family, his work field was introduced to us. Being a writer, but for a few quick bucks working as a private eye on his part time, he misuses the opportunity with his loyal friend. Once the film reaches the half way mark, the focus shifts back to the family where the remaining story takes place. It was a stormy day and they all gather in his mother's apartment. This is where everything will be cleared out, whether the marriage will be saved or not. But the mother's one final push as it seems planned perfectly, would it deliver a result is what you should watch it to learn.

?I wonder why it is that men can't love the present. Either they just keep chasing whatever it is they've lost, or they keep dreaming beyond their reach.?

You can't doubt Hiroshi Abe's presence. He was perfect along with Kirin Kiki, whose a few films I've seen before, but only started to notice recently with her amazing performance from 'Sweet Bean'. The casting looked great, and the locations. I always like films about elderly people, especially to highlight their struggle. And most of the Japanese films I have seen on that concept were just like the way I wanted. Maybe because there are lots of aging people in Japan than anywhere else. Just kidding.

Obviously dialogues are very important for a film and there were many good lines spoken. At one point in the final stage, it flips towards sentiments. Very touching conversation, particularly coming from an old and experienced woman, which is definitely worth taking heed. This is a family film. Despite about a marriage crisis, there is no speculation, like twist and turns. Interesting enough with its plain narration. True to its title and when the title part comes into play, that's where it gets its peak. With its nearly two hours runtime, the pace was acceptable, but patience needed for those got trouble with long films.

This is the film about our life, that we can try for what we want to be, but achieving it not easy, not everybody would succeed that. Accepting the fact, as life my go on was the message. Incredible writing and direction. Feels like straight out of a book, it's an original screenplay though. Surely you don't want to miss this film, from this director. Because if you do, it is equal to failing to watch the latest Woody Allen film. Only he's a Japanese version. My final words are the director already made his masterpiece(s), but still it is near to one compared to the international cinemas. So I'm not saying it is a must, but surely worth a try.

This doc offers opportunities to watch him work on his incredible creations. Fortunately, there's lots of footage that provides bits of insight, which is supplemented by interviews with family, friends and co-workers. It's fascinating to see him rise from struggling and scrappy to the leader of more than one major fashion house. Sadly, the constant darkness that hangs over his life dominates the story , so much so that it starts to drag down the momentum in the final third (the extended segment on Isabella Blow's death didn't help). Even so, the filmmakers have used some interesting animations to symbolize various parts of McQueen's career and they've effectively told the story of this fascinating and sad artist."

Although you hear from his family and his colleagues, this documentary is mainly (and thankfully) about the fashion he created, which was really amazing. The only fault is that the documentary slows down at the end. Once the charismatic McQueen dies, the film loses its energy and fascination. The film should have ended immediately after McQueen’s death, rather than continuing with eulogies from family and friends, whose presence and ideas pale so obviously in comparison to the energy and genius of McQueen himself."

In turn, the problem for documentarians is trying to create a piece of work that lives up to the real-life hype.  Co-directors Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui have done an admirable job at capturing the light-and-dark duality of the designer's extraordinary career.  However, the first half of the documentary was so zoomed in on everything they were featuring on screen that it's actually burdensome on the eyes, and the rest of the film, while certainly worth the price of admission, is far less groundbreaking than the man they set out to memorialize."

The party scenes are a bit cliche and there are the inevitable sex references and strong language but there are one or two somewhat poignant moments and it felt a bit more genuine than other similar films. Its definitely primarily a comedy and its somewhat amusing but not especially hilarious. It felt, to me, overall, a relatively good film, with some nice moments and so I'd say its worth a watch but if your really not keen on teenage party based films then this may not be for you.

It is an amazing teen comedy of our ages. There is never a single dull moment throughout. It showcases Olivia Wilde's talent as a director. The core theme of the film feels so authentic and relatable. It takes us on a nostalgic ride by deeply exploring the beauty of high school friendships and their complications. Also the story excels at so many levels and is backed up by great performances. The multiple awkward jokes are all so incredibly hilarious and play so well with the context. I would absolutely recommend this for anyone.

With unexpected story elements reminiscent of buddy cop films and outrageous road trip tales, this incisively scripted, creatively shot, superbly designed Independent Spirit Award winner for best first feature defies all of the cliches of the teenage comedy genre while simultaneously skewering the inane offerings that have come typify such pictures, all without becoming mean, gross, stereotypical or stupid. The impeccably assembled ensemble, led by Kaitlyn Dever and Golden Globe nominee Beanie Feldstein, works together like a well-oiled machine, firing on all cylinders and delivering authentic performances without becoming trite, overly cynical or amateurish. The rapid-fire humor, reminiscent of screwball comedies, will keep viewers in stitches throughout, even in some inventive fantasy sequences that integrate perfectly into the main narrative without becoming clumsy, inappropriate or out of place. I truly can't say enough good things about this one, but I would recommend going directly to the film itself and skipping the preview that vastly undersold it."

Olivia Wilde has managed to make a fresh picture with her own voice and variety and yet with a retro vibe.

Sure it gets a little out of hand here and there for a laugh, but almost none of it feels 'low-blow' like films such as Superbad.  Great cameos from Lisa Kudrow and a few SNL greats. Beanie Feldstein (Molly) might be one of the most charming young actresses of our time.  She'll be winning Oscars for dramas in 15 years. So talented and so realistic. Just a stellar performance in a well written coming of age comedy that relies less on shock value and more on tugging at the heart.  Think Superbad meets last years Eighth Grade.

Booksmart is loaded with laughs and will have you truly in stitches with just how funny it is, but at its core there's so much care, nuance, and heart at the center of this beautiful teen comedy. It's vulgar and obscene in nature, but you begin to truly develop a closeness to Amy and Molly and by the end of the film you'll probably want sequels and merchandise surrounded around the two - Beanie and Kaitlyn are stars giving two of my favorite performances of the year. But the nucleus of Booksmart is first time director Olivia Wilde. Olivia Wilde uses the camera like a genuine master. Wilde is never being too intrusive or judgemental of her characters, it's near perfect direction and it gives the film this raw tenacity and authenticity that juxtaposes perfectly against the ludicrous comedy and immaturity of it all. The fantasy sequences are truly dazzling and cartoonish which add to the sense of ridiculousness of the film. Although it does get quite messy narratively, Booksmart is a gorgeously rendered film that delicately balances moments of sentimentality and bold female comedy that exceeds the typical cliches of its genre by being fresh and carefully stitched together by a truly talented team."

1070,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/booksmart/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TrevorsView,"Jun 21, 2019",7,"To quote emperor Palpatine, “A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.” Upon seeing a red rating screen before the trailer for Booksmart, it seems to be yet another crass comedy that can’t draw the fine line between rules and fun. Turns out director Olivia Wilde’s motion picture actually has some profound philosophies to say when it’s time to party these coming summer months.

The screenwriter wisely took time to build up the homosexuality of the co-lead, Amy, so that by the end, her story makes the LGBTQ community feel respected. Yes, even I, a straight man, felt heartbroken when Amy did; mostly because the actress playing her, Kaitlyn Dever, knows how to play the part seriously when admitting how she profanes a plush panda’s snout, then snaps a vicious attitude toward those who take advantage of her habit of saying yes to everything.

Her perfectionist best friend, Molly, though, is the type of lead character who gives the entire project more layers of depth than similar comedies. While not correcting grammar on bathroom walls, Molly‘s assertive (emphasis on the first three letters of that adjective) female dog personality barks everyone else down. Beanie Feldstein plays the part of Molly like the only sane woman within a murder mystery party, but not even she, nor the rest of the cast, acts truly heterosexual!

Casting directors out there, keep a keen eye out on Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever! These two build expert chemistry off each other, almost like the two improvised half the content… maybe Beanie and Kaitlyn could score Best Actress Golden Globe nominations? Fingers crossed!

Although the unorthodox immorality of the screenplay encourages youths to dishonor the police and ignore their parents. Don’t be surprised if someone shortly after watching this movie is photographed to the front and to the side, a number below in hand. Right from seeing how Molly vandalized her own parking spot at school, the complete freedom of breaking rules means even the rules of logic are broken. There’s an instant when the two lead girls speak fluent Chinese so the principal cannot understand them, and nothing before or after the scene explains why they would know such a language. Better scenes probably wound up on the cutting room floor to close up some plot holes, but instead, the bigger issues are peppered down by the unpredictably spicy visuals.

The cinematography doesn’t quite match what the hot imagery calls for, as it ranges from Steadicam to going all vertigo on Molly’s distraught face. With the things done wrong, several jokes go on too long, including Amy’s parents listing the cute names for her graduation food, a creepy doll nightmare, or a fantasized dance with Molly’s crush. That dance is just another one of those invigorous daydreams implemented. While hit or miss, when a visual does hit, it is oh, so fresh! Right down to the makeup design of the characters, it appropriately gives crucial information about who they are without calling any attention to itself.

Because everything looks genuine enough, the supporting cast are believable as videos on an Instagram story, shouting louder than a saturated karaoke projector backlight. At school, the students seem well-behaved, then after the scholarly caps set loose, shirts rip apart to reveal their true selves! Every character leaves an impact, from a full-of-themselves drama duo to a trashy teenager in a teacher’s body. Over eight hours, the entire collection of whomever impacted Molly and Amy throughout their four years of high school jumps in line of their misadventures.

Molly ain’t entirely happy though, as a big problem keeps coming in: Too many of these party-hardy kids got into her level of schools: Yale, Harvard, etc. That’s why Molly needs to party on their last night of teenagerhood, to prove she’s more than just their class president. Not just that, she’ll ensure Amy will enjoy it too, even if it means introducing her to porn for “educational” purposes.

This inner concern Molly has for her own ego presents something much deeper than what most coming-of-age teen comedies dwell on, it displays something applicable to anyone of any age: why “YOLO” vitalizes humanity now more than ever before. It means we should go love those privileged breaks life offers. It means we need to have some fun. It means we need to follow the rules. It means we have to know when the line between fun and rules must be drawn or erased. Booksmart has the fun part down cold, so take good note on the journey of Molly and Amy."

Two years later the French version of the ACT UP organization opened in 1989.

The main purpose of ACT UP was to take direct action to end the AIDS crisis and demonstrating for greater, faster access to experimental drugs.

The film opens with a demonstration at a drug company and leads into a local ACT UP meeting where the rules are explained to four newcomers such as snapping fingers instead of clapping or saving all debating for the meeting room, not in the hall where they go to have a cigarette. The meetings are attended by males, females, some being HIV+ and others negative, straights, gays, drug users, who have full blown AIDS.

The horror of what the government didn’t do for many years and the horror of watching vibrant people being decimated by a disease that is still killing people over 35 years later is shown with fingers being pointed at all, even with their infighting at meetings.

Intermingled with facts, figures, marches, condom and needle distributions, walls splattered with fake blood, a mother’s horror finding that she has been injecting her son, a hemophiliac, with infected bold provided by a hospital is a love story.

At that first meeting, where we observe the ACT UP group, one of the newcomers, Nathan, played by Arnaud Valois, HIV- negative, zeros in on Sean (Nahuel Perez Biscayart) a firebrand, militant leader who has AIDS.  (An aside: as Nathan tells Sean about his first love the lover’s name is Arnaud!) We follow them as they at first fall in love and then dealing with Sean’s illness.

Most of the actors are new faces, such as Biscayart and Valois, which adds a little confusion at the beginning and it may take some time to realize that Marco, the hemophiliac, played by Theophile Ray, is the son of Helene, Catherine Vinatier. We meet Jeremie, Ariel Borenstein, ACT UP president Thibault, Antoine Reinartz, and other ACT UP members, plus a drug company CEO Samuel Churin, Sean’s mother Saadia Ben Taieb among a strong supporting cast.

The film, directed by Robin Campillo, who also co-wrote it with Philippe Mangeot, based up the former’s experiences as an ACT UP participant, is the French Oscar contender for the 2018 Best Foreign Language  film.

“BPM” is one the best films ever made about AIDS but has a few minor faults and one major fault. The latter is the 2 hours and 44 minutes running time along with faulty editing and slow pace.

Being a French film the two sex scenes are vivid while the last twenty minutes are very moving. The problem is that there are too many unnecessary scenes such as 3 disco scenes when one would have sufficed, one too many marches, a beach scene that adds nothing to the love story and so on, taking away from getting to know some of the characters better.

“BMP” is a must see movie even though it may be hard to watch at times and the love story is completely believable!"

Brought back so many memories. Fantastic film in every way! It was very difficult watching at times, but, a very important period of history that should not be forgotten. Easily one of the best films I have seen this year. Highly recommended!"

It shows how a loving community can come together and make their voices heard. Great acting, direction, writing, stakes and message."
1084,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/bpm-beats-per-minute/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MichaelObe,"Oct 20, 2017",8,"In the early 1990s, the AIDS epidemic in France reached its peak. Not indifferent Paris activists, members of the Act Up movement, organize street demonstrations, trying to resist the established silence in society and the reluctance of pharmaceutical companies to share research results.
Being in the past an activist of such a movement, director Robin Kampillo creates an almost documentary portrait of the era when the desire to live, not survive, was spoken out loud. The film does not just talk about the problem of HIV infection, it screams about it. Loud and clear. That is why it is more painful to perceive that little has changed in more than twenty years.
Kampillo, from the very first scene, throws us into the thick of events, allowing us to become a viewer of the debates about methods of dealing with the suppression of the issue. Here the are: a self-confident Sophie (Adele Haenel), criticizing Sean (Nahuel Pérez Biscayart) and Max (Félix Maritaud) for overly aggressive methods, and imagining himself the leader Thibault (Antoine Reinartz), for whom any appearance on TV is already a victory. In this audience there are also newcomers, among whom Nathan (Arnaud Valois), who care about the fate of AIDS patients, and they are ready to help in organizing any protest action. The director does not divide the guys on the right and the guilty, the voice of everyone is important here, after all, the main thing - what are you manifesting, and not with what.
If in ""Philadelphia"" Jonathan Demme show AIDS too Hollywood, and Gus Van Sant in ""Milk"" told the story of one person through the prism of the struggle for freedom, the French ""Beats per minute"" is closest to the British drama ""Pride""(2014), about the campaign ""Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners"". Kampillo succeeded in alternating important protests scenes and intimate episodes of the relationship between the two heroes. Neither long timing nor episodic publicism do not make it difficult to perceive the picture not only as a film-action, but also as a personal statement of a real participant of already distant events."
1085,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/heart-of-a-dog/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DawdlingPoet,"Nov 24, 2021",7,"I liked that this documentary film has quite an eery sound to it, a somehow supernatural, ethereal type of sound. The narrators voice sounds quite contemplative and so it has a laid back feel to it, while also sounding somewhat matter of fact as well. I struggled to think how to describe it visually but then the term scrapbook came to mind - it is like an artsy scrapbook of sorts, I say arty as there are elements of art the narrator has presumably worked on, which appear, like drawings, art installations and the like. Its a thoughtful documentary, covering some reasonably deep topics. There are some interesting quotes shown on screen.

As someone who likes dogs, I appreciated some of the sentiments and enjoyed seeing the many dogs that appear on screen. There are philosophical moments present (with people such as Kierkegaard mentioned) and indeed some of the themes are more about humans than pets or dogs. Overall I enjoyed this - its a slightly surreal watch but it was a nice one all the same. Oh and watching the Jack Russell play the keyboard was really cute! (yes I did just say that). I suppose, aside from grief, you could say its primarily about love and hope, which is obviously more positive. Would I recommend it? yes I would, primarily to other fans of dogs."
1086,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/heart-of-a-dog/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,AndrewBurge,"Oct 2, 2018",9,"There are better films than Laurie Anderson's 'Heart of a Dog'. But no other film packs such a condensed initial emotional punch. It is personal, so intimate yet so ambitious, and keeps its acute focus despite transitioning through so many subjects. All relevant, all mysterious and all scary.

First of all, Laurie Anderson is a performance and visual artist. And while its easy to smirk at its apparent self-indulgence and pretentiousness, every single word she utters is delivered with a perfectly balanced wry, never delving into satire, but most importantly, never victimizing herself. It is extremely empowering seeing a Septuagint widow baring her soul and focusing on remembering so many dark moments: the deaths of her husband Lou Reed and her apparently estranged mother, the downward spiral life and eventual death of her loved rat terrier Lolabelle, her near-fatal accident jumping in a pool, the world-changing 9/11 attacks and mostly her most twisted and deepest fantasies.

One of these, being right at the beginning, where she describes having ""engineered"" Lolabelle to be put into her stomach so that she could give birth to it. She is aware how sick that is, but she does not care. Every single word, musical hum and story she says is carefully written. She hides her desperation in her controlled tone, yet she is fascinated with death studying Buddhism, searching understatement and closure in old philosophies and eventually realizing that peace comes when you stop focusing on yourself. Indeed, there are no proper conclusions about life, death and love, because the truth is we do not know anything.

All in all, this is one of those films which simply want you to experience art in its purest form. The entire soundtrack is basically the film converted in audio format. It goes to show that Anderson is committed to challenging herself and putting her art before anything. This is a great film, the soundtrack is a masterpiece."

You can feel the brain put into it, the attention to details, the strong storytelling, those flawless performances, gut wrenching and nerve-racking sequences. A Separation may still be my favorite Farhadi movie but I'm not sure if I like this more or About Elly. I could feel Kieslowski's spirit in the ending of the movie (it reminded my three colors blue) and of course you wouldn't be surprised to find out Asghar Farhadi likes Agatha Christie.

1089,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/aferim!/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"Feb 24, 2016",9,"Adventurous,  funny, thrilling and shocking!

The second movie for me from this director after a beautiful child custody dramedy, 'Everybody in Our Family'. This was totally different, a historical theme that takes place 200 years early to the present. This is a black and white flick that perfectly blends with the timeline of the narration. The Romania's submission for the 2016's Oscars. I have not seen all the foreign movie nominees, but having seen the out of the contest films like this and Brasil's 'The Second Mother', they are a lot better than the actually in the race film, 'A War'.

Coming to this movie, I was almost certain that I wasn't going to write a review after knowing about it through the trailer and the synopsis despite good ratings and praised by the critics. Because I felt this must be a boring kind, so was thinking to get over with it. Like there's a saying, don't judge a book by its cover, it happened right here for me with this movie. So this is where I realised after the watch that the Academy Awards was totally wrong for snubbing it. In fact, this was one of the best foreign movies I have seen in the last six months or so.

""When a wise man opens his mouth, open your ear.""

They might have had a solid reason for that, that I don't know, but my guess is the film's ending. The opening was slow, the dialogues were loud, but sometime foolishly funny and sometimes wisely funny. Overall you must pay close attention, so that you can enjoy jokes. Definitely a wonderful adventure, like any other man hunt films, this was so serious on that affair, but viewers won't realise that till the final scene. A well supported music throughout to tell an incredible tale about two men on the mission who meet different people, land, culture and language.

It is 1835, in the Eastern Europe region, Wallachia, the father-son duo from the police force on a trail to track down a runaway slave. They must go beyond their territorial limits to find him. On their way, they came forwards to the people they just met needed help, and vice versa, After the intense search they grab him in the remote place, but his version of the story to flee differs. So what comes later is the final act and a very shocking conclusion.

""Fear is shameful, but healthy. It's God's gift.""

Not so interested to very into it is something that I was not expected. The reason was obvious it was funnier than I thought. Besides that, I was uncomfortable with the slavery theme. It's turning me off from having a good time and beginning to concern. But that's how the old world was, as it was based on the old documents and texts of the real event. After that horrifying finale, the bold statement from the father to son that goes like this 'God, even looks after worms and we can't look after each other' is what made me think we had come a long way since, yet do everything has changed now? And you know the answer to that.

It was not an unusual storyline, I have seen hundreds of other similar films, but it was from the different country, hence different language, culture, comedies, landscapes and different outcome result. Well, this film gets you at with the different moods at the different level of the narration. A fine merges of multiple genre, and yet delivers more than you anticipating. If you are wondering what is the meaning of the title, 'Well Done' or 'Bravo' is the English translation.

Low budget movie? But, that's the reason this movie makes a very interesting. Because the 19th century tale and this film that kind feels like made in the early 30s (except the high framerate) pretty unlike to any modern black and white films. Definitely a must see if you're interested in this year's Oscar nominees for the best foreign movies, even though it did not make.

Forky is an interesting character... but gets sidelined about a third of the way into the film. Reintroducing and expanding on the character of Bo Peep was generally handled well, but the rest of the classic toys receive almost no screentime whatsoever. Meanwhile, Buzz does receive the focus he deserves, but feels bizarrely dumbed down, mainly used as comic relief, in stark contrast to prior entries.

For every idea Toy Story 4 does well (see the film's villain: Gabby, and her absolutely terrifying minions), there is another left to the wayside. The film explores new ideas, and new characters, in a new setting, but seems unable or unwilling to utilize most of what came before... 

 and when you have a series as cohesive, imaginative, and beloved as the original Toy Story trilogy, those relatively minor flaws quickly add up into a product that simply feels lesser than what came before. Toy Story 4 is far from a bad film, and succeeds far more than it fails, but it still falls short of the franchise's prior bar by a noticeable margin."

This is a perfect example of its progression. When I think of 3D animation I think of Toy Story. If you look back at the one made in the 90s it looks like a proof of concept submission, this is the standard now. Amazing!

The movie is great but forgets about many of the main characters. This movie is all about Woody and its basically a goodbye from Tom Hanks whos leaving the series. Remember he was there from the start. It took Pixar years to make the first Toy Story and he was part of that long journey. Pixar probably thought Tom deserved a send off of epic proportions and basically made a woody movie for him. It really is emotional to think he leaving a series hes been part of or work on across the last 25 years. But he's leaving on his terms. Who knows maybe he'll drop in.

Im going to give this a ten. It does what it sets out to do and executes it perfectly. This movie has a target and hits its target. Some movies set out to paint a house green and you end up with a teal colour but this movie is going to paint the damn house green. Its great, the colour is great. This is Pixar at its finest."

Forky looked annoying, the jokes weren't landing in the trailers, and it looked like a cash grab.  Boy was I ever wrong.  This movie is fantastic, which is a big relief to say.  Toy Story 3 is a great conclusion, but Toy Story 4 is Woody's conclusion.  This one is the most bittersweet of the Toy Story's for me, but I say that with a smile on my face because this movie is directed beautifully.  Forky is in fact not annoying but very funny.  This movie might be the funniest Toy Story, and there is a really good story to be told here.  The animation looks photorealistic; everything looks absolutely incredible in this movie.  The antagonist of this movie was also really great.  Lottso was great in the third but this one has even more layers which I applaud.  And yes, this movie made me cry.  I did not expect that, but it really happened.  As for flaws, there aren't many but they do stand out a little.  I wish the character of Buzz had more to do or at least wasn't ""dumbed down"" as many people have said.  The dialogue isn't perfect and some of the talking scenes feel a bit awkward.  Overall, this movie surprised the heck out of me.  It's the best PIXAR sequel since Toy Story 3, which I still consider to be better.  Toy Story 3 is one of those perfect movies for me, but Toy Story 4 is absolutely amazing and surprising.  I am so happy to say that."

Toy Story 4 isn't Pixar at its best but I still think it's pretty good. It ended up having a purpose to the franchise and giving it a (hopefully) definitive closure this time. I know that this movie has divided fans, specially the way it ended, but personally I still think that it felt like a movie with love and effort put into it and not just a cashgrab, despite now not being as good as I thought it was the first time I watched it.

It still feels like a Toy Story movie: It has a well written story with mature underlying themes that were presented in an excellent way. It does feel like a movie that explores the themes of finding a purpose in life and running away from toxic environments if we can't do anything to improve them. I personally think that the way the story was executed is still better than Toy Story 3 because that one had ridiculous plot conveniences and really bad jokes, despite the ending still being a lot more emotional than this one.
The score is just as excellent as in the previous movies. The returning characters and new characters are compelling and fun to watch, despite how annoying Ducky and Bunny can get at times. However, I have mixed feelings about the character development: Most of the returning cast have nothing to do and they barely have any plot relevance, but the characters the movie decides to focus on are well developed. In my previous review I stated that the new characters are memorable and have a good development but now I don't think that, because Duke Kaboom is just Keanu Reeves in a Toy Story movie (while fun to watch, he doesn't really have too much to do) and Ducky and Bunny, like I said, can get pretty unfunny and at times they kill the tone of the movie, but none of the characters are bad or annoying enough to make the movie unwatchable, that includes Bo Peep, who I don't think it was a bad character like many say, she was just fine.

It has a lot of energy, the pacing is fluid and the movie never gets boring, but because the stakes aren't as high as the previous movies, it feels like it lacks a genuine sense of danger or urgency. I mean, it does, but not as much, but I was still invested the whole movie because of the motivations of the main characters. Sure, it feels a lot more smaller scale than the previous movies because it only takes place in a couple of locations, but I think I'm okay with watching a good story set in those few places. Overall, I like this movie, despite now thinking that it isn't as good as the first time I watched it. It's a really good movie, much better than other Pixar sequels/prequels like Finding Dory, Incredibles 2 or Monsters University, but it's obvious that it's an unnecessary (yet not pointless) film.

And while it is good, it didn't deserve the Oscar. Many people say that Klaus should've won and I kinda agree. My favorite movie out of the nominees was I Lost My Body but Klaus was such a groundbreaking film, at least in the visual **** no, let's give it to Pixar despite not deserving it.

9/10, if I happen to lower the score once more, I'll have to do that for Toy Story 3 (which I gave it a 9/10) too, because, like I said, I like this one just a little bit more than that one."

The film's themes of farther-hood and letting go of the past make the film more relevant and heartfelt as intriguing you watch it. Characters such as Woody and Bo Peep have never been better and new characters like Duke Kaboom and Forky are some of the best side characters the series have ever had. My only flaw with the film is that a vast array of characters really have any time in the spotlight and are pushed aside to make way for other characters and plotlines.

It suffers from the curse of many otherwise good horror movies (such as IT **** ending stinks. Frankly, it does seem tough to find good endings to supernatural stories...once you see the horror before you, it somehow becomes less than the dread building up to it. Good horror movies and bad horror movies often suffer from it. It's a ""short story"" problem. By this, I mean...think about some of the great short stories you've read in your life. Many of them end with abrupt, surprise endings (OCCURRENCE ON OWL CREEK BRIDGE) or perhaps just sort of end (50% of modern day short stories). So you've invested 20 minutes of your time in a just so-so story. Or maybe the surprise ending is abrupt, but it's fun given how little of your time you've given up. You enjoyed the prose, and then the ending wasn't too **** overall, you're content with the time you spent. NOW, turn that ****'ve spend $20+ dollars for the pair of movie tickets. Maybe you bought snacks. You sat in the dark for 90+ minutes. And for 88 minutes, you were having a pretty good time, then suddenly the movie ends. BLAIR WITCH, THE LAST EXORCISM, etc. etc. NOW you feel cheated and disappointed. And for me, THE WITCH fell into this trap, and for that it should get a 2 star rating, perhaps.

But, the building of atmosphere and dread is top notch. Some truly creepy and disturbing things happen. The movie is set in puritanical times, and follows a family that is SO puritanical, that they've been kicked out of town!! Dad is the fanatic, and of course his wife and children follow along. They build a house and homestead near a forest, and almost immediately, weird stuff starts to happen. I won't describe it all, but much involves animals and VERY creepy younger siblings. The story is told mostly through the eyes of the oldest daughter, a girl on the edge of ""womanhood"" (to use a somewhat icky cliche). I put it this way, because her own father mistrusts his daughter when he sees she's growing up. He believes we are all sinful, and women especially are not to be trusted. So when bad things start happening, who does he blame first? Anyway, the atmosphere is awesomely done, and the acting is really top notch. These are fairly inexperienced performers, but they do very, very well. And when all hell finally starts to break loose, you feel pretty bad for some of the things that start happening to these **** alien and extreme as they may seem.

And really, the entire setting and time of the film is well done. I felt that the details of everyday life, the set and costume design, etc. was all really excellent. Low budget, but never cheap. Cinematography was good. The minimal special effects were good. Only the sound mix seemed **** I can't say if that was the theater's fault or the film. But sometimes I had a hard time understanding everyone. But I really appreciated the feeling of immersion, not just in a creepy atmosphere but into a world that felt real yet unfamiliar. This was an extra touch that really made me respond to the film. I give it four stars, but would hesitate to recommend to anyone. It's slow moving (VERY) and it disappoints with its ending. For me, the other parts of the film overcame all that. But I can EASILY see that this would not be the case for other viewers. I will probably watch it again after the blu-ray is **** I bet I'll watch it alone."

The movie never turns its back on raw and unedited violence and never seems too dull to watch. I swear to god, in like the middle of the movie, I got a very big need to sneeze but I was just so glued to the screen that I was holding it in for at least 3 minutes. Visually, the movie is a masterclass. Sure, it's not very colorful but that was kind of the intention, the shots are beautifully made, with a wider shot when necessary but mostly up close and personal and the screenplay of a family going mad and getting corrupted by this evil force from the woods is just gripping right to the end. If you are expecting a horror movie like the Insidious or the Conjuring, I have to disappoint you, this is not going to be the movie for you. If you like dark and depressing movies tough, then you will enjoy every frame of this masterpiece.

The Witch é um filme atmosférico, com uma excelente direção de arte, fotografia e figurino. A mixagem de sim funciona bem nos momentos de tensão, sabendo como aumentar os sons gradativamente até o ápice. Os sons binaurais também funcionam bem.

O elenco entrega o que é necessário. É difícil destacar, visto que toda família está bem, mas meus favoritos foram Anya Taylor-Joy e Ralph Ineson.

A tensão é construída desde a primeira cena. A caracterização da família e da floresta ajuda muito a causar uma sensação incomoda. E falando em caracterização, o trabalho da produção como um todo está excelente, visto que o conceito de bruxa foi muito bem explorado aqui, mas de uma forma introvertida. Basicamente, eles trabalham em ditados e lendas populares, o que não é uma tarefa fácil. As cenas mais pesadas da obra funcionaram bastante comigo, exceto o final. Acredito que o filme queria me passar uma sensação mais impactante, mas ainda assim não foi o suficiente. Talvez o longa exigisse que houvesse uma fobia para que o final funcionasse mais como algo ""impactante"".

Eggers captured a puritan family from 1630s New England with the use of natural lighting and candlelight coupled with archaic vocabulary. I’m really glad they opted for natural light and dull-colored clothing which added to the eeriness of the woods. The acting was also phenomenal (the scene of Anya Taylor-Joy and Ralph Ineson was just beautiful) and the score just leads you through the frightening shots. It just really felt authentic and I believe that is what Eggers was trying to achieve for this film, authenticity despite the folkloric idea of a witch.

I loved how Eggers builds up the looming chaos that is about to happen within the family. When the chaos ensued, that is when the horror sets in. The isolation, together with the witch’s endeavor, drove the family to be rattled and deranged. Unfortunately, the very faith which they hold on for safety has blinded them and led them to act beyond reason, even beyond family. 

A great film that dissects the horrors of isolation and piousness."

This is the second, and (spoilers) not the last film on the list from A24, certainly a testament to the quality of their films, although not everything they have a hand in turns out great. Throughout The Witch and later in The Lighthouse Eggers establishes his unrivalled talent at building atmosphere. For this film, Eggers manages to use less to create more: the sparse dialogue, the sporadic yet well-crafted small set pieces, and the colour grading all come together to create a believably Puritanical world within the film. When it comes to acting, the children and adults all provide believable performances but my favourite, and I am biased in this regard, is that of Anya Taylor-Joy. Her performance and how it changes throughout her character arc helped sell the movie’s atmosphere. The Witch succeeds where many other films have failed, The Witch presents its audience with the occult, a historically murky world, and manages to create a work that explores not only the stigmas of the past but also of today."

Fortunately, a streaming service played the trailer for me after I finished another movie, and at a mere 92 minute runtime, I gave it a shot. This film hits it home as a good-ol'-fashioned scary movie, with clear artistic vision and a refreshing creative integrity. I love the bleak, underused setting of colonial New England, and the King James-y dialogue is surprisingly tolerable. The Witch, like many good horror movies, plays to our collective human fears and embellishes them with all the right supernatural spooks. The filial bickering, claustrophobia, and impending dread drag the viewer along by her ear to the chilling and abrupt end. One of the main strengths of this movie is that nothing gets overdone, yet this leads me to my one missing star-I wanted to see just a bit more! This film pays homage to the time-tested aspects of good horror, doesn't rely on visuals, and still delivers a fresh story. Two Puritan thumbs up!"

The VVithch: A New-England Folktale

Eggers respects the rituals and in return the rituals him. By the time you are done with the film, you ought to have some faith in these folks. The writer and director Robert Eggers having confessed that it is adapted after going through tons of tales and rumors and history of such themes, he has narrowed it down to a gripping family drama. Yes, a family drama. It may resemble with Nicholas Hytner's The Crucible, but before that it is about a family trying to get over from the past and heal themselves from the wounds rather than reminisce about it.

But when something so powerful and unknown casts his or her eye on the weak, there is very little time to fight back. And the family struggling with the outer threat, Eggers takes us through all the perspective, decisions and attempts they pull off to survive in this mayhem. That very middle act, is the best part of the film. You feel claustrophobic as the loved ones turns against each other and enraged when your host is put on trial.

Pointing fingers at each other, blaming at each other, we, as an audience, are also kept under the curtains, which not only teases our brains but our emotions too as we wish it to not go the way, that we have always feared, up till then. And Anya Taylor Joy at the centre of this family crisis, is giving her best as the character and actor, embracing the evil side of her and succumbing to the softer absorbing aspect, she spices up this formula, a long before it grasps a proper pace. The VVitch: A New England Folktale is English, is new, is Witch-y, is horrifying, promising and spectacularly painted with gore visuals that are definitely not for weak hearts."

The Witch has been lambasted by audiences for its sluggish pace and lack of pulse-pounding scares, but these people just don’t understand that it’s not supposed to be a straight-up startle-fest horror movie. The Witch is a slow-burning, eerily disturbing period-piece psychological thriller, and it’s brilliant. It really got under my skin.

This is Robert Eggers’ directorial debut and his screenplay and direction style are beyond impressive. The dialogue is true to the 17th century setting and it builds a very convincing family dynamic between the characters that makes the tragedy that unfolds throughout the story so much more heartbreaking and distressing. The musical score is phenomenal, providing music only when necessary and it always comes in at just the right moments to add weight to the story’s darkest moments.

The way the film is shot is mostly spectacular, with each frame boasting vibrant colours and smooth camerawork that sets up the proper tone and tension of the scene being captured. However, there are some scenes in which a conflict happens where the editing makes it difficult to know what’s going on, and that took me out of what should have been the most intense parts of the story.

The story is one that’s ambiguous and thought-provoking. There are many questions that are left completely unanswered at the end of the film, and that’s how it’s supposed to be. If that bothers you, this movie isn’t for you. Some of the loose ends bothered me, others didn’t. But regardless, the uncertainty is what makes The Witch so unsettling. I’m glad that Eggers trusts his audience enough to let them figure the story out on their own. The Witch is an ambitious film, and it packs a lot into its 90 minutes. It’s an intelligent commentary on hopelessness and family while also being a very creepy supernatural thriller, and it’s one that still has a hold on my mind.

1187,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-witch/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Wolfstarking,"Jan 29, 2018",9,"The state of horror films today is a tricky one, horror is such an unstable genre due to the fact that the industry hasn't treated it with respect for quite a while. This doesn't mean there are no great horror films coming out today in fact there are but not as many as every fan would want to be or not as many as we need. Last year David Robert Mitchell's film ""It Follows"" was the most interesting and the most well accomplished horror film of the year due to how the director was able to treat the genre with respect and tell a story with such a tense atmosphere although not quite the masterpiece people made it out to be it was a breath of fresh air. This year after winning last year's Sundance award for best director newcomer Robert Eggers brings us quite possibly the horror film of the year ""The Witch"" (A New England Folk Take) and it brings new and interesting things to the table and it will also be quite divisive.
""The Witch"" set on the 17th century centers around a 1630s Massachusetts family who are cast out from the rest of their Puritan community and forced to fend for themselves. When a supernatural force, emanating from the nearby woods, brings tragedy, the family starts to look at their oldest daughter (Anya Taylor-Joy) with suspicion, delusion and fear later starts to break loose.

This is not a typical and generic horror film in fact there's much much more to it than it might seem on the surface. Puritanism is a subject that I've personally been interested for a quite some time and this is exactly the theme that surrounds the whole film. It's interesting to watch the past of our own countries and civilizations and see how their traditions, morals and fear of the unknown still surrounds us to this day and age and it doesn't let go. It's interesting to see how the theme of witchcraft is displayed and represented in here because instead of being a subject to cheaply scare us it rather invites us to be more critical about it, to observe it and to analyze it specially how the prejudice towards women and the suspicion of witchcraft was always involved around women in the era; Eggers draws a parallelism between 17th century era and modern era about the treatment and misjudgment of women around a patriarchal society and puritanism.

Eggers treats the supernaturally rather seriously and embraces it as a reality that can be viewed around us due to how it portrays the huge role of religion which still heavily exists in our society, the fear of god, demons and witchcraft. This is a huge reality in the minds of these people and despite everything being real or just a delusion it is a very tangible presence around them and it is an unconscious presence still today.
The most impressive thing about ""The Witch"" is Robert Eggers incredible direction it's very evident how well researched everything was starting by the well realized setting and the english language which feels Shakespearean at times to the incredible performances which by the way are some of the best children performances I've ever seen on the screen.
""The Witch"" is a well done film and it is one I very much appreciate due to how puts out something different in the horror genre something real and something that definitely speaks about something rather than just being an cheap cheesy jump scare fest and this is the part in which I'm sure many audience members will have a problem with because it's quite honestly not that. The film goes to a very slow moving first act to an inducing second act to an excellent final third act with an ending which I really appreciated. Robert Eggers is a director I will gladly follow and I'm very excited to see what he does next. ""The Witch"" is not just a good horror film, it's a great film."

1194,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/graduation/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"May 16, 2017",7,"A father's desperate attempt for his daughter.

From the director of 'Beyond the Hills'. I have not seen many Romanian films, but a couple of his films, so I had an anticipation and it fulfilled that. If you are familiar with his works, you will love it too as well. It is an Oscar material like 'Toni Erdmann', but Romania had sent a different film. The film had achieved multiple things, including majorly highlighting the social issues and the education system, particularly from the parent's perspective. But it is basically about a father and his desperate attempts for his daughter for her better future. So it is something like 'Fathers & Daughter', but on one particular topic and the on- screen presentation was so realistic without the background score.

Everything revolved around what the title suggested. A father who is professionally a doctor wants to provide a better education for his daughter. While facing a series of vandalism, his family gets a major shock after an unexpected terrible event. It was just before the daughter's annual exam. So it seems they're all disturbed by it, but the father is still not giving up on his daughter's exam, which requires a better score to get into the best university in the world. Apart from that, his other side of the personal and professional life takes some major turns. The film reveals all his struggles while breaking some moral laws.

❝Sometimes, in life, it's the result that counts.❞

The tale was told from the father's perspective and that character was seen almost in every frame. A good father knows what's best for his child, but sometimes crossing limits is what they do because of love and care. On the other hand, growing up kids, especially turning eighteen means that's when they actually begin to meet the real world. So basically they want to lose their parents' influence in their life as much as possible like when a baby bird starting to stretch its wings. Those stuffs were not prioritised here, but understandable from the developments we witness.

From the social aspect, the corruption and educational demands, that's especially in the high scoring contest were the deriving plots from the main. The film could have been 10-15 minutes shorter if the father's professional side of the tale was not covered. It looked unnecessary, but fairly the part of the story when a slice of his life was what this film is about. I think not everybody sees the film's intention which is definitely not entertainment, nor inspiration, but kind of fact based on the parents.

Yeah, I would have done almost the same as what the father has done in this. But due to some parallel developments in the main story, he had to face extra pressure from his own family. So unexpected way the narration takes the turn towards the final section. That's disappointing if you had supported the father from the very beginning. But a lesson he had learnt for his approach to deal the affair that he thought is slipping away from his master plan.

Overall, a very good film, something you will learn how some people plan to deal a difficult stage of their life that's impacted by other surrounding developments. My only, slight disappointment was the crime part of the story which did not meet my expectation, but in most of the case that's how reality would be. So this is for particularly the drama film fans, because coping with the pace requires a little patience.

It is a drama about many things but more than anything it is about choices that parents make for their children. Parents have more life experience that their children. But does that necessarily mean their long-term decisions for their grown-up kids are correct?

This movie is as different from Hollywood production as possible. People speak soft, even in dramatic situations. Their emotions are subdued, and that makes it even more real.

Excellent performances and casting. The film looks very authentic and truthful.

In short, it is one of the best foreign movies I've seen this year."

Charming and hypnotic, Kubo possesses a real sense of inner warmth, the kind that's often missing from shallower family films. I think the precise, breathtaking stop-motion animation is to thank for a lot of that. Clearly, a lot of care and painstaking effort went into the way the characters, landscapes and magical effects live, breathe and radiate. As a sheer visual showpiece, this is delightful; fresh and well-designed, loaded with winks and secrets and unexplored mystery. I could dwell here for ages and never run out of inspiration.

The plot stumbles a bit, though, struggling to marry the journey's challenge with its destination, and only seems to scratch the surface of its larger potential. Charlize Theron is excellent as the film's motherly voice of reason, stern yet caring, but Matthew McConaughey was a mismatched choice as her bold-yet-brainless counterpart, the armor-clad insectine warrior.

An excellent display of unbound creativity, which finally delivers a material counterpoint to the flood of CG kids' movies on the market today, I was deeply impressed by the looks and mildly underwhelmed by the story."

However, the film really hurts itself by relying too much on CGI. What is actual stop motion and real versus what isn't? I didn't know. Whereas with Coraline, almost every part of the film was something handcrafted. Why go to all of the work for stop motion when you are going to add in digital effects and make the viewer forget that each scene was handmade?

Kubo And The Two Strings

Knight's animated and magical world is adorable yet powerfully enchanting self inspired journey that is spellbounding for its originality and simplicity. Already been told a familiar concept as such, this savior of ours wins over the family drama than the general political views. Frankly, it is a personal tale conveyed with nightmarish demonic path and powerful undefeated- in fact- swords and magic. As much as mythologically the tale thrives upon, it also doesn't overstays its welcome by dwelling utterly on the past. It keeps refreshing the equation through creating the new equations on screen that leaves a long lasting impression.

Another major contributing factor is humbleness that each of its three dimensional characters works on. Donating their last drop of sweat and blood for the greater good, each supporting character pushes the protagonist up till the hill. It runs on a linear and simpler track that every now and then is funny and action packed, which leaves you in an awe for its layered through provoking concept. Voice cast has managed to stick by their role convincingly. Theron as the overprotective mother or arguably the only guardian, is walking on new terms but is still a soothing compelling performer.

Challenging her parallel-y lies McConaughey's completely opposite light hearted gullible brave warrior that keeps the bed warm and cozy. Fiennes as the ultimate climatic thrill may not have much to do but Mara as evil twins gets healthy amount of time to make it goofy with a still rigid mask. Parkinson, the protagonist, the one, is a fast learner and has the perfect amount of uncertainty in his voice to ignite the curiosity. Kubo And The Two Strings is Knight at his finest, from smoothness in sailing to exploring dark magic, his world is as always human to look at."

The marketing alone showcases most of what is so great about this film; the soundtrack, the voice acting and the animation is all done to perfection. If you can enjoy a movie for its visual presentation alone, this can possibly be considered one of the most enjoyable films ever made. Where the film falls short for me is in the overall storyboarding, the themes it tries to tell and the exposition. The movie establishes early on that the use of origami and Kubo's magical guitar can be used to tell stories and yet we only see this being used effectively once. Other times we have odd and moment-breaking exposition during action sequences, that could have been used so much better in earlier scenes involving Kubo's magic. The twists and turns of this movie also appears out of nowhere with no hinting or foundation for such twists earlier in the movie. The story sort of follows the typical quirky adventure beat, without being smart about laying the foundation for the bits in the second and third act that could have had a much stronger impact. It's a shame, because the story and themes of this movie are well-intended, if not a bit rough in the finished product. All in all Kubo and the two strings is a good watch, that effectively relies on its animation and visual storytelling. The logic and structure of the story is excused by the adventure which is presented, possibly making the movie a spectacular watch for someone less critical than myself."

A good poem uses the fewest words necessary to achieve the desired result, packing meaning into every phrase.  This movie packs meaning into every scene, every line and every visual.  I almost never buy movies because I won't re-watch them, but as soon as I finished Kubo I wanted to restart it, to catch details I'd missed and to see how knowing more about the characters and story would shade my understanding.
""If you must blink, do it now.""  Because once the movie starts, you won't want to."

Kubo and the two strings went completely under my radar for films to watch. So finally I gave it watch on Netflix.

Just from the very few first minutes my eyes were greeted with masterful crafted stop motion. Kubo and the two strings sense of Art direction is something I have ever seen before.

Kubo and the two Strings kept my attention throughout the whole film. Never in a moment where I felt this film hit a low point. Every scene either has well choreographed action set pieces or meaningful scenes between our characters. Also how this film paces through its editing style keeps every next cut interesting

I never thought I would get such a serious theme from a film like this. I feel it was handles very well as it was being told through the film. Basically I saw two themes here. The major one was that memories are the most powerful thing you could ever have and every story has a end. These two kind of entangle with each other as in the end of the film Kubo honors his parents as passing memory at the ending scene of this film, thus giving Kubo a end to his story

However, for the plot of the film I feel it was a little bit of a mashed up adventure with your typical encounters with baddies and with the epic final boss at the end. But for the most part it checks off everything on creating a compelling characters and conflicts.

Kubo and the Two Strings is defiantly worth the watch and I encourage all of you to take a night with some popcorn and watch it."

The story, as always, show us a kid as protagonist, who is gifted and will have to face supernatural forces in order to prove him/herself the inherent value of his/her uniqueness. Here, the storyline is a quest for solving a family conflict, enriched with moments of self-discovery, acknowledging family relationships and learning the importance of memoirs and ancestors. With captivating plot-twists the dynamism is maintained and the protagonist’s process never becomes too dense or tedious. The problematic is without questioning, at the ending, when everything falls in the trap of an animated picture, resolving the conflict childishly and very quickly in order to get everyone happy. When comparing with the outcome in ParaNorman, where forces of good and evil preferred to talk and good showed evil how things actually were with the objective to teach instead of defeat; Kubo did nothing of that, although it could have. Besides that, the most outstanding achievement of this film is the stop motion and visual effects, where body movements and facial expressions are just basics; the natural flow of hair, fur, clothes and origami figures made it a work of art; and the job with the antagonist put this movie in a museum."

1225,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/kubo-and-the-two-strings/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Spangle,"Feb 5, 2017",7,"Compared to other Oscar-nominated animated films I have seen (Zootopia and Moana), Kubo and the Two Strings is far superior when it comes to visual effects. It is no surprise that the film has received accolades for this, as the film's animations and little visual effect tricks are impeccable. As Kubo tells his stories and the papers begin to replicate characters, the visual impact is impeccable and a true testament to the hard work put in by the animators. The cinematography is also breathtaking with the film using the sun and the trees to create a very natural beauty for a film that occurs in such mystical terms. That said, it is not as funny or as adventurous as its animated counterparts and it is this missing element that leaves Kubo and the Two Strings as a good film, but not one that is very good or great.

With terrific voice acting from Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron, Matthew McConaughey, Ralph Fiennes, and Rooney Mara, the film sets up a conflict between the Moon King (Fiennes) and Kubo (Parkinson). Kubo, a young boy with magical powers from his mother, is the grandson of the Moon King. However, the Moon King is blind to the world and its pain and desires. He is cold and unwelcoming and wants Kubo to be the same way, so he takes one of his eyes. He tries to take the other, but his mother and father take him away. However, his father is killed, leaving him alone with his magical mother, Sariatu (Theron). Accompanied by his mother as a monkey (it makes sense) and Beetle (Matthew McConaughey), Kubo embarks on a journey to find his father's armor in order to defeat the Moon King. What ensues is a film with great mythology, but is far too predictable. It is a kids movie, yes, but I do not mean the plot. The various little twists are ear marked from the beginning and, yet, the film treats them as if they are incredible and totally unforeseen. This is a shame because the film could have moved through some of these elements quicker and not just relied upon them for surprises.

That said, the film's mythology and use of magic is incredible. Not only is it beautifully animated in this regard, but it always instills a sense of awe and incredible power that, for young kids, will make them want to run out and pretend to be Kubo. This is a terrific trait for an animated film aimed at kids and it is one this film has in bunches. It is an incredibly imaginative film that also serves as an introduction to Asian culture and beliefs regarding death and the connection between man and nature. Again, these sequences are brilliantly brought to life, but have even more power in the meaning of these moments and the weight with which it is communicated. This is a film with a deep respect for Asian culture and it shows.

Comedically, the film is strongest when Beetle is on the screen. All animated movies must infuse comedy to keep kids engaged and this one is no exception. McConaughey delivers the comedic lines brilliantly and the film drags a bit when he is off the screen. Beetle really gives the film the comedic energy and urgency it desperately needs. On that note, the film can somewhat slack off at times, losing the sense of adventure and pace demanded by its target audience. The film may miss the mark in entertaining children for this reason as the film's comedic introductions are not frequent enough and its story can take a bit too long to reveal itself.

More problematically, it is interesting to see this film be let off the hook for its casting. Sure, pile on The Great Wall where Matt Damon plays a white character from Europe that just happens to be in China, but let this one off the hook. All of these characters are voiced by white actors and all of the characters are Asian. This is not something I would detract from the film rating-wise, but how this one escaped controversy is very odd. There are enough good, talented Asian actors that could have fulfilled these roles, so it is a shame to see the film rely on talented, but white actors instead. Shocking that those who are more cognizant of these issues did not raise these concerns regarding these film.

That said, the film is impeccably animated with phenomenal visual effects. Its embracing of its mythology and Asian culture is incredible and often quite powerful to watch unfold. That said, its plot ""twists"" are too obvious and the film can drag in parts, while never utilizing its strong supporting cast enough in comparison to the quality they bring to this film. Overall, it is a good film, but lacks that extra bit to make it a great one."
1226,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/kubo-and-the-two-strings/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,danigarvire,"Jan 24, 2017",9,"Originalidad es un adjetivo que el estudio Laika se ha ganado a pulso en los últimos años con títulos como la extraña y horripilante “Coraline” o la creativa “Boxtrolls”. Sin duda este estudio, que algunos pronostican que será el próximo Studio Ghibli, acaba de superarse con la épica historia de Kubo y las dos cuerdas mágicas.

A Kubo le encanta narrar relatos y se le da realmente bien, pero siempre tiene problemas a la hora de cerrar sus historias con un buen final. De algún modo esta premisa servirá de alegoría a lo largo de un viaje de madurez en el que su vida y la de sus seres queridos se ve puesta en grave peligro. La aventura de Kubo es un relato que sabe mantener un tono sorprendentemente apropiado para edades muy dispares. Como niño sin duda es una aventura trepidante aunque con momentos realmente duros que el guión sabe suavizar con maestría para los más pequeños. A pesar de ello da en el clavo para aquellos con la madurez suficiente para ver lo que hay detrás. Es una película excelente para todas las edades.

Kubo es una película que esta atada a la música casi de un modo sinestético y ésta está acompañada de la mejor animación de todo el año y el mejor “stop motion” de los últimos años (sin duda la principal arma del estudio Laika). El doblaje de voz por parte de Charlize Theron como el Mono y Mathew McConaughey como el escarabajo es inmejorable y saben dar vida a dos personajes que acompañan al protagonista en su viaje y se sienten totalmente vivos en pantalla.

Hay frames de la película que podrían ser perfectamente un cuadro y tanto la historia como las imágenes que se encargan de contarla dejan boquiabiertos con cada giro del guión y cada nuevo descubrimiento. Trata además temas sorprendentemente maduros que no se ven con tanta frecuencia y recuerdan de un curioso modo al clásico “The iron Giant” y a la aclamada nueva película de J.A Bayona “A Monster Calls”. He de decir que Kubo y las dos cuerdas mágicas es seguramente la mejor adaptación al cine de Zelda que nunca tendremos. No toma elementos del clásico juego pero el ambiente de descubrimiento y aventura que plasma es sin duda muy similar.

En definitiva Kubo y las dos cuerdas mágicas es un soplo de aire fresco y devuelve la esperanza que algunos veían perdida con el cierre del estudio Ghibli. Laika sigue así y no nos falles me acabas de regalar mi película favorita de 2016."

After watching Kubo, I sat stunned through the credits and spent two days analyzing every last detail of the picture. It was delicate, sublime, sad, triumphant, exciting.... put in another 200 adjectives and that should cover it. It was also mind blowing to realize how much exacting work went into a stop-motion movie with quite a lot of action. I could watch this again forever. That's my favorite type of movie."

It's an emotional and adult story that's told in a way that's acceptable for all audiences. It's brimming with depth, humor, and emotion. There's also some impressive action and magic.

1231,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/kubo-and-the-two-strings/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TrevorsView,"Dec 13, 2016",7,"Travis Knight takes the director’s chair under the same studio that created other stop-motion spectacles such as Coraline, ParaNorman, and The Boxtrolls. Except this one stands out far greater than the others, as Kubo and the Two Strings uses a classical story to make a tribute to the art of storytelling, in the form of Japanese clay puppets and the old forgotten art of origami.

Never before has a story about a one-eyed lonely boy feeding his spiritually lost mother felt so captivating for a contemporary audience. This little restless wanderer takes his journey toward self-worth to a much greater level, as he treats us to a story told within a story with his origami figures, the strings of these puppets controlled by the strings of his musical instrument. Just one sound of the strum, and the paper folds itself to tell of a Moon King who takes a samurai and his family. But young Kubo is not satisfied with his life, as he longs to find his lost father, who he’s been told was once a mighty warrior.

All other strides taken by the animators to generate this moving picture are worth the attention of all worldwide art academies. These artists know how to fluidly combine the techniques of stop-motion animation and computer generated imagery in a way that services the artistry rather than the technicality. I am now officially won over upon the concept of combining CGI with Claymation, as everything in the frame of this feature flows and blends together seamlessly, making it impossible to tell what is CGI and what is practical. Kubo is a remarkable feat for 3D viewing.

The moments of spectacle in the near-two-hour run time include a moonlit ocean wave split in half, a big scary skeleton with glowing eyes, a large underwater sea creature with a circular mouth, a swordfight with a monster from the afterlife, and two frightening looking ladies who appear merged from V for Vendetta and the twins from The Shining.
​
With such a love toward the history of storytelling, it’s a shame that the story itself needed some fine tuning here and there, particularly in the second act.

After some serious drama, Kubo winds up in some other world coated in snow, a monkey there to greet him. Here is where Kubo begins to feel tonally different from how it was marketed.

The next hour contains an excess of humor that for the most part falls flat. The conflict is there between the boy and the authoritative monkey, but by jokes that suggest a genre not previously established. To make it worse, Kubo and the monkey later meet with a beetle who has no memory of his past life. Almost all of his dialogue contains jokes that would get on anybody’s nerves like the class clown you had in fourth grade. The voices of these two mentors to the boy are voiced by Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey, neither of which are that terribly fitting with their parts. But Theron does actually have her moment as she gets to tell a story to Kubo in the classical warm tone as told through memory. I’d also like to add that there is a plot twist involving these two figures, but it’s one of those twists you could have easily guessed.

This film’s theme supports the belief of Buddhism, which includes reincarnation and praying to ancestors. If you, like me, are of a Christian or other religious belief, it might be offensive to you. But on the plus side, strong bonds in the feature are made between mother and son, offering children an important moral on the importance of storytelling from generation to generation.

I always enjoy a good stop-motion film now and then; it’s such a shame there isn’t nearly enough of them being made nowadays. I think innovative forms of animation such as this one add significantly more meaning and artistry to storytelling, much more impactful than the computer animation we’ve gotten way too used to. Now look, I still enjoy CGI as much as the next guy, but I also enjoy a little variety.

This story about stories reveals to us why we go to movies: the stories told reveal our true selves, including which ones appeal to us and which ones we choose to tell. Stories, especially in movie format, live on past our own lives through constant retellings."

This is not an old fashioned stop-motion animation. This is a very modern, a hybrid of multiple techniques that includes 3D printing and digital special effects. The directional debut for the producer of 'ParaNorman' and 'The Boxtrolls'. The tale is about a one eyed boy named Kubo, who has been hiding in a seaside mountain cave near a small village from his grandfather, the moon king, ever since his birth, protected by his mother. He grew up listening the stories of a legendary samurai warrior Hanzo. But one day after he himself exposed to the moonlight, the troubles follow. Now his only chance to survive is to find his father's armours and so the quest begins where he teams up with other two.

This is a Japanese story, takes place somewhere in a fictional ancient Japan. Technically, this film was so good, very pleasant for viewing, especially the framerate was higher than normal stop-motion animation. The character models, music, the length of the film, the pace of the narration, all were so brilliant, but not the story. It was average, I mean very, very simple and familiar. Still, it is a very likable film, particularly the children would love it. I'm going to repeat again like I always say while reviewing stop-motion animation films that this kind of films are rare, so when they make one, that automatically goes to a must see list. Whether you're going to like it or not, I hope you won't miss it.

I was kind of leaning towards a 7 but in the last 30-40 minutes of the film, It was like flicking a switch. The emotional journey that Kubo takes hits the high it's been building towards and by the climax, You can't help but feel for him, all he's lost and the closer he's gained by finishing his unexpected quest.

And what really helps carry this film isn't just the talented voice acting cast but by the voice of Kubo - Art Parkinson. Not only does he have to compete against some of the best talent alive but at just 15, He totally delivers and gives a great performance. Kubo is my pick for best animated film of the year."

After all, what other movie have you seen that stars a magical boy, a monkey and a beetle samurai? The odds that you have come across this concept before is pretty unlikely.

The movie is basically about a powerful young boy named Kubo (Art Parkinson) who embarks on a journey with his guardian, a.k.a. Monkey (Charlize Theron) and an amnesiac samurai-beetle (Matthew McConaughey) to find magic armour when his grandfather, the Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) comes after him to convert him to the ‘dark side’, so to speak. And if that wasn’t already enough of an all-star cast, Rooney Mara voices Kubo’s two aunts, who are powerful and scary witches, both of who are excellently animated and acted.

A strong link in this movie is the beautiful animation, which blends origami and stop-motion animation, which works surprisingly well. Some out-of-place CGI sticks out like a sore thumb, but luckily it is scarcely used.

Kubo and the Two Strings is easily Laika’s best movie to date, with stunning animation, excellent voiceover work and one of the most original stories in recent memory."

Set in a small town in 1950’s America, Patterson’s film pays homage to classic science-fiction yarns of old like The Day the Earth Stood Still and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or tapping into Tv shows like The X-Files and (far more obviously in its opening shot) The Twilight Zone. The paranoia of this time in the U.S is evoked wonderfully and Patterson manages to do so with a meagre budget and two brilliant central performances from newcomers Jake Horowitz and Sierra McCormick. From the opening scene, it grips and only expertly builds on that momentum with some inventive directorial touches; dialogue heavy scenes are lingered on, while sweeping tracking shots give a grander overview of the small town and there’s even fade to black moments that capture the wonder (or the dangers) of the night sky surrounding the characters. This is hugely impressive filmmaking from a newcomer that plays out like a live action version of the now infamous and ill-fated Orson Welles radio broadcast of War of the Worlds that caused panic among its listeners. Patterson keeps things very simple and doesn’t rely on special effects, instead showing a confidence in his material and as much as this may irk some viewers just remember... sometimes less is more."

Uma das coisas que mais me chamaram atenção foram os diálogos. Eles, por si só, já são o suficiente para te prender na tela até o final do longa. Eles são tão bem estruturados que causam um efeito parecido com a leitura de um livro, onde imaginamos a cena através de um conto - o que é MAGNÍFICO. A OST acrescenta muito, e a cinematografia é autoral demais. Os planos, o trackshot audacioso que nos dá a sensação de simultaneidade [ela é importante devido o contexto], a paleta de cores que ficou peculiar com a luz natural e o ISO alto nas gravações. Tudo isso acrescenta muito e ajudam a criar uma atmosfera única.

A tensão vem crescendo de acordo com que o suspense é gerado. Desde o início do filme nos perguntamos: ""o que estamos vendo?"" e quando as peças começam a encaixar, o clímax vai a mil. Também gosto quando o diretor brinca com nossas expectativas, como quando a carta é ignorada. Ou quando puxa um tema, mas o isola, pois não faz mais parte do presente.

Por fim, The Vast of Night é uma obra de orçamento baixo, porém com uma direção autoral que trabalha muito bem com a reimaginação de um tema muito conhecido. E não nos deixa na mão."

Well, how about a good sci-fi mystery? The Vast of Night directed by Andrew Patterson may satisfy that craving. It premiered on Amazon Prime a couple weeks ago, and I caught up to this film on a night I wanted to be creeped out. Here’s how it turned out.

The Vast of Night is framed as an episode of a “Twilight Zone” inspired show, which immediately puts the audience in the mindset to expect the unexpected. Here, on one fateful night in a small New Mexico town in the 1950s, a local DJ, Everett, and a wide-eyed telephone operator, Faye, stumble upon a strange sound that portends mysteriousness for their town while the majority of the townspeople are at a local basketball game. Everett and Faye try to figure out what it all means and all as a sense of dread lurks around them.

The success of The Vast of Night all hinges on the harnessed ominous tone and the undercurrent of unease portrayed by the actors. Patterson does a great job of establishing dread. The camera lurks and leers behind and around Everett and Faye as they move through the town. There is constant movement by the camera and the main characters in the first third of the movie until it settles down. The world is built very effectively by the costumes and setting, which transports the audience to that time and instills that creepiness the production is trying to achieve. While the main actors are not well-known, Jake Horowitz and Sierra McCormick, who play Everett and Faye, respectively, have a great chemistry and make the fanciful believable. Horowitz, in particular, has the cadence and confidence needed to portray Everett and conveys the creepiness. Then, the pace is generally pretty good. At less than 90 minutes, the film does not waste a lot of time.

While the movie doesn’t waste much time, my main issue with The Vast of Night is that there are stretches of the dialogue that feel like long, tedious exposition. The film basically stops for 5-10 minutes at a time for side characters to tell a story about what’s about to happen. Even though the information in the dialogue is pertinent, it could have been delivered in more interesting ways – that’s one failure of the script.

Ultimately, The Vast of Night is a good way to spend about 90 minutes. The mood is on point. There is a palpable sense of dread throughout and the characters feed into it. Grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy."

The dialogue was very witty and charming. The look and feel of the movie fit the time period very well, and the performances were strong overall.

1266,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-vast-of-night/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Davrosdaleks1,"Jun 7, 2020",8,"This movie on Amazon Prime is a Twilight Zone homage about two friends (played by Sierra McCormick and Jake Horowitz) in the 50's who discover suspicious airwaves and events hitting their small town. This was an interesting film.

This is one of those movies that is so well visually planned, including a couple inspired moments of cinematography. Vast takes place in real time. Now, this isn't a continuous-shot attempt like 1914, but the film makes use of a lot of tracking shots driving in the immediacy of the events.

For a movie made on a small budget, it looks pretty good. The sets, clothing, and vehicles all evoke the time period.

I also appreciate that although a lot of this involves scenes with a small cast (this takes place at night), the populated scenes look busy. A lot of moderately or low-budget movies these days never seem to have as many extras as they did in the 80's, making them feel less natural. This doesn't have that issue.

The dialogue too flows well. Both the rapport between the two leads and moments of unsettling exposition are so well handled. However, the dialogue can fly pretty fast at points and with most of the characters' heavy southern accents it can be hard to follow sometimes. I definitely missed lines.

Be forewarned that this may be too slow-paced for some people. Also, one may be disappointed in the ending.

I had a good time, but I admit that this may be more of an on-the-fence situation when suggesting to others. The visuals definitely work, but the plot may be more subjective."

At home only his elderly and sick mother awaits him, with whom he has a relationship of great affection and patience. In a desolate New York full of secrets, whose noble profile always remains in the distance, Joe works as a mercenary for those who want to get rid of dangerous enemies but do not have the skill or the courage. His latest assignment is to rescue Nina, the pre-adolescent daughter of a local politician, from a child prostitution ring: an abused and offended creature who mirrors the man's past. Joe appears and disappears, often armed with a hammer, as if he had never been there, slashing and chasing with the same hallucinated intensity the devastating memories, both of his childhood at the mercy of a sadistic father, and of the war crimes committed behind him. the justification of a uniform. Joe's is a universe of lost children raised at the mercy of orcs and often become like them, a world in which man moves like an executioner, trying to patch up his life reduced to a puzzle of sensations and bad memories.

It is visceral and respects its audience in the right moments. The violence is never glorified. In fact, the viewer's imagination does a fair bit here which is fantastic. As an audience member, you participate in the film by filling in the blanks. For instance, you will see a body lying crumpled on the floor following the protagonist's vengeful progression through a certain location. It is up to the viewer to determine how said body was 'taken out'. As for the protagonist, Joe, a hired thug who specializes in freeing victims of child trafficking, you get initial glimpses of his past and slowly, you piece together why he fantasizes of suicide. Again subtle, well-made movie but with so much agony here, you appreciate his character, his journey, his efforts to liberate victims of sex crimes while again, thinking, once on this trip is enough.

A trama, em sua base, é muito simples, e pode até ser confundida com outros filmes de ação genéricos no qual estamos acostumados, mas a nuance aqui é a direção de Lynne Ramsay, o que ela escolhe mostrar e o que ela quer nos dizer com aquilo.

Aqui nossa perspectiva gira em torno do protagonista. A diretora quer nos imergir na sua cabeça, e isso fica explicito nos primeiros minutos do filme, onde não entendemos nada e fica a nossa escolha esperar que o filme nos diga algo ou começarmos a nos questionar sobre o que estamos vendo ali - isso é importantíssimo para ditar qual experiencia terás na obra. Joaquim Phoenix dá de tudo nesse papel. O seu personagem, Joe, não é explosivo, cabendo ao ator passar seus gatilhos de suicídio e confusões mentais através de pequenas nuances. A diretora auxilia muito com seus flashbacks, que são postos em momentos minimamente precisos, mostrando mais sobre sua sua infância, período militar e atuação no FBI.

Uma coisa que sempre deixo claro é que a intenção vale muito. Lynne Ramsay não glamoriza a violência, e nem tem o intuito de nos entreter com isso. Muitas vezes, vemos a consequência dos atos do protagonista e sua reação após tudo aquilo. A cena onde ele entra no apartamento/hotel no qual acontecia a prostituição de menores demonstra muito bem isso. A câmera alternando frequentemente e o modo como a violência aqui é tão letal e crua é fantástico.

A OST do filme acrescenta muito na tensão - tensão essa que muitas vezes é subvertida e tem uma conclusão inesperada. O que mais me deixa impressionado é que nada é feito por puro arranjo. Ele ter cantado com o cara que tinha matado sua mãe é algo que tem uma resposta visto todo o psicológico destruído do protagonista. A fotografia trabalha muito bem com planos detalhe e fechados. Foca muito nas expressões e muitas vezes serve como um retrato frio da violência que ali houve.

O final foi surpreendente e certeiro. Até o fim o filme subverteu minhas expectativas sem que parecesse nada forçado. Como na cena onde ele finalmente se mata - até percebermos que tudo aquilo se passava na sua cabeça. E é claro que tudo isso foi possível também pela atuação minuciosa do Joaquim, que passa uma realidade no olhar, nas suas expressões, no seu movimento, no seu corpo que é de ficar embasbacado."

I watched this movie a year ago and then re-watched after seeing Joker. Phoenix gives a stellar performance in a tale that is dark, possibly too dark for many. The movie works with a positive vibe to working towards and ending that is touching. It made me cry. The acting this in this movie is supported by a story that is well written and centers itself on where it should: the characters. This allows the actors to invest and show us people who feel alive and whom you can connect with and maybe even care for. Phoenix has this remarkable skill to do this, which he also shows with Joker. These aren't easy characters to play. If you can stand unusual characters that might be hard to like or understand, then this is a movie you could try. Personally I would just do because if watching a movie with a story that makes good acting possible. Which in itself is a good reason to watch movies like these."

The slight disadvantage of Ramsay’s selective methods mean that we see only sporadic offerings from her… yet when we do get to feast our eyes on a Lynne Ramsay project we’re not in for disappointment. You Were Never Really Here is the writer-director’s fourth film, a favourite at Cannes at 2017 and starring the exceptional Joaquin Phoenix. Based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, this is some of the finest work we have yet seen from Ramsay; harsh, bruising and raw, You Were Never Really Here is the psychological thriller as it’s meant to be done.
Phoenix plays Joe, a brutal yet efficient gun for hire who specialises in finding and rescuing missing teens. We first meet Joe in the opening shot as he attempts to asphyxiate himself; it’s an uncompromising and harrowing image that sets the path of what is an uncompromising and harrowing film. Joe is ravaged by thoughts of suicide, tormented by memories of childhood abuse and wartime tragedy. He is hired by a Senator whose daughter has been kidnapped by a sex ring; it seems easy work for Joe until everything starts to go awry in a violent tale of mystery and trauma. It is tough to think of any way to adequately respond to this film other than to applaud it. Lynne Ramsay crafts a measured thriller, reeking with tension and thematic richness. It runs at a brief 90 minutes though doesn’t feel rushed; truth is, there’s no trimmings here… every shot is painstakingly rendered, every flickering look and every burst of remarkably contained violence reasoned and impactful. It’s a film of few words and this is absolutely to its credit- we understand so much more about Joe and his fragile mental state in that cruel silence. On the outset, one expects an action thriller, a Taken revenge story, but Ramsay turns all expectations on their head. You Were Never Really Here is a pure character study of a deeply troubled man. It’s a testimony of grief and mental torment and prefers quiet moments of tension over bloody gore. The film rests entirely on Joaquin Phoenix, who like Ramsay is delivering some of the most compelling work of his whole career. Phoenix utterly immerses himself in a character that is tragically believable and bolstered by an understated performance from the Oscar nom. However stupendous Phoenix is, Ramsay is the true maestro here. Her direction in this film is enough to quench any sceptics of her skill, a daring approach that lingers on moments of profundity but equally gives the audience no time to breathe. Though there are moments of alarming violence, this is not the focus of the film; we’re distanced from Joe’s ‘work’ (one certain sequence is viewed through the prism of a security camera) yet the fractured flashes of Joe’s damaged psyche are as real and horrifying as anything. In this brutality however there’s something eerily beautiful about You Were Never Really Here; it’s a film full of gorgeous and shocking visual poetry that takes an unnervingly surreal approach and blurs the field of reality- how much of what we are seeing is real and how much of is actually the tormented dreams of our troubled protagonist? It’s one of many interesting questions that is raised… but pleasingly never answered. The sparse dialogue here means there is a relieving lack of exposition; Ramsay isn’t leading you by the hand but rather allowing you to sink into the world she creates and form your own perspective. It’s a world conjured in an illusionary style by Thomas Townend’s judicious cinematography and elevated with unsettling vigour by a superbly atonal score by Jonny Greenwood.
There’s something remarkable about You Were Never Really Here; lacking in ornamentation, everything on show here has some effect, every seemingly trivial shot meaning something more than it does on the surface. It’s a challenging watch but this is part of what makes this and the rest of Ramsay’s filmography so enthralling. Some will walk away asking deeper questions, others will walk away simply satisfied by an intense thriller. Either way, you’ll appreciate the raw craftsmanship behind it, every aspect perfectly aligned to create an eerie and mesmerising piece of cinema."

1289,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/you-were-never-really-here/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DavidWasHere,"Oct 17, 2018",9,"Movies like You Were Never Really Here only get good once you finish watching it. Which is a weird compliment, but in this case it is a very high compliment with how many layers and interpretations the film has that after you are done watching you think about what you saw and what it all meant. It festers in your subconscious that you can't help but think about it more and more until it finally bursts and you came to a conclusion on what it all meant...until you hear a theory that makes sense that you go mad about if your interpretation is right or if the other person's interpretation is about! That is definitely a high compliment!

Joaquin Phoenix gives a great performance. I won't go as far as to call it his finest work, but he does carry this movie and understands a lot of this character and what the film is getting at. Phoenix is like a chameleon whenever he takes a role. You buy who the character is instead of seeing Joaquin Phoenix, and I bought such an interesting and unique character. Lynne Ramsey also deserves a lot of credit. This is the first movie I seen from her, knowing her from her previous film We Need to Talk About Kevin, one that's been on my watchlist for the longest time. After seeing this movie, I want to watch it. Every shot in this film is crisp and polished, and you get transported in what feels like another world, one that is alien-like but also intense and eerie. There's an atmosphere in this film that is just so off-putting you can't help but be **** in. A large thanks to this goes to Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood working on the movie score (although it doesn't beat his work with PTA), benefiting with the other worldly score composition. All of which benefits from the brain chewing story where you aren't truly sure what is going on. Like mentioned before, there are so many layers and theories to mull over that it just entices you to truly learn more about what exactly is going on, which makes for a great watch that will surely benefit the more you watch it.

There are a few issues I did take with this film. For one, the first act is pretty sluggish. It takes a while until the movie really gets going, but the first act of the film feels more like a slog to get through. Another issue, and admittingly this one is more nit-picky on my end but I know some would take issue with this, is that it is obvious when people aren't being hit.

Overall, great movie and definitely one I'll be thinking about for a while now. I know this isn't a movie for everyone, so I will say is that if you are interested in watching a slow but interesting psychological crime thriller that will make you ponder, then give this a watch!"

Al igual que Taxi Driver la película maneja el estilo del cine negro. Con una fotografía y un buen uso de colores la directora crea escenas con un gran impacto visual y con simbolismos.

La actuación que le valió a  el premio a mejor actor en la pasada edición del Festival de Cannes, es excepcional, logrando meterse completamente en el personaje atormentado y sombrío que tiene que representar. La película logra sacar la esencia de Taxi Driver y así crear escenas de gran logro estilístico."
1292,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/you-were-never-really-here/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Colginator,"Jul 30, 2018",9,"You Were Never Really Here is the story of an ex-FBI agent turned hired gun named Joe (Joaquin Phoenix). He has been hired by a senator to track down a 13 year old girl who was kidnapped and to inflict as much pain on the kidnappers as possible. But in his attempts to track them down, he seems to fall down a rabbit hole which leads to nothing but more violence and pain. However this story is rarely the focus and instead offers Lynne Ramsay to explore who Joe is and the horrible memories that plague his mind. As a hit-man he’s very effective, taking down his targets with nothing more than a hammer, some duct tape and a plastic bag. But as a person he is a fractured individual who is unable to escape the demons from his violent past.

This past as rarely talked about, but instead we have to piece his past through brief glimpses of the person Joe has become. We see this through the physical scars on his back, dark memories of an abusive father and sudden flashbacks of the horrors he witnessed whilst working as an FBI agent. There are often times when Joe will be doing something as mundane as waiting for a train, when we’ll suddenly get the distinct impression that he’s seriously considering jumping on to the tracks. In spite of having relatively little dialogue, Phoenix’s performance sits alongside the greats like Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver or Christian Bale in American Psycho as a portrait of a man who is unable to escape the dark thoughts which are plaguing his mind. His constant detachment to almost everyone around him mixed with his look of pure anguish shows the hard life he has put himself in, whether he deserves to be there or not. Oddly enough, in spite of how much death and violence happens in the film, we rarely see these acts of violence on screen. Instead we are often left with the visual aftermath of this violence, along with the physical and emotional scars that Joe carries with him. It distinguishes the film from other detective thrillers and mixed with Jonny Greenwood's pulsating score perfectly capturing the rhythm of the films hypnotic imagery. But the main thing that shines through the film is Lynne Ramsay’s vision of this painful life. She never relents on the cold atmosphere of violence that Joe seems to be trapped in and through this creates a powerful feature showing a damaged life, but still somehow leaves enough light at the end of the tunnel to make us think that some kind of redemption or release could still be possible."
1293,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/you-were-never-really-here/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GrantD243,"Jul 27, 2018",8,"Story: A middle-aged, ex-military man named Joe (Joaquin Phoenix) spends his days tracking down young girls for their parents, and he's willing to get violent if they're in some kind of trouble. At night, however, he returns to his home with his mother and is a relatively good son. After starting what he thought would be a fairly simple job, an event happens that completely changes everything, and he is forced down a very interesting, and brutal, path. This is a dark and violent story. And I say story because a lot of the actual brutality isn't shown. There's a very violent scene that's shown through security cameras, which lessens the blow of the scene. Also, a lot of the kills are also shown in ways that let the audience know what is happening but don't show them all of the blows like some other films do, such as Drive. I'm not opposed to this kind of stuff being shown on-screen, but I really respect the decision by the director to have such a brutal story but not necessarily show all of the brutality to the audience. I think a big reason for this choice is because the audience isn't necessarily meant to focus on the violence but rather on the story, and how truly dark it is. The director didn't want this to be a typical revenge story that people go to see just for the action. The path Joe ends up on as a result of this job reveals stuff that happens in the real world that we often don't want to think about. The way Joe's backstory and motivation behind what he does is incredibly well done. It's done through little flashbacks throughout the film, and we don't truly understand these flashbacks until we need to. This film also subverts expectations towards the end in a way that I initially made me think ""Ah, man"", but the more I thought about it the more I liked the way the story concluded. However, I think a big reason for the mixed reaction this film has received from general audiences is because of the choices I just mentioned. People who go in expecting lots of on-screen violence? They'll be disappointed. People who can't get over how the little twist towards the end? They'll really make their displeasure known. It is inevitable with films like this one.

Characters: Joaquin Phoenix once again puts in a tremendous performance as Joe, and if anything this performance gave me confidence that he's going to do the Joker justice. Sure, he's technically the good guy in this film, but there's a lot of darkness inside his character and he does a really great job of portraying that. Script: This film won best screenplay at the Sundance Film Festival, so it's no surprise that the script is fantastic. Overall: Like most indie films, this one isn't for everyone, but I thought it was very good. Go for the story, not for the violence."

Not much happens in the movie and a lot of the camera shots are purely for visual and doesn't add anything.

The absolutely electrifying gifts that both Lynne Ramsay and Joaquin Phoenix give us in You Were Never Really Here unite in such a way that is rarely seen in any medium. This work of art does everything it sets out to do and more; every shot is a painting, every sound is carefully chosen, and every moment brings the audience along in a way that knows better than we do. You Were Never Really Here is a film that doesn’t mind being misunderstood on a surface level because it penetrates its viewers so deeply, it cannot be denied.

From the very beginning, You Were Never Really Here displays its artful cinematography and disorienting sound as it takes us through the life of a broken man. Joaquin Phoenix disappears into his role and makes the viewers feel genuinely empathetic and completely terrified at the same time. The seamless and creative editing allows the audience to soak in his ugly life and feel his disjointed reality. This precision in every frame (artfully crafted by Ramsay), in each performance (all paced by Phoenix), and in each sound results in an experience that is unparalleled. I expect You Were Never Really Here to be in the discussion for Best Picture of the Year all year.

A câmera calma e fresca de Townend encontra textura rica e contraste em imagens aparentemente comuns, seja uma faixa de sombra passando por uma omoplata quando ela se enrola, ou a ondulação aveludada de um saco de lixo debaixo d'água. A edição do Bini, combinando linhas do tempo e pontos de vista em pinceladas brilhantes, dá ao filme o ritmo de um curto espaço de tempo em uma queima lenta. Enquanto isso, o hipnótico hipnótico personagem de apoio de Greenwood talvez até supere suas colaborações de Paul Thomas Anderson por sua variedade instrumental e sua bravata, passando de gritos para o violão discordante de uma guitarra com o que soa como um par de cordas estaladas. Em um filme de Lynne Ramsay, até mesmo os elementos off-key são perfeitamente escolhidos; um estudo requintado e ansioso em danos, ""You Were Never Really Here"" sabe exatamente o valor de suas cicatrizes."

After the excellent We Need to Talk About Kevin, Lynne Ramsay has outdone herself with You Were Never Really Here. She has proven herself to be one of the best directors working today. This movie is a tour de force reminiscent of Taxi Driver. It's one of those rare movies in which the acting, direction, and soundtrack combine to create a work of art that is greater than the sum of its parts. Though the movie is often violent and disturbing, there are many moments of beauty as well, such as Nina quietly counting backward while riding in the car or water slowly dripping off of her hair. Joaquin Phoenix, as usual, is a revelation. He absolutely deserved his Best Actor award at Cannes. Also, Jonny Greenwood has created probably his best score to-date for this film. Some of the music reminds me of Remain in Light by Talking Heads. VERY cool. Try to see it while it is still in theaters!!"
1303,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/you-were-never-really-here/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,benskylerhill,"May 10, 2018",8,"I have yet to see Joaquin Phoenix give a performance in which he does not completely steal the show. You Were Never Really Here just may be his greatest, most raw work yet. It never, not even for a second, feels like he’s acting. I never once saw an actor on the screen, but a broken, sick man in search of some sort of meaning to his life.

You Were Never Really Here is not a film meant for casual viewing. Its dark and brutal subject matter of PTSD, sex trafficking, depression, corruption, abuse of authority, and violence is explored in great detail. But the way it’s portrayed makes for a deeply moving story. The direction style goes for a lot of symbolic storytelling and for the most part, it works. When it does work, it presents a strong commentary on the dark aspects of life and how there’s always some light at the end of the tunnel.

But where this film doesn’t really work lies in much of its presentation. There are some plot points and character arcs that feel like they have entire scenes missing from them. The plot synopses of this movie tell us that the main character, Joe, is a Gulf War veteran and an ex-FBI agent but there’s little to no material in the film itself to tell us that. There are some flashback scenes that almost feel unfinished, like they don’t really fulfil their purpose in telling us about the characters. Although the musical score works very well with how the movie is shot, the visual editing is choppy between scenes and the pacing is uneven, often shifting quickly between slow and fast pacing that makes for a confusing experience.

But these issues don’t detract from the overall effectiveness that the film shows in delivering its message in a forceful way. The fantastic performances and simplistic, melancholy script immersed me in the life of Joe in such a way that I truly felt he was real, and that made his experiences that much more meaningful and relatable by the end of the story.

You Were Never Really Here is an ambitious work of art. It juggles a lot of controversial, uncomfortable themes and even though it sometimes fails to hold them all in place and articulate them to their necessary extent, it manages to come through with a hopeful, emotionally resonant narrative that is essential viewing in these difficult times we live in.

Sometimes you come out of a theater and think to yourself ""what have I just seen?""
Usually an experience like that leaves me irritated or even frustrated about time wasted. Not this movie.

It is full of memory flashes some of which might be dreams that never occurred.

Reality mixed with a sick mind's hallucinations of a war veteran with PTSD who was abused as a boy.

You never have a full picture, only small fragments, and you have to think to make it  whole. That is intriguing in itself since you cannot be sure you got it right.

Great performance by Joaquin Phoenix, intense albeit somewhat intrusive sound track, fantastic cinematography.

Overall, a piece of art made by talented people."

Everything about Lynne Ramsay's film is meticulous and intentional.  Not a single scene is wasted as she paces out the story and character development perfectly.  Every flashback, every brutal beating, every intimate, claustrophobic shot of hair, foot, or scar is handcrafted with immaculate care and beautiful framing and focus.  Lynne Ramsay creates a portrait of abuse and brokenness that feels intensely personal, communicating unspeakable rage, drowning guilt, immense sadness, and dreadful loss.  The music is flawless, blending electronic, urban vibes with tense, idiosyncratic strings and wood basses.

I must say the ridiculous comparison of being the Taxi Driver of the 21st century will make a lot of people to judge it with an unjustified fierceness and although the comparison could be considered somewhat fair because of certain similarities in the story, the truth is that both movies could not be more different from each other. And I'm perfectly aware and I know that I must give credit to the director because she manages to maintain an interesting and stable narrative, despite the fact the story gets some rhythm setbacks but the person who deserves full recognition is Joaquin Phoenix and I say this because his performance is top notch and really committed. He gives the film another face. He's the one who puts it in a different plane and without a doubt offers a bigger showcase for those who don't know Lynne Ramsay's work. Many people said this is her best film but even though I liked it a lot, ''We Need To Talk About Kevin'' will continue as my favorite but ''You Were Never Really Here'' is a film that any film lover should be watching."

Joaquin Phoenix gave such a powerhouse performance. He was the best choice to play the character of Joe who is devastated and traumatized but also very gritty and ruthless.

The use of imagery is just incredibly magnificent. I really can't remember any filmmaker who used the allegory that good in maybe the last 5 years like Lynne Ramsay did in this movie. that was so clever and intelligent, and the most important thing is that I haven't felt the metaphors were stilted or something, they were very important to the character development and therefore the story itself; as this movie has a character-driven plot. The strange thing that it seems that the problem I have with this movie maybe has something to do with the use of imagery. I wanted to be more invested in the movie, and as I tend to dramatic themes, I think more engagement was required from me to be 100 percent interested in the characters and the story in such a film that relies heavily on imagery, especially with the slow pacing. That being said, sometimes the movie hit me right in the core of my heart and even almost made me cry!

The cinematography and is mesmerizing and beautiful despite the dark atmosphere it has created, and Jonny Greenwood's score is captivating as usual, but the editing, especially the sound editing, is what makes this movie even more special; it is actually plays a vital role in the part of storytelling. I don't want to ruin anything for who haven't seen the movie yet, but all i can say is that the editing in this movie is a requisite tool, nay a technique!

Here's something else great about this movie, it paid homages to Taxi Driver, Psycho, No Country for Old Men and maybe other movies, and I have never felt they were forced to the movie or something. Actually all these homages were professionally merged with the plot.

Phoenix is obviously the actor that fits the bill since his role in ""the Master"" where he displayed the same hypnotic charisma and, in that film, even has the look of an old wounded lion with his shaggy mane.

Elliptical structure works because the pulpy source material has been boiled down to its emotional beats (very reminiscent of “Point Blank” in that respect). Not concerned with plot details, it nevertheless has a propulsive energy that kicks in once the “mission” begins and never lets up. The final scene is incredibly powerful — more thematically lucid than some of the reviews led me to believe. (If those critics really didn’t see the point of this movie, they had no business reviewing it in the first place.) It’s easily Phoenix’s best performance and just one of Ramsay’s several masterpieces — she is the DNA of cinema. But she doesn’t spoon feed. She makes you work for the rewards.

It has been compared to Taxi Driver because there isn’t really anything else you can compare it to. It’s reminiscent of Taxi Driver particularly when it comes to the main plot and the soundtrack but it almost seems unfair to compare the two, Taxi Driver is the better film.

Joaquin Phoenix is chilling, a broken man, suffering from PTSD. He devotes his time to help track down missing girls. His methods are brutal but when he becomes caught up in a bigger case than once appeared things quickly escalate. It’s offbeat and very slow to build. Brutal and disturbing but if you’re expecting to see extreme violence it’s best to know that the majority of it happens off camera. You Were Never Really Here is all about the atmosphere yet what stood out the most was Joaquin Phoenix. This part was perfect for him and if you think I’m going on and on about it then you better find a cinema screening this and see it for yourselves. Very dark, a thriller in its simplest form.

From its musings on life, death and time, to its take on the meanings behind all three, the film is virtually replete with sobering, stark and beautiful ideas, gently goading the audience towards developing their own interpretations after the film concludes. It's a total gem to look at as well, what with its arresting cinematography, terrifically well-thought-out scene transitions and its understandably melancholic approach to costuming and production design. The beginning's a bit of a trudge — with the infamous pie-eating scene marking just one of the many long takes I honestly still find myself questioning the need for — but once you're past that, it's non-stop fascination."

A Ghost Story é estranhamente acolhedor e pessimista, principalmente indo do ponto de que, ao que tudo indica, é interpretativo.

Sua narrativa é única. O modo como os elementos são postos tem uma identidade própria advinda da Direção junto a fotografia - que fazem dessa obra inconfundível. Como eu tinha dito acima, esse filme abre uma grande margem para interpretações. A experiência gira em torno de como você assistiu o filme.

Pus-me a pensar o tempo todo. Queria entender o que estava acontecendo, tentando pôr as regras daquele universo e assimilar alguma coisa, mas tudo que tive foi vazio. A vida aqui é abordada de maneira tão fútil quanto ela é. A trama acompanha o fantasma através de uma passagem de tempo um tanto quanto incompreensível, o que nos leva a mais questionamentos de como tudo aquilo funciona. O diretor experimentou muitos planos longos, que nos fazem pensar e imergir ainda mais no que é visto. A OST faz seu papel em diversos momentos, dando a sensação de que somos o fantasma e estamos de passagem com ele. A fotografia é única e merece elogios. A cena do homem na festa é sensacional e toda a composição, desde a sua fala a fotografia, é muito bem feita, fazendo com que não tiremos nosso olho da tela. O plot final é um tanto quanto confuso e interpretativo.

Eu não sei bem dizer se entendi o filme, ou se tudo que vi foi uma reafirmação do que eu já sabia. Mas ai que tá, seria esse ou não o propósito do diretor? De qualquer forma, o fato de me fazer refletir tanto com ""tão pouco"" já me faz respeitar essa obra, que vai além de uma narrativa convencional e convida o  publico a algo novo, quase como um desafio a si próprio."

When I originally saw the trailers, though, I thought the concept of Casey Affleck's character actually wearing a sheet while playing a ghost was kind of silly, so I never watched it in theaters. But, I was very wrong for thinking that because this is an excellent film. The premise **** Story is pretty simple. C (Casey Affleck) and M (Rooney Mara) are a couple who live in a simple, little house in what looks like the outskirts of a suburb. The relationship is established as one that is loving but also susceptible to conflict over seemingly minor things. The biggest of which is the idea of moving out of the house and to something nicer. M wants to, but C doesn't. He likes the house a lot. Unfortunately, in the end it doesn't really matter as C is killed in a car accident mere feet away from the house. He returns, but this time as a ghost. We then see everything he sees for the rest of the film. We watch as he watches his wife slowly move on and out of his (post) life for good. Basically, a large portion of this film is a ghost coping with his own death, and the consequences of it. And I really, really enjoyed it, but I don't think it's much of a surprise that this film isn't for everyone. There's not a whole lot of dialogue, there's no action, and cinematography wise there's nothing super compelling outside of some fairly long takes. It's more thought provoking than entertaining. Impressive in its own right is that this film was made with a production budget of only $100,000. I'm not saying that it's not noticeable that this was a low budget film, but I am impressed with just how much David Lowery was able to do with so little. This isn't the most entertaining film I'll ever watch, but it's hard not to admire the craftsmanship that went into putting it together, and I appreciate that it actually made me think after the credits started to roll."

This is a work of complex art and it should be viewed as such. There is very sparse dialogue throughout as it relies mostly on visual, symbolic storytelling to convey its message of how grief, the passage of time, and love affect the human soul. And I must say, it accomplishes this beautifully.

There is very little acting and there are few spoken lines in this film, but when these things are made manifest, they don’t distract from the visual narrative but rather add to it. The performances are so emotion-packed even though they hardly speak, and when they do speak there’s so much depth to what’s said that it’s worth watching the movie a second time to unpack the layers of symbolism beneath.

The cinematography is near perfection. Every shot, every scene, every camera angle, every colour is perfectly suited for the tone of the scene and it’s combined with music that’s hypnotic and pierces the soul with a shot of emotion and contemplation.

A Ghost Story is not built for an ordinary watching experience. It’s an intricate allegory about human nature and life and death. People who are not interested in thinking hard about a film will be bored out of their skulls, but for those keen on art, it’s the best piece of storytelling through imagery since Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.

I did not think what the title says was literal. I assumed some person with social-shy, wore a white cloth like a mask to confront it. Totally surprised by what I saw. Frankly, I did not like at the first. It was a boring start. I could not overcome that pie eating scene. It was damn too long for nothing. That kinds are the source of boredom. But the actress did good on that. Then what followed were amazing. I truly was not expected that. So at the end, I thought it was an average, then thought a decent and finally realised its something unique and awesome. The lesson is, the more time you give between watching the film and your opinion, the result would only get better.

Well the story was so simple. A couple with their average life get affected when one of them dies in a car accident. Soon the ghost resides the house looking for a reason to stay. It is kind of a love story from another dimension. As the time passes on, things change and complicates the quest. But there's always a way to fix it, even for a ghost, so how its been done and what it is was the remaining story.

The cast was good, but most of the film it was about the ghost, which could have been anybody inside the sheet. So can't appreciate particularly anyone. As I have heard, Casey did all those parts as he should be. Even though that was not a praisable performance than a simple presence. It's his second collaboration with the director along with Rooney Mara. The one question that everybody who saw it needed to be answered is what was the note says. I googled and got the Q&A with the director that says, nobody knows, not even Mara remembers what she wrote.

This is one of the best films. With or without reason the story happened. But that's not the matter, instead, how cleverly, such a concept was developed and made into a film makes the interesting fact. They even did not require a higher end graphics, except in small quantity. It will gain a cult status and as the years go by, it will be considered one of best 1,000 films. So recommend it, but be patient, at least in the initial stage and take a day to give an opinion on it. Maybe reading articles about the plot if you have a doubt is good. Really a creative film!

A Ghost Story is a simple and yet puzzling story upon looking deeper into it's roots. Everything from great acting, directing, cinematography and excellent framing.

Can be described as a fascinating piece of art, that if I told you it's the same director of ""Peter's Dragon"", you'll think it's a joke. A little bit too obvious with the main message. The whole thing is still emotional moving though.

I can see why some may think this is pretentious, but it did something that's so close to our thoughts and isn't at all shallow. However, the middle part literally explains the meaning of the story by a certain character. But strangely what that character said was pretty thought-provoking.

1349,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-ghost-story/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Spangle,"Oct 5, 2017",8,"Heading into A Ghost Story, one cannot be blamed for assuming it is an examination of grief. With a young husband (Casey Affleck) dying early on and wife (Rooney Mara) mourning his loss, eating pie, and trying to move on without him, it is easy to see how the film is about grief. Yet, in equal measure, it is a film about memory, time, purpose, music, stories, and every little detail that makes life so eternal, so essential, and universal. It is a film about grief shown through the lens of an unexpected protagonist - the ghost under a sheet - who traverses time, space, people, and location. Powerful, poignant, and silently accomplished, A Ghost Story is a rousing return to form for director David Lowery after working for Disney last year. In this low-key, gorgeous, and powerful film, Lowery re-establishes himself as the heir apparent to Terrence Malick's cinematic poetry throne.

Silently sewing together images, Lowery's camera frequently finds stunning images. From the very beginning, shots of Affleck's ghost walking through open fields to get back home with the sun peaking over the horizon, the ghost lurking in the background with Mara in the foreground, or the shot of light pouring in as the home is destroyed, A Ghost Story is a film with stunning visuals. This was very much the case with Lowery's prior effort Ain't Them Bodies Saints - which also starred Affleck and Mara - and it is nice to see him return to this gorgeous style. However, compared to that film, Lowery is much less reliant on the beauty of the outdoors to create stunning imagery in A Ghost Story. Rather, he now relies upon drab gray and brown interiors, dark shadows, and a largely gloomy home that is fashioned as a prison cell for this ghost for the rest of eternity until he finds what he has been looking for all this time. Dark, ominous, and spooky, this locale is one that would work for a horror film, but rather, Lowery uses it as a place for existential horror. This ghost is doomed to stay here until he can get the note left behind by Mara that he wants to retrieve, yet he is unable to break through the painted wall to reach the note. Trapped, lonely, and solemn, the ghost's existence is one of little joy, pain (especially when Mara tries to move on), and anger at how he has been so easily forgotten.

However, what is perhaps most interesting is how the aspect ratio communicates so much. Lowery himself has stated it was to make the film more claustrophobic to show how trapped the ghost is in this home, but that is just scratching the surface. With a squareish frame and rounded edges with drab colors, the film often looks like an old photograph. This is particularly pertinent due to the film's thoughts regarding memories and the little pieces of ourselves that we leave behind. Being remembered, our memories, and our brief time on Earth after which we are forgotten forever, are all constantly on the mind **** Story throughout. Mara leaving little notes of things she likes in houses she moves from, the quiet mourning of her husband, and a party guest speaking about memory and Beethoven, all exemplify this element of the film. Yet, what is abundantly clear in A Ghost Story is that time does not matter. It will advance, things will be left behind, people die, and people move on to other places. In the end, the only thing that does matter are the little pieces of ourselves we leave in the hearts and souls of those we touch. As Affleck silently lingers in the background with Mara eating a piece of pie, this fact is felt. She does not need to say anything, nor does he. Both miss one another and it is not because they existed, were in that home, or were even because they were married. Rather, it is because they both touched one another's lives and, now, circumstance and a freak accident have taken them apart from one another. Instead of holding one another, they now are left wallow in the solitude and thickness of the air in the home as they try to soothe the hole in their hearts.

With a minimal script that often amounts to a character standing stationary for a period of time to the ambitious time traveling finale, A Ghost Story is a film that is nearly impossible to not compare to the work of Malick. Yet, it is not just in the style and ambition that Lowery manages to capture the feeling of Malick's best works, but also in the feelings they emote. The best Malick films, such as The Tree of Life, are ambitious and show life from the very beginning to the present day with a silent, melodic, and poetic flow to the proceedings. A Ghost Story is very much the same way. Instead of being a typical narrative film, A Ghost Story is often best described as visual poetry. Through small suggestions, such as what is on the paper (it is the quote from the book that Affleck knocks off the shelf and Mara reads for sure), or through this gorgeous mosaic of images that, on their own, often communicate every emotion and purpose perfectly, Lowery"

This movie no doubt comes to mess with what an art film represents and what it can mean for people who do not consume or enjoy these types of movies, after all, this movie has been called boring, tedious, pretentious, overrated and yes also a masterpiece and let's be honest, all those things may be fair depending on what each person is looking for in a movie.

And yet how can I review this movie? honestly I'm still not sure even while I'm writing this. I have my interpretation and I am pretty sure of it.

Primarily A Ghost Story is all about contemplation, a dense contemplation, we have about 15 minutes to meet our protagonists, we know they love each other, they are together and they seem to be happy, but that life disappears when the life of Cassey Affleck's character ends in an accident, what follows now is the contemplation of the loss, the grief and the mourning. We watch Rooney Mara's character continuing with her life while the ghost of Casey's character follows her tirelessly until she finally leaves the house they both shared.

The following are other points of reflection but they feed on a singular point which is strongly focused on mortality and our own legacy, our own significance and our own irrelevance, is a strong and solid meditation on love, anguish, memories, loneliness and continuation, what we lived, what we felt, what we loved and what we lost.

It is a teaching and perhaps it leaves the message that eventually if there is a life after death and we must go on into that unknown path maybe everything we built throughout our lives will not mean nothing in the end, but they meant something while we live and maybe that's the final message of this movie with that final scene, moving on after recalling what made you live in the first place. Closure for our souls, maybe someday we'll all experience it somehow, who knows?"

1354,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-ghost-story/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TrevorsView,"Jul 28, 2017",7,"The art house may not always be your go-to place for a good time out, particularly amidst the summer blockbuster season, but let me say: it often draws paths to the answers of whatever life questions you may regularly ponder. Although A Ghost Story falls into the category of “love it or hate it,” please know that it came from A24, the remarkable independent studio which brought us life-changing works about the inner human spirit, such as Ex Machina, Room, The Lobster, Swiss Army Man, and Moonlight. Now, they did it again with this almost silent film that exploits its tiny sixty-member cast and crew.

The director/editor David Lowery (Pete’s Dragon) has proven his mastery over both of his responsibilities; he follows what more experimental filmmakers do nowadays, and utilizes long uninterrupted shots to its greatest power. The camera seldom moves as it lingers on the small moments for an uncomfortable length of time—the moments he chooses to linger on supposedly communicate nothing, calling us to wait in anticipation.

Lowery can truly make each frame tell its own story under its 4:3 aspect ratio, the corners rounded off, as if watching a hopeless widow’s Instagram story. You could literally watch it on your phone for the compatibility of its visual style! He stated before how he “wanted to make something small and tiny and handmade,” (Filmmaker Magazine) and he well and beyond fulfills what he hinted at, as he creates such a cold environment inside the claustrophobic house the weary spirit refuses to leave. Especially in the large-scale moments, such as a walk in the grassy plain, Lowery keeps things as intimate as possible.

The ghost’s simple design intrigues the senses: the familiar white bedsheet with holes cut in for the eyes creates some hauntingly surreal imagery. Nobody can see him there under the sheets from his hospital deathbed other than us the spectators, turning the already unsettling vision of a white strolling figure all the more eerie.

You can for certain love the accompanying musical score by Daniel Hart, (The Exorcist TV series) whose work echoes against itself as if the purpose of music could never be understood until you croaked. I highly recommend buying the soundtrack.

However, like other new directors given a limited $100,000 budget, several issues still blare hot amidst the triumphs. Spoilers out of the way, the third act features time travel elements that receive too little time spent on sensical explanations. Its “open to interpretation” story gets too carried away with itself for public appeal. The ethnical casting decisions also causes distance between reality, as explorations of the limited cultural space are brilliant, yet Whitewashed: an Americanized Mexican family structure comes to mind, as well as a tribe of savage Native Americans. Likewise, two White drop-dead gorgeous celebrity A-listers play the lead roles, and barely any information is communicated about what these two lovers think of one another.

Rather, the aftermath of the death triggers the most empathy. If you have ever been in love or felt in love, the silent loneliness each individual faces will deeply resonate. The eerie nature of a widow being watched by her dead husband skyrockets in sorrow; you too want their wants due to actions rather than words.

The two leads, both together and apart, allow you to feel as hollow as the spirit on the poster. The husband, played by Casey Affleck (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Manchester by the Sea) wears the cotton sheet throughout 95% of the runtime, stunningly sad in posture just by staring with his misty nonexistent eyes. As for the wife, played by Rooney Mara, (Carol, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) you feel her pain just by her eating a full pie until she pukes. When close up, she has no need to give a dramatic cry-face to express your tears as she listens to her former-husband’s original music.

Lowery understands his craft in blocking actors, with strict emphasis on posture, such as when the live husband cuddles his wife in bed or strokes her sobbing body with his cloaked, disembodied hand. He can generate the most out of each performance, even if one of them only exists to spill out philosophies around the theme.

Lowery has demonstrated his ultimate strength as a director in constructing this effective, nonpreachy message.

1362,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/widows/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LegitSalt,"Feb 27, 2019",8,"Steve McQueen has been hailed by many as one of the best filmmakers working right now, with critically acclaimed films such as Hunger, Shame, and 12 Years a Slave. He certainly doesn’t disappoint this time either, delivering one of the, if not the, best heist films of the decade. While it is true that the genre is generally niche and stale, Widows proves that you needn’t conform to genre clichés when making a heist film. The film has characters testing allegiances and getting even for the damage caused by a heist gone wrong. With a female-centred cast, McQueen reverses traditional gender roles in a uniquely interesting way. The movie’s resolution and success are brought about by the diminutive view that men in power have of women and in particular widows. Another unique element that the film manages to pull off is having two distinct “villain” parties, each of which being threatening in their own regard. However, the black gang, and especially Kaluuya’s character are viscerally menacing. Their intimidating presence is felt from their first scene, and they succeed where most villains don’t, i.e. they are neither overly lofty nor meek. Kaluuya could easily be the best villain of the year, when he wants something, he gets it, for the most part. The other “villain” party is the in-power, subtly racist white faction who seek to exploit the black community for profit, political advantage, and “their own good”. Through gerrymandering, misinformation, and abuse of power, Farrell’s character hits far too close to home. Generally, the writing is quite good, side a few scenes, and the acting is remarkable from all players. The final twist is seemingly cliché but resolved well. The heist scenes themselves were tense and rewarding. Overall, this movie delivers incisive social commentary accompanied by an engaging tale of mourning and revenge."

It is one of the best films of 2018 and a masterpiece in it's genre. It blows my mind this film was not nominated for any American awards as I feel like this is the type of film that film schools would lecture on.  So many stand out things from gorgeous shots to a tight screenplay and that scene in the car was incredible! All of the characters especially Davis' and Debicki (she was incredible)were so interesting - and not take way from Rodriguez/Enrivo whom also held their own. The entire cast performance was stellar -and the social commentary was subtle and smart.  The use of violence to drive the story and create tension and suspense was perfect. This film was a beautiful marriage of style and substance - It's a masterpiece. I may even give it a third watch with my teens to discuss it.

Lets not forget about Collin Farrell and Brian Tyree Henry who are in the movie to remind us that when it comes to money and power, greed and sick ambition do not distinguish between where you come from, when the game's stakes are high you will be dirty just like anyone else. Movie is tense, well directed and I encourage everyone to watch it. Most of the actors are well characterized in their roles and offer genuine, well rounded perspective on how is to try to survive in mighty Chicago.

His first film in 5 years in a way feels like a setback because he had been growing with each film he had been making and here he didn't. It's a very well made film. The cast is phenomenal and McQueen knows how to get the most out of them but I couldn't feel as amazed as I did with all his previous films and that's a shame and big issue.

Just to pick one small example, there is a ""throw away"" scene shot into the luxury SUV driving Colin Farrell home from a speech in a poor neighborhood. As we learn a little about his cynicism (and the public and private face), the homes outside quickly shift to upper class in a matter of blocks. There is much depth to the story beyond the entertaining genre. McQueen and his cast elevate the film to so much more then a successful heist story. Highly recommended."

Dirigida por Steve McQueen nominado y ganador del Academy Award a Best Motion Picture Of The Year del 2014 por ser el responsable de 12 Years A Slave y también director de Shame (2011), Widows es uno de los mejores guiones que he visto en éste año.
Widows narra la historia de un grupo de mujeres que busca la estabilidad después de que un accidente las dejara sin esposos. Esta historia está basada en el libro del mismo nombre escrita por Lynda La Plante, la adaptación la hizo el mismo McQueen junto a Gillian Flynn, escritora de, tanto la novela como el guión, Gone Girl (2014) y la reciente serie llamada Sharp Objects con Amy Adams y Patricia Clarkson.
En general, la película es un ejercicio correcto y profesional de cinematografía. Desde la primera secuencia el público puede darse cuenta de que el presupuesto no es ningún problema, y, gracias a eso, se siente como McQUeen dirige con toda tranquilidad y comodidad. Visualmente hay varias escenas interesantes de observar, varios planos y movimientos complejos para mostrar cosas simples que le otorga a la película cierto dinamismo visual y funciona como una carnada mental para el público. La fotografía también está bien cuidada, no es la más espectacular del año, pero la corrección de color, los planos y varias secuencias de persecución y acción, junto con los cortes que se agregan en la post-producción generan una actividad visual mur enérgica y activa. Es difícil no entretenerse con todo el juego y el casi espectacular viaje que los personajes tienen en la historia.
En los personajes hay una completud en sus posturas que hace sentir seguro al público. Cada una de las posturas se explica ingeniosamente a través de la forma en la que cada chica resuelve sus propios obstáculos. El elenco, conformado por la hermosisima e increiblemente talentosa Viola Davis junto a Michelle Rodriguez, Elizabeth Debicki y Cynthia Erivo, crean un gran interacción. Cada postura ofrece una versión personal y puntual del valor de la fuerza, la personalidad, el ingenio y la voluntad. A pesar de que la historia no las lleva a generar un drama puro, sí las guía hacia la toma de fuerza necesaria para ser imponentes en la pantalla. Ninguna de ellas se queda corta y todas sorprenden con la forma en la que adoptan el papel y lo expresan.
La historia o el guión es lo que más tiene éxito en este proyecto, pues su complejidad presenta una puesta en escena sobre un nivel de hostilidad social tan grande que parece absurda, pero es totalmente realista. El ingenio está desde la idealización principal, pues presenta varias situaciones de estabilidad que tienen el poder de representar a varias mujeres de la actualidad, y con el mismo ritmo veloz con las que las presenta, las libera. En medio de esa liberación las mujeres se encontrarán con la dificultad e ignorancia de saber qué hacer con esa libertad. Sin embargo, gracias a la unión de personalidades, la prioridad que le dan a recuperar su propia estabilidad les da un plan con el cual luchar. Y en medio de esa lucha cada mujer encuentra y se arraiga a su propio poder, sus propias capacidades y sus voluntades mismas de ser por ellas mismas. Como si fuera poco, en medio de ese empoderamiento, también se revelan problemas, complejidades y dilemas políticos y sociales que representan los problemas racistas, sexistas, clasistas, machistas, superficiales y estereotipicos que existen en la actualidad. Cada personaje tiene un propósito y cada propósito choca en una red social compleja y peligrosa que existe gracias a una cadena alimenticia de poder e intenciones. En esta historia, no importa quien seas, si no impones tu propia fuerza de voluntad, no conseguirás lo que quieres; pero con lo que nadie contaba es que las mujeres también pueden jugar, y también tienen una voluntad.
Widows explota en todos los sentidos: le da al público una película de acción decente y también le da un drama importante, sorprende con la sensibilidad que expresa en la transición de situación a decisión y entretiene con la intensidad de sus escenas de acción. Widows es una carta de empoderamiento que dicta qué, en este mundo lleno de hombres hostiles y sin humanidad, las mujeres son las ganadoras indudables del juego. No porque ella sean mejor que los hombres, sino porque los hombres están ciegos con su orgullo. Realmente me la pesé muy bien al ver Widows y la recomendaría, no solo por el suspenso bien creado, sino por los discursos bien construidos."

The action is brutal and well utilized when it's needed, and the characters are all likable to a certain extent. Further, the story is enthralling from beginning to end. The ""twist"" is a little predictable, but it adds yet another layer to what is already a fairly complex film. It's just a well rounded film."

1379,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/widows/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,jeremyp,"Nov 30, 2018",7,"I have to think that the critics went for this one because it's by a famed Black Director. It's basically a not very good heist movie that's overly violent, full of plot holes, and some ludicrous suspend belief plotting. It lacks depth, and the action allows one to forget that, and the actual heist takes up less than a couple of minutes. Other than Viola Davis and Debicki the ladies get scant screen time, and they waste the great Carrie Coon, and there is not enough of Erivo, who steals the movie."
1380,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/widows/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Nov 27, 2018",8,"I became a fan of Viola Davis's in 2008 when she stole her scenes from Meryl Streep in ""Doubt"" and I am fascinated by what she can do with her face in the ""How To Get Away With Murder"" television series and I never miss an episode. Though I haven't seen any of the ""Fast and Furious"" films in which she has starred I have always felt some empathy for Michelle Rodriguez and her many run-ins with the law. I have heard a lot, both pro and con, about Cynthia Erivo regarding her star-making role on stage in the musicalized version ""The Color Purple"" but this is the first time I have seen her. Talking about the first time, I don't ever recall seeing Elizabeth Debick before but once you do you won't forget her and it would be a spoiler if I said anything more about that introduction!

The ""Widows"" is about women taking charge in basically what would be a men's genre, a heist film. Director Steve McQueen, mainly known for ""12 Years A Slave"", directs, and co-wrote the script with Gillian Flynn, author of ""Gone Girl"", keeping the pace quick with some outstanding camera work. There are many twists and turns and at points, just a bit too much regarding sex, race, politics and social issues along with too much unnecessary violence but the film is easy to follow except near the end, which I'll get back to in a minute.  No matter where the film goes the women always hold your interest which makes this a better than average heist film.

I do have a couple of questions about the ending but discussing them here would give away some major points and give away some of the surprises so after you have seen the film let's talk!

The film could have been tightened up a bit regarding its over 2 hour playing time just by cutting out Robert Duvall's storyline, not that he isn't good but it really doesn't add anything to the film, the storyline or the heist but does add to the Chicago politics of the time.

Be prepared for some laughs, certainly a jump out of your seat once or twice and definitely a jolt at some of the violence but ""Widows"" entertains plus allows the audience to watch some fine acting by the actresses. I am not ignoring the men but it is hard talking about their roles without giving spoilers except to say, maybe, that Liam  Neeson is Davis's husband or that Colin Farrell is Duvall's son, etc.

Just watching Viola Davis's face is worth the admission alone!"
1381,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/widows/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,amheretojudge,"Nov 24, 2018",7,"McQueen's fourth installment of this amalgamation of pathos dark crime drama is the least McQueen-y up till now.

Widows

McQueen's incongruent tale is perpetually stable in its tone. And it's that stability that helps McQueen stay on the track, no matter how much the narration fluctuates, from escaping gun shots to struggling through a trauma, his language speaks fluently to the audience. The script pretty much revolves around a heist-gone-wrong but it is a character driven feature with characters in aplenty. And often whilst fiddling with these many characters, the grip starts to lose in the narration but this is where McQueen swoops in and saves the day. The messy relationships, hidden past, cutthroat politics, morality conflict is the real ruggedness that keeps it grounded and essentially crispy.

On driver's seat, Davis has a tricky part to play. Her, resisting through the trauma and going on an entirely new track is equally competent and sincerely portrayed. Neeson as his supporter gets a lot on his plate than one would imagine and he has held on to it decently. The frustrated character of Farrell whose career is plummeting down and often at the borderline risk of being disclosed of his true self, bodes well with the storyline even though is stereotypical. His conversations with Duvall; who still can overpower anyone on the screen, are one of the finest bits of the film. Debicki, the ""weak"" link of the group, gets almost as wide range as Davis's complex character.

She gets to be the reason of the ""pity"" and also an inspiring phoenix natured symbol. Rodriguez's character is often game, and isn't put under any surveillance of crisis, her role is pretty much a bullet shot out from the gun and she delivers up to that. Kaluuya has a gritty role to fill in the shoes he does deliver the chills as far as he is on screen. In fact, his character is the one whose threat ticks behind the screen throughout the course of the feature. Since the lead cast is suffering for the screen time itself, the supporting ones like Bernthal and Coon gets lost into bits and pieces.

McQueen's adaptation with his co-writer Flynn is pretty much to make it as cinematic as possible and even though in its second act the script gets slow and non-provocative, the lift up or the elevation is then left to the performers. McQueen's fourth installment of this amalgamation of pathos dark crime drama is the least McQueen-y up till now. He has certainly evolved as a director and kept pushing himself on newer territories to explore. His lens and vision is what rejuvenates this almost a news channel to a compelling drama.

The conversations are written explicitly and with a poker face, the writers never explain the structure and aren't clearly ready compromise. Despite of having few cards hidden under the sleeve, the awe struck moments doesn't go as anticipated. This is McQueen's project where even though he offers everyone an equal chance to steal the show, he soars above all. Widows is an art that pulsates for a hearty non-biased sensitive message that is fabricated with blazing gunpowder and unapologetic deceit."

All of the exceptional actors create interesting characters.

And lets face it the heist genre has been done again and again so it’s refreshing to see one that isn’t just a rehash of Oceans 11. The chemistry between the women is what made this for me, along with the character development. Throw in a slimy politician in the form of Colin Farrell and the generic movie psychopath in the form of Daniel Kaluuya and you’ve got yourself a must see crime thriller. It reels you in with it’s sharp script and realistic characters you don’t sit there questioning the logistics of the plan or the heist you’re fully invested. My only criticism is Liam Neeson, he’s completely miscast and clearly just put in the film to get more people to see it.

“May a man live well-enough and long-enough, to leave many joyful widows behind him.”

Remember Ocean's 8? Nah, neither do I.

‘Widows’ is an outstanding crime drama from director Steve McQueen. A female driven movie that doesn't glorify itself as such. It's smart and compelling - emotional roller coaster through out. The themes of corruption, politicians, sexism, race relations, privileges, and greed that mirrors society we know. I was hooked from start till finish.

Steve McQueen took something that could’ve been a generic mainstream heist movie, but made it so refreshing. Just like ‘First Man’, it’s a complete departure from his other work, but isn’t too different where you can’t believe he directed it. Plenty of long shots, especially how he directed a freestyle rap with the camera spinning around a group of characters. I thought that scene was brilliantly done. There’s a scene where Colin Farrell drives to his house after a election promotion, but McQueen mounts the camera on the hood of the car and we only hear Farrell’s conversation while nothing is visible - which is all done in one shot. Rather than cutting back or forward, but McQueen isn’t flat. His directing is bold and makes every shot engaging.

How about the cast? It’s something to die for. Everyone manages to get their time to shine. Viola Davis is excellent as usual and the main center of a crowded cast. I love the little details with her character: Like how she always carries around a white fluffy dog almost like a child. She can express grief and the weight on her shoulders and play it effortlessly. Honestly, she’s one of the greatest actress of this generation.

Elizabeth Debicki, Michelle Rodriguez, and Cynthia Erivo command the screen whenever they are on. Just like Davis, these wife’s have nothing in common, which serves as development in character with different backgrounds. Great to see Rodriguez finally showing dramatic range.

But Daniel Kaluuya scared the **** out of me. The intensity in his presence and brutal killings makes him a true threat. Every Time he appears on screen, you know something horrible is going to happen. Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall are so great together, which surprised me to learn that both of they scenes, according to McQueen was completely improvised. Even Liam Neeson, despite the small screen time, but he’s really good and I wish he did more dramatic work than any other ‘Taken’ movie.

The other cast members are also great, but we’ll be here for days when naming them off. I could go on forever.

Han Zimmer’s score is nothing short of haunting. Gloomy with a heavy theme of loneliness. However, it picks up pace when the heist shifts in gear and everything from there is tension after tension. The beats gets higher and eventually becomes untamed.

For issues: There’s not a lot for complains. Although if I have to pick. Since there’s so much going on, it can sometimes interrupt the flow. Other than that, that’s really it.

Overall rating: I really struggled to catch a breath."

A daring heist, criminals and gangsters, corrupt politicians, but most of all: four bold women willing to risk everything, all in the name of justice for themselves and their late husbands who were killed in a heist gone wrong. The film boasts and A-list all-star cast, and every one of them give such great performances that I can't really single anybody out for praise. However, I will say that it was really nice to see the four main women this film centered on given a great opportunity to shine in such a bold and gritty narrative that's almost always reserved for men. Themes of empowerment towards them definitely run heavy throughout the film, but the material and story they're given to work with definitely lives up to its potential and blends very well with said themes. The biggest issue with ensemble films however is that sometimes when there's so many characters and story arcs, it's hard to give equal balance to all of them and they aren't quite fully resolved or given the full closure that they deserve. Such is the case with the final act of this film, which felt a little rushed in many regards, but the rest of the film was definitely compelling with a solid story to tell and a very talented cast to help tell it!"

I am not the audience for it and I realised that only after watching it. There's no other way, besides, I like Kate Beckinsale a lot and don't want to miss it out. I like periodic drama, those colorful costumes, horse riding, proper English and the culture, all of them very interests me. Particularly Jane Austen's work, I don't think anybody would miss it if they know her masterworks.

But my issue was the presentation. It looked a lot like a stage drama than a motion picture, anyway all the Jane Austen work is like that only. I'm not doubting the actors, in fact, not just my beauty queen Kate Beckinsale, all of them were good. Also thought the story was good which I felt kind of similar to 'Emma' by the same author, yet I'm disappointed with the way it was narrated for the screen.

I know some people liked it, and my choice of words may annoy them, but I don't want to offend them or the film, just wanted to say what I felt, that's all. My bad luck, the film was not what I wanted. Slow film, but the length was good enough to forget any lags in the pace. Other than one thing what I said bothered me the most, this is a nice film, definitely not bad to watch it once. I said that believing you might be different than me. So that is an indirect suggest, but if you are another me, I'll favour you to skip it. Anyway, many would watch it by the time go on and going give their's the good, the bad and the ugly opinions and nobody can stop it.

Whilst the screenplay is very literate and not without its moments of humour, the barrage of verbiage finally adds up to little in the way of real drama. The cast give it their all and Kate Beckinsale is suitably conniving and manipulative as Lady Susan. Ultimately, though, it remains a resolutely small and unambitious chamber piece. The high production values that helped elevate both ‘Emma’ and ‘Sense and Sensibility’ are sorely missing here, even if the costumes on display are beautiful in themselves. Love and Friendship is finally and fatally undone by its lack of dramatic incident."

Although it's set in the lovely 18th century locales of the author's other tales, the central character (Kate Beckinsale) is unlike her typical heroines. She's a selfish, dishonest, scheming widow who manipulates everyone around her to find husbands for herself and her daughter. Although Beckinsale is lovely, she doesn't possess the charismatic qualities that could have made the character compelling. She dominates the dialogue and there's lots of it…not much of it as clever as needed. The only memorable character (Sir James Martin) is played with delightful dizziness by Tom Bennett. The surprisingly colorful costumes are exquisite and there is a lively pace that keeps the film afloat. It may look like a typical Austen flick, but lacks the elegant charm and romantic appeal we've come to expect from the genre."

While I appreciate its last 20 minutes, unfortunately, the final scene ruins the atmosphere of the entire film. It is highly likely that the audience, accustomed to Hollywood horrors, may appreciate the movie for its openness to novelty. It is not a familiar style. Apart from the characters' dark sides and the concept of the world behind the occasionally attempted eerie curtain, the film falls far below my expectations. It may be a good film in a year like 2018, which experienced a shortage of horror films.

And there was the unsettlingly weird look of newcomer Milly Shapiro who I thought was the little girl in ""Les Miserables"" but no. This film was more a study of the descent into madness/psychosis that was colored with horror. It wasn't a horror genre film like Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc. But because it's a story about madness some of the scenes are difficult to understand and to determine if they're ""real"" or part of the character's madness. I'm a dude and not easily scared or intimidated so this film rather than scaring me was just more unsettling and disturbing, it left me in a bad mood, especially with the very odd, weird, again unsettling final scene.

So when people were cumming themselves left and right about this movie, I naturally had to see what was up.

Here's the deal: If you're looking for an equally fun and innovative (because, hey- it's gotten GREAT reviews) thrill ride of a horror flick along the lines of the classics and/or new classics, THIS IS NOT IT. If, instead, you're looking for a severely f-ed up, enjoyment-depleting, WTF-inducing nightmare, knock yourself out. Just promise me you won't have kids.

However, as notedd by many people, this film is rather cliche by the end and if you've seen Rosemary's Baby, you've bascially seen this film and its logical conclusion. At worst, Ari Aster is just borrowing from a variety of great horror films and trying to mash it into a messy plot that just doesn't add up.

Aside from some superb acting with the cast, and an eerily soundtrack which is akin to some of the haunting sounds by Johnny Greenwood, the film is borderline meandering and the characters never built up enough relationship for the audience to actually care about their peril. In fact, the majority of characters spend so much time outside their house and in daylight that you almost forget this is a horror film. It's a shame because I loved the Witch, the Babadook and It follows (and also It comes at night), but this was the one where I felt the film didn't serve its story and theme.

It does a good job reminding you of The Exorcist and Rosemary’s Baby, yet I also couldn’t help but be reminded of The Babadook and The Witch. These are just two examples of films the critics did not shut up about for months. I went to see both due to the hype and was left disappointed. Hereditary comes along promising much of the same, I can’t help but get caught up in the hype. I’ve heard the hysteria, I’m prepared, I settle down ready to be terrified and instead I was bored and waiting for the credits to roll so I could finally leave. Oh sure they can compare it to The Exorcist and Rosemary’s Baby all they like, put it on all the posters if you want but it doesn’t make it The Exorcist or Rosemary’s Baby. Maybe I missed something, but for me Hereditary was only mildly better than your average horror movie.

After the death of her mother, Annie (Toni Collette) and her family begin to unravel cryptic and increasingly terrifying secrets about their ancestry. Despite a promising start Hereditary falls into the trap about half way through where it completely lost me, the plot became ridiculous and instead of getting scared I was losing interest. The first half was filled to the brim with atmosphere, so tense and gripping I thought we were on to a winner here. Hereditary puts the effort in to build the tension and create a foreboding atmosphere. Wonderfully shot, the cinematography is simply amazing. Many of the scenes give the sensation of looking at a miniature view of the set, an impressive amount of attention to detail, such a shame the rest of the film didn’t live up to this standard. It’s got some shocking scenes that will disturb you alright, and will no doubt stay in your mind well after the film has ended. Toni Collette is excellent. Her performance is carrying the film, yet the plot doesn’t offer much else, the hammy acting throws you out of the suspenseful horror movie and into over the top and generally trying to suss out whether it’s okay to laugh or not. I wasn’t the only one trying to stifle laughter on more than one occasion and I’m sure I won’t be the last. First time director Ari Aster hasn’t exactly given us a flop, it’s well directed for one thing and I hope his next film works out a little better.

You all know I love horror films so you can believe me when I say Hereditary does not live up to the hype it promises. You’ve seen similar ideas done before only better. Not recommended unless you just love seeing some disturbing cinema in that case enjoy. And don’t forget to scare your fellow movie goers with a tongue click AFTER the film has ended, NOT during a quiet and suspenseful moment."

Or perhaps Hereditary is 'art-house horror' - for people who can't stomach films as disturbing as The Descent or as discomforting as The Witch. The ending was the most disappointing thing about Hereditary, after an ultra slow-burn build-up that hinted at a terrifying conclusion, instead we were given a curious sort of 1970s gothic horror-lite scene that managed to be somehow completely unshocking despite the presence of kneeling headless corpses. I couldn't recommend Hereditary to anyone, unless you are a film school student interested more in style than substance, or unless you can only stand moderate scares. And forget what the posters say, this isn't in the same league as The Exorcist."

While there are interesting aspects strewn throughout with some intriguing grim subject matter, it meanders into a very dark disjointed story that goes into a very depressingly stupid realm much like 2016's The Witch. If A24 didn't constantly scam people advertising this as a full on horror film with a decent trailer with some horror cliche visuals, and then release a dragged on dark drama, maybe people wouldn't be outraged at them.

Today, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse accurately depicts more than just that: what it means to put on the red mask.

It’s no secret, however, that superheroes give bad relationship advice, as Mary Jane Watson has always been so awful to Peter. Here, while there’s also a usual mentor relationship for Brooklyn teen Miles, things really get kicked off by his affection for Gwen Stacy, who mostly stands as a believable yet cheap love interest. She does get to become more of a character later, but the way she’s introduced isn’t enough to hook female viewers. Spider-Man is essentially worshipped as a god for everyone to submit their identities to, but this movie also tries to make us feel sad for the “humanized” villain, Kingpin, by giving him a forgettable tragic backstory. Any sadness attempted falls flat because it’s brought up using a noisy, hyper, seizure-inducing color spectrum; the worst possible method of entertaining kids.

We perhaps are getting a taste of the dark cinematic superhero era of 1995, back when its insincere cheesiness peaked by a certain director whose name rhymes with Moel Bumacher. Although in this case, it works to its advantage, as some anime influence pops up by the visual of a spider on ultraviolet hallucinogens. Other old comic book imagery makes its way in, like yellow box text projecting Miles’ thoughts. There are plenty other creative spins to make this its own distinct identity, one that sprays graffiti paint over your own eyesight of Ben Parker’s “great power, great responsibility” quote. Miles’ extra-dimensional mentor, Mister Peter B. Parker, now hates Uncle Ben’s quote, so a new uncle figure (and aunt figure) arrive for a new 2018 audience. Such new changes to the formula help deliver an important new message to learn: You can’t save everybody.

Regrettably, the screenwriters, which include Phil Lord of The LEGO Movie, couldn’t save their script. I know superhero worlds often embrace absurdity, except the logic of this superhero world matches a child’s mind, its coincidences removing justification of the ridiculous dialogue, particularly Miles’ incapacity to tell his dad he loves him. Also, Spider-Man comics exist within Miles’ world… for some unexplained reason. The poor writing goes to the unconvincing dialogue ruined all the further by overly dramatic music queueing in a surprise villain twist. These detriments to Miles’ character arc spark the numerous bad qualities of old comic books.

That doesn’t mean the good visual qualities of old comic books are useless, quite the opposite in fact. As a response to his police officer father forcing him to attend “Visions Academy,” Miles appears to imagine the entire world as a comic book. Little “peck-peck-pecks” pop out of several pigeons in a sense of comic book cheesiness done correctly. While a retro battle against a giant Green Goblin takes on an old classic feel, a snow-ridden grave under flowers suggest influence from modern graphic novels. These moments all come together with a constant implementation of little vinyl dots across the screen to match an old comic strip on newsprint. Those little details balance the harshness of the past and harshness of the present, like cartoons birthing a “millenialized” baby boomer society to redefine heroism.

Its satire of the Raimi trilogy comes full circle to be not just funny, but insightful, in what needs to change. To complete revisionist touches of the superhero icon’s maturation for our modern lens, the women get their chance to suit up, particularly Gwen Stacy and her accidentally awesome haircut; not to mention Doc Ock is now female! That means we ALL get a chance to be Spider-Man!

Now, how am I Spider-Man? For one, the many difficulties come at times when helpful people aren’t always around. Example: Several months ago, I lost my wallet at the grocery story, so then began the recovery process by ordering a replacement driver’s license… which arrived a mere days before I found my wallet in the pantry. It’s a stupid moment of unnecessary freaking out, but sums up what 2018 was all about for me: becoming 100% financially dependent on myself in the same process of self-discovery and self-help that Peter Parker went through when he needed to become Spider-Man.

And finally, I ought to point out how this movie tributes Stan Lee. Amid his recent death, Stan’s latest cameo gives the man great respect that would guarantee tears of joy."

The Shape of Water dons many hats, several at the same time, which distract and compete for attention: that central relationship, the military's plans for the creature, a neighbor's quest to reclaim his job with an ad agency, a coworker's marriage, a supervisor's frustrated home life. Each adds a layer to the onion skin, and color to the world, but ultimately they feel like light diversions from the main course.

On a technical level, it's exceptional. Guillermo del Toro's work has never been short on conceptual know-how, and The Shape of Water merely continues his habit of one-upping the preceding film. The beast itself, heavily influenced by The Creature from the Black Lagoon with a hint or two of Abe Sapien from del Toro's Hellboy, looks fantastic. Lifelike and expressive, it's easy to buy into as a thinking, feeling participant in the story. Sally Hawkins is equally wonderful as the human lead, drawing inspiration from dozens of classic silent films in her flourishing role as a mousey, passionate, eloquent young woman. Set designs, too, are distinct and remarkable, from the slimy, clinical confines of the military science lab to her crusty, crumbling apartment right above a busy movie theater.

The plot drags, though, and more than once edges awfully close to cliché. I enjoyed it, particularly on a thematic level, but I wish it was about twenty minutes shorter."

The film explores themes of love, acceptance, trust and inclusivity, but the romance between Elisa and Amphibian Man is rushed and feels flat.

A medida que Elisa y la criatura, llamada Hombre Anfibio, desarrollan un estrecho vínculo, deben sortear las presiones para eliminar a la criatura tanto del gobierno de EE.

La película explora temas de amor, aceptación, confianza e inclusión, pero el romance entre Elisa y el Hombre Anfibio es apresurado y se siente aburrido. La película cuenta con las características visuales y el estilo estilístico característicos de Del Toro, con una cálida atmósfera vintage e impresionantes escenas submarinas.

Guillermo Del Toro obviously despises everything that has to do with traditional values, and made a movie about it. The only three-dimensional characters are the outcasts, the misfits; everyone else is evil, sanctimonius and plain stupid. I don't think this is what the USA in the 60s really were like, even though I have no way of knowing for sure, I see it more as a caricature, a summary of what was wrong cranked up to 11.
The movie suffers for it. The antagonist is despicable in every possible way, and this is especially a pity becasue I've always loved Del Toro's magnetic villains. Not just the superb, sad and poetic prince Nuada, after all that was a fantasy movie, but even the Francoist Colonel in Pan's Labyrinth was evil to the core - but also fearless and tougher than nails. The villain in this movie is not only evil, but also weak, clueless, stupid and ridiculed even in the way he pisses!
It's the caricature of a villain in a caricature of the USA, for a caricature of a Del Toro movie: unfortunately the director let his sensibilities get the better of his judgement. Definitely not worth a ""Best Film"" Oscar, IMHO."

Guillermo del Toro has earned, thanks to beautiful films written and directed by him, popularity and a kind of veneration that doesn’t make easy to say that one of his films didn’t like with the risk of being attacked by a horde of zombie fans but I don’t care.
Photography, set design, costumes, all perfect, but what doesn’t work?
The story! One of the most trivial stories I could see, and I'm sorry that it was written by one of the directors I admired most (after I saw crimson peak).
As for “Phantom Thread”, the historical period in which the film is set (in this case the Cold War) serves only as a background to tell about  characters that, despite a fantastic story, live our current problems.
There's the rub.
The characters are all great caricatures, created specifically for tear, smile and prizes.
There’s the protagonist that in a petty world, full of prejudices (like today), she cannot deal with anyone except with people on the margins of society like her., and the only relief valve that  she has is ****, until she meet the monster; the gay painter out of time in everything he does; the black woman victim of everyone but who finally manages to rebel; the monster: something unknown, therefore an object, useful only for scientific study that can be applied in any way; the bad American agent who would do anything to get a promotion; the Russian scientist who, as he believes in science, is good; the bad Russians of course; the bad and bigoted American society.
And I want to ignore the obvious forcing in the script that I want to consider poetic licenses such as: the bad guy with the gangrenous hand standing like the predator, or the bathroom that fills with water without any problem, or the fact that it is very easy to enter in a classified place.
I should, as already said, let go many things concerning the script, but when I see characters written in this way my gears grinds.
I sincerely hope that despite this success Del Toro won’t touch ""At the Mountains of Madness"".
P.S. The monster. People said that it is a God. But what exactly does it do to look smarter (even if it takes less) than all the characters in the film?"

Ham-fisted messages of treating the unknown with respect, while noble in theory, are really a thinly veiled excuse for del Toro to showcase his (admittedly innocuous) fish porn fantasies.

Now. MY GOD! This movie is stupid ON PURPOSE. Because its a fantasy they get to create a world were everything is a charicature, and if this wins an Oscar, then exactly why not a comic book movie like Logan? Oscars **** (I knew it, but this movie just confirmed it).

This sea-man is in the clutches of a sadistic military security officer who wants to kill and dissect him.  So the maid decides she needs to try to rescue this being.  Del Toro portrays the early 1960s as a time of oppressive conformity, cold war, homophobia et cetera, and the story becomes a very obvious parable about the struggles of those who are different from the norm.

A sometimes interesting very visual journey that tells a very familiar story to a high standard. Like a lot of del toro works it suffers from feeling a little too much like watching events take place inside a comic book frame rather than a realistic location.

By the time I'd walked into this film, my expectations were high. Not only was I already excited to see a new Del Toro film, being a somewhat ""fan"" of much of his work, the movie had also garnered a lot of hype and praise. Now that the film is in my rearview mirror and steadily fading farther back, I can safely give my review.
While visually stunning and well acted, The Shape of Water came off as Abe Sapien playing The Creature from the Black Lagoon. There is no new tale to tell here. There is no fresh look at story telling. The Beauty and the Beast is over 200 years old, and there are any number of incarnations of it. And while the characters are well developed, each having their own quirks, they are poorly used support an unfortunately simple plot.
I'd wanted so much more from this film, such as a pace suitable for the plot drivers and a memorable scene or two just as Pan's Labyrinth had (which continues to call itself as a comparable film for Del Toro for me). Sadly I got neither. There were certainly moments, but no scene really stood out as a pinnacle force.
As it stands, The Shape of Water is good. Not great, just good. I'll simply have to wait for another art-house movie from Guillermo to be released and hope what will surely be my high expectations aren't dashed."

Digo... consiguió mantenerme atento por dos horas, por lo menos. Pero una vez que terminó y comencé a pensar en lo que acababa de ver, me costaba recordar cosas que NO fueran mediocres. Del Toro tira y tira escenas en la cinta final y muchas de ellas no sirven para nada (en general todas las líneas argumentales secundarias son omitibles), y además se enfrasca en convenir un mensaje social que es demasiado indiscreto como para dejar pensando al espectador por sí mismo. El último acto es casi en su totalidad baratija hollywoodense: si tu trama requiere que todos lo personajes actúen como idiotas para que tu final tenga la más mínima gracia, entonces algo mal estás haciendo. Las líneas finales son cursilería digna de telenovela para adelescentes. Ignoren todo eso."

Visually it is typical Del Toro.  It is engaging and charming.  Clever use of framing, setting, even costumes shows a keen eye and clear grasp of his craft.  This is among his best visually.

Pacing is off, but typical of his work.  If you know Del Toro, you come to expect it and just cope.  If you are not familiar, his second act is always a the weak part of his films.  Don't expect a lot here and you won't be disappointed.

Audio is complimentary, without distraction, though it is also not helping to drive it either.  It is overall 'meh', but also not unusual for Del Toro.  If you know him, this will also not phase you.  Most others will not even notice.

Character development is not overly deep.  The main couple is somewhat deep, but the antagonist is simply a parody.  Normally the antagonists have depth and you find some level of sympathy with them, but not here.  This is just a mockery, but one that is disconcerting as it mocks everything one should hold dear.  I can't get into it without spoilers, but this is the most problematic part of this film.

Combined with the overall narrative, this is where the movie falls apart.  How it could even be nominated for an Oscar is beyond me.  If you have seen Hellboy, you are going to be overly familiar with the whole movie.  If you aren't, don't worry because the foreshadowing is so clear that it smacks you in the face and calls you a loser.  This is by far the worst story I've seen in some time.  The fact that Del Toro wrote this just highlights the trend of directors shouldn't write their movies.  From George Lucas to this, great writers will generally never make great directors, and vice versa.  Somehow this D list horror/comedy movie in the vein of of ""Saturday the 14th"" and ""Love at First Bite"" is getting an Oscar nod just highlights how the industry has fallen."

The script, at first is too slow and takes time to establish the main plot, but at the end (in the last 15 minutes) everything is solved fast and forced.

Of course, I'm no expert, but I trust in my good taste in story telling. As some people commented, finding things just for the sake to be original isn't really necessary to effectively tell a good story. This romantic version of ""Free Willy"" is just an example. Just to start, both the protagonist and the sidekick are an utter pain. They barely had any dimension, how are we as spectators supposed to feel invested in their goals like that? How can we root for them? The pacing is awkward and unnecessarily long. A lot of things are just there for plot convenience. Subplots are thrown into the mix only to be forgotten immediately without any consequence. Even with Alexandre Desplat, the music is forgetable. The ending is abrupt and we are left with a lot of stuff still hanging.

Of course, there's good stuff in the movie too. The acting was good (although a little unrealistic at times), Octavia's and Michael characters were enjoyable and the main plot (when we got that on screen) was on point and that's why this movie is just average to me. It does really good in one side, but what it does wrong, it does it really wrong (sometimes cringe worthy).

If you have an open mind and you just want to watch something without thinking about it too much and just drift with it, go ahead and give it a go. With any luck, you'll enjoy it or even like it. I tried and it was definitely an experience.

It has been nominated for Golden Globe in 7 categories and expected to win it's main prize. No doubt that it will be in the Oscar's list as well.

The movie is listed as a mixture of 5 different genres but I would describe it as a pseudo-realistic fairy tale for adults.

It is a love story between a mute woman who cleans a high-security government institution and a semi-human, semi-amphibian creature that US Army caught in an ocean for research.

This artsy film recreates an atmosphere of Cold-War-era America with enchanting visuals and music and it is pleasant to watch most of the time.
So I understand why so many people praise it. On the other hand, in my opinion, the hype is not justified. The movie is not targeted to children. Yet all characters are caricaturish: either all-out villains or all-out do-gooders.

There are many annoying details that scream of poor directing. And don't even get me started about cliches: you can hardly find one that is missing here.

There are three superb actors that have almost nothing to play due to a primitive script. But they still manage to impress.

Although Mr. del Toro may have had a strong message to deliver, this cold war version of the lighter film “Splash” (with Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah)  doesn’t communicate it well. I found it difficult for the audience to get lost in it and truly believe what is occurring on the screen.

But the cut here is too clean and the acting too theatrical, the whole film becomes heavy on the eyes after a while. Like with Berberian Sound Studio, the intentions are all good, it's the realisation that lacks vigour and will, for some people, result in instant boredom. In other words, it's impossible to watch The Duke of Burgundy without being carefully and tightly pointed in the direction that screams at you: ""Look how artsy this is. Look how shot composition is handled. Look how good we look.""  Rather than letting the viewer arrive at this conclusion on their own, the movie is much too keen to lead you to it. Besides, some of the weirdness here (like the temporal setting, or the thing with the butterflies) is unjustified and adds nothing to the viewing experience.

I would much rather see The Duke of Burgundy as a play, in a theatre: it's its natural environment, where acting like this really pays off, and you can be as lengthy and as reflective as you wish. As a film, it doesn't give much of a reason to keep watching it.

They say its a prequel to the 1996 film 'My Sex Life' that I haven't seen, but this looked good and its not. I'm not sure how much one has to be familiar with the original film, though it does not matter much I think since it is a prequel. Because everything starts here and follows there. So I saw it, and I wanted to like it, but not fully impressed. The story was told in chapters. The opening was like some kind of a spy thriller, but soon when the episode 'Esther' begins, it turned into a romance drama.

A man who has been investigated when another person with the same identity was found. So he reveals his school day's events, followed by his first girlfriend and complication surrounding it he had faced. That, how he had won her over the older boys and about his close friend, till leaving them behind to work in the central Asia. Mostly it is a love story with some twists in the affair, but how it all ends still remains mystery even after the narration ended.

The issue is it is not detailing anything, just reveals events of a youngster's romance life. Particularly the end was not good. So I think that's why I need to see the first film, resuming the narration could continue from where this one concluded. I leave (_b_l_a_n_k__s_p_a_c_e_) till I saw that and update this review, if I change my stance over this one. Even if I didn't like, still I would update it.

Meanwhile back to the review; it is like a French version of 'Flashbacks of a Fool'. Technically, there's no fault in this, only the screenplay did not convince me. The actors were so good, no doubt its a well made film that some people would enjoy it and I hope you are one of those.

''Room'' is a very special movie, a one of its kind really, the story was original, the acting was one of the years very best, but it missed a dramatic flair and some scenes dragged on for too long and a noticeable off balanced structure of acts.
Room may be an annoying film for some (including me for some parts) thanks to its impressive and original initial premise and frustrating because of all the missed opportunities.
However the chemistry and love/hate relationship between ''Ma'' and Jack is impeccable and a feast to look at.

Room has great potential, but soon in the movie it decides to leave behind all the possibilities/potential for a more solid and overwhelming drama, which is good but could've been great.

Overall ''Room'' is a very good film, but not flawless and ''the best in years'' like many people are claiming it to be."
1528,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/room-2015/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,MattBrady99,"Feb 27, 2016",6,"Ma: ""You're gonna love it"".

Jack: ""What?"".

Ma: ""The world"".

Room tells the story of a relationship between a mother and son, as she raises him while confined to a 10x10 room and what happens when they finally get out.

Since the 2016 Oscars are on Sunday and I've been lacking quite a bit on seeing as many Oscar contenders from last year. Room was one of those movies, as I've heard nothing but great things about it and how truly unique it is (from what I heard). It was a real shame that I had to wait for a while to get a chance to watch this movie, because it's been a very slow month over here in jolly good England. But after finally seeing the movie after that long wait, I can say that the movie was pretty underwhelming, and that's really disappointing saying that.

Brie Larson has been sweeping the award season this year, by taking home: The BAFTA, Golden Globe, Critics Choice award and the SAG award, and it's very deserving. Brie Larson delivered a tremendous performance and she was without a doubt the best part of this movie. I'm so happy that Larson is finally getting noticed since everyone pretty much forgot about ""Short Term 12"" and her performance in that film that got very unnoticed. Larson shows off her acting skills in this movie and I know for a fact that she will receive an Oscar on Sunday night. She was truly brilliant in this movie and one of her best performance so far.

Lenny Abrahamson (director of the movie) brought us the 2014 film ""Frank"", which I really liked and I couldn't wait to see want he will bring to this movie, and what he brought was somewhat of a mix bag for me. I'm happy for him to get an Oscar nomination, but I didn't find anything that special or groundbreaking when it came to it's directing. Most of it is just copy and past from the book that this movie is based on, so Abrahamson can look on what he's doing. I didn't read the book (and never will) but I've heard a lot of people who did read the book say that the book is better than the movie, and even the author herself said the same thing. The directing isn't anything Oscar worthy, but it's decent directing at best for Abrahamson.

The first act of this movie was very strong and it did kept my interest. That's the biggest positive I had for this movie is it's first act.

Jacob Tremblay is an unknown star to me and for everyone else, so this is basically he's break out role. I did look up on what Tremblay has been in before and I found out he was in ""The Smurfs 2"" which wasn't that good. But all that aside, I thought he's performance was alright, nothing outstanding, but nothing terrible. He's better than most kids I've seen in recent movies, but I also have seen better ones as well.

Now for the problems: The second act wasn't as strong as the first act. The movie did lose me a couple of times as I became disinterest as it went along.

The movie did feel like a sugar-coated version of the book and as I said before I haven't even read the book, but for what I heard from other people, the book is more graphic and dark than the movie. I get this question asked a lot when I say the movie sugar-coated from the book, ""Would you rather have graphic scenes of **** from the book"", well if that's what the book is suppose to be, then yeah, and it's not because I want to see someone get ****, but if you what me to give a crap about the characters and their struggle to see how their suffered, then the film makers shouldn't have sugar-coated it. I feel like if this movie was handled by a different director, it would have been a much better movie. The movie is basically telling you that there's violence and **** that happened, but there's nothing really graphic about it. The movie tells you to care about things that it never bothers developing and if you are going to make a movie on a subject like that, and pretend that this horrible thing that happened, again, you shouldn't sugar-coat it. Take ""12 Years a Slave"" as an example: That movie was graphic, brutal, honest and that's what made it an amazing movie, because it took a real life story like slavery that's suppose to make you feel for the character's and makes you look at what their been through and say to yourself ""Wow, that was truly awful"". Now look at Room, we have a single character and the movie is telling you to feel bad for her and what shes been through, but it didn't show any of it, and it's not like it has to be graphic for the sake of it, but it didn't even try to develop it.

Overall Room was very overwhelming and kind of bland. I know a lot of people are going to get mad at me for not loving this movie as they do, but that's just my opinion."
1529,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/room-2015/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Prashun,"Feb 5, 2016",6,"There it is the first movie of the award season which I did not think much of. Don't get me wrong it's a decent but thoroughly average film. The movie starts out promisingly and does a couple of things right, makes no mistakes but does nothing special or extraordinary with the situation. I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt and was hoping the psychological aspects of the film would step up in the second half but it didn't do so, the second half completely changes the situation for worse, there are new problems to deal with and the movie goes about them in it's usual half committed way which was prevalent in first half. The acting is definitely the strong suit of the film, Brie Larson is amazing and I would be ok with her winning the Oscar, though I didn't think much of the film I thought she was great. The kid played by Jacob Tremblay showed amazing depth and variety for a young child. The weakness of the film is direction, it does not capitalizes on it's setting, it has no great scenes and does not visually grab you at anytime (I am not reading a book I am watching a movie), also sometimes Brie Larson's character is quite inconsistent and unrealistic sometimes, she shows very few signs of PTSD, it sometimes feels she was trapped in Room for weeks not seven years, not her fault though, another misstep by the director, along with not capitalizing that Jack maybe better off without Joy (it touches so less on the REAL issues it's infuriating)."
1530,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/room-2015/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,oDjento,"Feb 4, 2016",6,"Room was based on a book that was always going to be up for an Oscar if adapted to screen, but the film didn’t fully hold my attention all the way. The most intriguing and haunting part of the film is the first act within the room. It really nicely builds up the characters and explains their situation nicely along with how they feel about it.
The film is kind of narrated by the distorted view of Jack (who I sweaaaar was a girl) and it is interesting to see how he views things, despite his rather irritating but annoyingly understandable tantrums – I couldn’t emapthise with them because I can’t see it from his point of view but I totally understood why he had them which messed me up a little.
The film is flowing nicely whist in this room and is shot claustrophobically but also in a way that makes the room seem larger than it is (possibly to adumbrate the girls view of the room whilst only having been living in it alone) and this is a unique directing technique. I applaud this first half. However, as soon as the second half rolls onto the screen it loses its touch and becomes a unwarrantedly at times pessimistic story that has predictable story elements and characters that lose focus. The traumas of the outside world feel vapid and flat compared to the ones of the room, and therefore the film loses its focus.
Nevertheless Brie Larson brings a good performance but not as deserving of an Oscar as other nominees, she basically knows when to cry, when to shout and when to be nice and despite doing these well lacks any sort of originality to her role especially in this original kind of script. This does not mean she is bad, just possibly a little over praised that’s all, I did enjoy her role.
The child is does a great job especially considering he is a child actor.
A unique and for the first half emotionally exhausting film, but saunters and permeates too much in the second and thereby loses focus. Not as strong as his previous film.
6.5/10
P.S. I would’ve really liked a Tommy Wiseau cameo or “The Room” mention in the film. Not appropriate? Probably not bearing in mind the subject matter of the film but still, would’ve made my day."

This is a pure drama. Like a real life event, though there's no documentary style narration influenced. Thematically very, very simple, and also the characters, but too flat when it comes to entertainment value. Of course, drama-films usually does not entertain its viewers, except for who are ardent fans of that genre. Apart from depicting the real life, sometimes they carry messages with them. But this film has no tick marks on any of those boxes. So it is a boring film if you pick it to watch when you're on the average or in the bad mood. I did not feel that way, just hinting out it could do that for others.

The storyline had no focal point. It is neither a children's film, nor about the grownups' issues. But kind of mix of both on a small scale with strong outcome. Pretty much like on the two topics it was developed on. One was the 'death' which initiated everything and followed by the 'shop' that helped to make further progress in the tale. So using these, the film characters bloomed. Even though, these topics come into play occasionally and in the meantime, the scenes were wasted or you can say it followed the character to their daily routine to fill the film runtime.

So what's that mean is the screenplay, which was not at its best. It does not follow the traditional film way on the character developments. Like I expected the friendship between two boys like how they find each other as to emerge a strong bond. That did not happen. It was just like I said in the real life, too casual and understandable.

The same goes for the adult characters as well. When they decide to handle the shop issue, it was like hesitation like any average concerned family does. So this film will be good if your life is/was close to the events in the film. Like either it is your friendship that tested or dealing the sensitive issue as a grown-up that affects deeply those concerned ones.

❝Once again, our warm, lovable, unwise father has left us a big mess and no instructions.❞

Now you might think what this film is all about. This is the story of the two families connected with a building. Opens with a small Manhattan family arriving in Brooklyn to conduct the last rite to their deceased father. They are received by another family who rented the shop in the ground floor. Both the family has the young boys of the same age and following the ceremony, the two become very close. But when their parents decide to sort out the shop issue, it's all fall hard on them and their friendship. The remaining is to reveal the outcome of whatever happened.

You might be familiar with the quote that goes like this, 'a friendship founded on business in better than a business founded on friendship'. Basically, that's where the film inspired from. But it expanded to two sets of the characters, between the youngsters and the adults. These two categories are exactly opposite in mindset. Youngsters usually does not care about money that involves friends, but for adults, money is a serious matter to handle. The 'business' is attached to the parents and the 'friendship' drawn between their children.

Now that's the complication involves as many people as to solve without affecting anybody. But most of the film was overwhelmed by scenes of other than this issue. They ignored to focus completely on where it had calibre. I felt the casting was the best thing happened in the film, particularly those boys. Alfred Molina, who played one of the main characters in the director's previous film was appeared here in a guest role for like a minute. The rest of them were decent as well, including Greg Kinnear.

The film was just under the 90 minutes, yet too slow paced narration. Does not fit for everyone to watch. Imagine if this film was played on the television, with all the commercial breaks, you won't able to finish it off. Not without patience, because it is already dull, and if you will run out that, that's it. A lot like a product for the film festivals and it did fared decently on those platforms, but surely some people would find it good. So now you might think what my stance is. I liked it, also didn't. An average film with a slipped away opportunity. I am not sure, but still feel like I want to suggest it.

1539,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/little-men/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Spangle,"Jan 20, 2017",6,"Little Men is a solid film from director Ira Sachs. A film about the friendship between two boys and how it becomes fractured due to a business dispute between their parents, the film feels real. At every turn, it feels like real life. These are real people and get authentic performances from good, down to earth actors. That said, Little Men is hardly perfect. Though it really captures the look and feel of Brooklyn and the surrounding community, in addition to its characters, it just feels so slight. It covers the topics of young male friendship, immaturity, and lack of understanding between parents and children, but it never does it in an acceptable depth. The film sort of appears, touches on these topics, and then disappears because it is far too short. That said, it does have moments of real resonance that stand out and make this a more than worthwhile experience.

Little Men introduces us to Tony Calvelli (Michael Barbieri) and Jake Jardine (Theo Taplitz). Following the death of Jake's grandfather, he and his parents move into his Brooklyn apartment and now own the store space below the apartment. Currently, the store is owned by Tony's mother, Leonor (Paulina Garcia). Unfortunately, she has been paying very little due to a favorable relationship with Brian Jardine's (Greg Kinnear) now deceased father. As Brian is a failing actor and his wife is the sole breadwinner for the family, he desperately needs to raise the lease amount. His sister also is pressuring him to do so, leading to friction with Leonor. This friction gets to the kids who, in an act of unity, refuse to talk to their parents. Yet, despite everyone's best intentions, the families are tragically driven apart.

It is in this relationship between the families that the film really soars. A lack of communication permeates this film and is what really drives them apart. People avoid confrontation or simply use muteness as a sign of disagreement. This really only exacerbates their problems, as little Jake soon realizes. In an emotional moment of the film, he has an outburst in front of everybody and apologizes to his dad for not talking to him and begs to understand why they are doing this to the Calvelli's. This outburst highlights the importance of communication (sometimes too much of it) and how it has led to the crumbling of relations between these two, once close, families.  On this note, however, the observations feel relatively mundane and overly slight. It never dives into them enough and what really makes these people tick. It adds elements - such as Jake likely being gay - to add depth to the characters and add to the realism, but much of it never really impacts the film or the characters in any meaningful way. While that is fine, it would have been nice if it had added to the themes explored in the film or even the overall disintegration of the relationships in the film.

That said, the friendship in the film between Jake and Tony is terrific. Willing to defend each other no matter what, the fast friends are solidly acted by the young actors. They can be loose around one another and express their hopes and dreams, without fear of judgment. They encourage one another from the start and can simply pal around and do whatever. Really a tenderly written friendship, this element of the film is one of the best parts of Little Men and why it deserves the acclaim it has received for the most part. Not too many films create such a delicate and tender look at teenage male friendships, yet this one does and its authenticity is astounding.

The film also introduces an important theme of masculinity. Brian Jardine is not really a man in the eyes of people like Leonor. Her husband is off in Africa being a nurse and she also views this as not manly enough, as he clearly does not provide. Yet, she really looks down on Brian, even telling him that his father thought the same and told her as much. Since Brian is a struggling actor, his psychotherapist wife is the breadwinner and pays for everything they own. Though Brian and his wife Kathy (Jennifer Ehle) are fine with the arrangement, the reversal of gender roles is  a tough issue for many to accept and even Brian struggles. You can see that there is something within him that is bothered by this arrangement and a conversation with Leonor really brings it to light. Unfortunately, like many other things in the film, it is introduced and then taken away far too soon.

Little Men is an incredibly slight film. It is too short for the amount of themes it wants to and it approaches those themes tepidly. While it is well acted, the film simply never really does nearly enough with its characters or its themes to be anything more than an above average film with the potential to be better. That said, as a business major, I do appreciate that Sachs took care to not demonize the Jardine family for kicking out Leonor and her business. It is a business decision, pure and simple. I would evict her too."

Have always been a fan of Greg Kinnear I also thought he done a decent job of playing the father.

There were so many avenues it could have expanded upon including the relationship between the boys, the grandfathers death, their friends at school, the father's lack of a real job and support, and the list goes on.

Motives for the robbery are far from being crystal clear. Were they just bored and wanted to do something of significance?
Did they just want to get rich? Or maybe they wanted to get somehow attached to the ancestors' history by stealing sacred artifacts? And what is ""stealing"" after all?
Mexican government took it from the Indians and placed into the National Museum - isn't it a theft in itself?

It would be hard not to feel sorry for him. Its a somewhat thought provoking watch - perhaps a bit cliched but not a bad watch overall, although not an entirely memorable one in the long run. Also, I thought that Ray Romano did particularly well, playing the more laidback and considerate parental figure, Terry. I liked that its based on a true story."

If that's the case, Kumail Nanjiani is a really terrible person.  He constantly lies to everyone in his life.

Let's be honest, regardless of the culture clash, the film does not bring anything new to the table, the plot is very simple and you realize all its courses incredibly fast, even the ending is quite predictable.

I applaud Kumail Nanjiani's work because he's who practically carries the full weight of the film, although Holly Hunter and Ray Romano also have well interventions.

Zoe Kazan does not show anything that has not been seen in her before, especially because her character is very similar to what she did in What If?, regardless of the plot line of her illness, she does not demands nothing from herself as an actress. not even for a second.

First of all, everything about it reeks of its producer Judd Apatow. And while I usually like Apatow’s films, his approach doesn’t work with this subject matter. In addition, Nanjiani’s cerebral brand of humor gets dumbed down. But what bothers me above all is the fact that while the film pretends to be in part about “tolerance” and the way Nanjiani’s character strikes up a relationship with his comatose white girlfriend’s parents  (and thus with middle-class white America at large), this is rendered possible only by the fact that his character renounces EVERYTHING about his Pakistani origins. The film’s message seems to be: white Christian Americans can sympathize with Muslims and /or south Asian or middle Eastern types , but only if the latter reject everything about their own culture in order to assimilate completely to ours. This is an empty sort of “tolerance” that allows for no compromise. The Big Sick lets middle class white Americans feel good about their “tolerance” while in reality not asking them to expand their imaginations at all. And I say this as a middle-class white American myself."

Luckily the plot was stolen by Ray Romano and Holly Hunter (was the Romano-Hunter dialogue better or were they just better comic actors?), but when they were not on screen, things dragged. The coma went on much too long until it was suddenly over.  For me the biggest disappointment was the clichéd way in which the Pakistani-American family was treated where some insight would have been greatly appreciated and a public service. And why is this film called a romance when the love interest spent most of the film off-screen? Plus the hero seemed more charmed by her parents than the girlfriend.

Schrader’s direction is slow but stylish or maybe he left a lot of the creative, visual decisions, to his director of photography: Alexander Dynan (Dog Eat Dog).  But, good looking images and performances do not atone for a clumsily developed script. The first half seemed as if it could be moving into interesting territory - before it trailed off into the now predictable ground that’s getting high ‘praise’ of late. Those who regard themselves as better than the majority of movie viewers might think this is rather arty, and see themselves among the few  smart enough to ‘interpret’ what is really going on. To these I say, it’s very easy to read into any story what you want to see.

Overall, this comes across as little more than ‘topical’ propaganda with a heavy-handed climate change cliché being substituted for any real character study or true depth.  Take the character representing the energy companies executive - as expected; he’s portrayed as the typical insensitive, aggressive bully - buying votes and support from everyone including the church officials that our local pastor (Ethan Hawk) works for.  Hawk is very good in his role but his character's actions become quickly unhinged and downright foolish - right up to the somewhat laughable ending (some viewers asked, “What happened, did the film break”?  This somewhat uninspired work uses scripture based interpretations to manipulate the un-informed, and hook the lazy viewer towards its skewed viewpoints. Could it be that Mr Schrader may need to consider an overdue retirement? – his current writings seem all about recycling character elements of his earlier stories – this one is simply ‘Taxi Driver’ in a church setting, and somewhat poorly transposed at that.

The Academy and the likes of the Scorsese’s of this ‘darkness obsessed’ movie world - may see greatness in these often shambolic works but from the looks of the ticket-buying public, they, are not buying these ideas – so, according to box office returns many of these movies are actually more likely to end up lingering on the shelves.  After jotting out these remarks, I curiously checked for other viewer reviews and found some of interest on IMDb, I could agree with many including the following:  Sandman, PotassiumMan, and Davegipson, etc, on the first and second pages of viewer reviews ... those, and many more are all worth a read to learn more.

One of the better bits, the marvellous singing voice of Julie Murney performing the old Hoffman/Showalter: ‘Leaning On The Everlasting Arms’ – though, it’s almost wasted here.  On the technical side, why would any modern moviemaker want to go backwards? We progressed to the marvellous Wide Screen visual ratio of 16: 9 over a decade ago but Schrader chose to make this movie in 4: 3 (the old standard screen) For this films content, that decision comes across as being as foolish as elements of the story, disappointing indeed (I note some others have said they half expected to see Al Gore’s name on the producer's credits, I understand what they mean!)"

First, it's paced with many pauses, long scenes of somber dialogue and mostly static camera. Second, the blending of religion and environmental discussion left me flat. Hawke is in almost every scene as the pastor of a small Dutch Reform church. He starts out writing a journal and spends much of the film's narrative reading from it. The inevitable climax was telegraphed pretty early on, but watching its development was only mildly interesting. This is hailed as a return to form for writer/director Paul Schrader and it does take an unusual premise and develop it with intelligence.

1583,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/baby-driver/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,arrivist,"Aug 16, 2020",5,"After being booted-off of Ant-Man, Edgar Wright put his energy into (what I imagine he considers to be his own Barry Lyndon), Baby Driver. Wright wanted to make a super-cool film like Drive or Widows, except Edgar Wright isn't cool – he's a massive nerd. Which is fine, and it worked well for  Scott Pilgrim vs the World, where you can embrace the finely choreographed action scenes, and laugh/cringe along with the rest of it.
Baby Driver starts out like a tightly-choreographed modern-day musical, but soon devolves into a fairly generic action film. The soundtrack, blared at full-volume is interspersed with frustrating  whispered, mumbled, dialogue, which often feels like it's being read off the page, with exception of Lily James who brings a bit more emotional depth than the rest of the cast, who seem out of it.
There are a decent 20-minutes at the beginning of the third act where the tension builds. Unfortunately, the film then descends into every other action movie cliché you can imagine.  The jokes aren't funny, but there are some clever set-pieces and flashy editing.  A better concept would have been to focus on the Bonnie & Clyde romance, with protagonist jacking cars and driving to the music which is already playing – which happens once when 'Baby' takes the car from the ATL Twins. For someone who professes to have watched 1000 great films (link omitted per site policy), (yet admits to falling asleep during Tokyo Story), it surprises me how immature and shallow Baby Driver is. I'm sure the film's target audience of teenagers believed it to be a masterpiece when they saw it. I only hope once they grow up, they will roll their eyes  at the thought.  Regardless, Edgar Wright is still a great film-making talent with a unique voice. This film may not have appealed to me, but others loved it. Best of luck to him."

The driving sequences are good, but the inter-personal conflicts are far too contrived. It's a heist movie, it's not hard to come up with good reasons for tension between criminals, and yet Baby Driver bends over backwards to create artificial tension with random thugs picking a fight with Baby even after he's saved their bacon. The movie also leans heavily on a romance that just doesn't really work all that well in my opinion, the girl is hopelessly in love with Baby from their first scene and it doesn't really go anywhere after that. Finally, Baby's over-wrought conscience is a bit hard to square with his actions in the film. We're supposed to see him as a good kid in a bad spot, but he is an accessory to dozens of serious crimes and put civilians in danger constantly.

With so many celebrations of violence killing it at the box office, why do we still wonder how these tragedies continue? Even for myself, the news coverage on a new shooting has become white noise to me, it no longer disturbs me in the appropriate manner. Many other young men love watching stylish massacres, yet supposedly join the public worry about gun violence. From my experience, you can learn a lot about someone based on their taste in movies, so Baby Driver’s wide popularity says a lot about the level of care most young men have about gun violence.

Sure enough, director and writer Edgar Wright (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Shaun of the Dead) attacks the law in his own fueled world void of any justifiable punishment.

First, I want to cover the lack of setting: instead of letting relevant social problems indicate that it takes place in Atlanta Georgia, the stickers on the cop cars alone indicate that. Honestly, if the location was changed to anywhere else in the world, the story remains the same. Rather than a believable city with different people to learn more about, a role-playing clean slate lets you easily imagine yourself in Baby’s position for the town you live in.

Although Edgar Wright, as he’s most famous for, still pulls it off with a modernized narrative style, this time popping in a fluent radio language. In the first scene, the main protagonist, known as Baby, rocks out to his music in a vibrant red car, his lips in sync to the lyrics, ready to drive some bank robbers away from their heist. The absence of real dialogue in the first two scenes puts you into Baby’s 24/7 mentality—he never takes off his earbuds, as he uses the beats of his tunes to fill in the beats of his new criminal lifestyle. So sure enough, the audio style cuts past Baby’s shades to meet him at eye level: the gun fires and windshield wipers match the music beats perfectly. To take you further into Baby’s mental state, you watch him mix his own tunes together while ignoring sudden flashbacks about his rough childhood. He barely even speaks to anybody, as his roommate speaks only in American Sign Language. It keeps you wondering: What goes on between his ears? Here‘s where Debora comes in, the cute waitress he at last opens himself up to in many sweet, informative conversations about music.

Film editors Jonathan Amos and Paul Machliss (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) use appropriate jump cuts alongside the exploitation of circle shapes packed with attitude to transition between scenes. Cinematographer Bill Pope (Clueless, The Matrix) keeps up the excitement with a single uninterrupted shot to show Baby’s strut down the street, which later turns into spinning the camera around the actors throughout their heated conversations. Once the camera acrobatics take a breather for some spicy dialogue, Wright keeps his visual metaphors in mind, like Baby looking at his reflection in self-doubt.

Then once the engine starts up again, each piece of stunt choreography hits you hard with its seamless special effects, turning into a wild third act revved high on octane. Edgar Wright really deserves better directing gigs under a greater studio, he’s sure got the talent!

However, the fantastic technical achievement pale in impact compared to its dreadful lack of redemption toward humanity. If you land outside the male millennial core audience, you may notice the negative stereotypes painted on every roadblock to Baby’s freedom. Alongside the White male supremacy, any named Blacks are either a terrorist or a cripple, nothing positive; in the same way, Asians and Mexicans are seen solely as terrorists. To make it more typical, this screenplay fails the Bechdel Test, giving the sole two significant female roles to gorgeous women who never even make eye contact.

Honestly, if you took away the stylish soundtrack and spicy editing, you got another hollow fantasy populated by shallow archetypes. Baby comes off here as a passive protagonist who expresses no personal fears about the gang members. The same goes to Debora, a submissive device thrown in to be a “get the girl” motivator, and the crime boss, an average pokerfaced motivator for the hero to improve. All else in Baby Driver matches the same sensical nature of Fast & Furious; just the villains run out of bullets when the plot demands it.

I’m sorry if this offends you, but Edgar Wright’s artistic strides in musical **** could benefit greater once he learns about the consequences of his work to live on in history, otherwise, his fans probably won’t live long enough for it to happen."

Character motivations are all over the place like Edgar Wright's hair and editing-wise, wasn't anything special. People seem to harp on about how great the action is and how its well timed to the songs, but I don't see anything great about it to be honest. Perhaps why I didnt like this film is that I've seen it before. That was a masterpiece called Drive and Baby Driver seems to borrow everything about it.

Folks, ""Baby Driver"" is the OPPOSITE of what I just described.

If you're familiar w/ Edgar Wright's best-known directing efforts, for examples the brilliant ""Spaced"" series, his snappy trilogy of films starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (also from ""Spaced"") and the ultra-hip ""Scott Pilgrim"" which turned Mary Elizabeth Winstead into The It Girl of this decade, folks if you enjoyed those works and were expecting something in that vein, but w/ an even cooler soundtrack and cleverly edited car-chases...

...you will be sorely disappointed by ""Baby Driver."" Go in w/ no expectations but forgettable entertainment, some witty barbs, one surprising cameo that's cut short way too quickly, and dialogue/situations you'll wince at more often than not, and just maybe you'll see where the glowing reviews for this are coming from.

In other words, go back to your teenage non-jaded years. This is no ""Drive,"" nor ""The Driver,"" and nothing close to that hair-raising street chase from ""Nightcrawler."" This was ""The Transporter"" w/o a believable lead nor pulse-raising fight scenes. Or indeed, chase scenes worth recalling. ""Baby Driver"" does boast Jon Hamm's impression of The Terminator, and an ending that comes after what should have been the ending, after an uncomfortable amount of waiting time.

To wit: This DOES NOT live up to its ridiculous amount of hype. I'm rating this as high as 4 of 10 because it wasn't a bad film, just oh-so very disappointing. You've been warned."

The lead man, the lead villain, and the lead criminal are all white men. The female love interest is mindlessly devoted to her man.

The cast are firing on all cylinders but the film annoyingly see-saws between good and fair throughout due to some loose writing. Strangely the music choices are often only ok, although credit must be given for them not having been over used in other films. Standout music piece is a track by 'Focus'(taken from Focus Three if I'm not mistaken)to accompany a chase sequence on foot involving 'Baby Driver' Ansel Elgort, who for once is actually good in a role. As befits a crime thriller the editing is sharp and the sound is clear. It must be said that the film definitely leaves an impression after disappearing from the screen.

This is one of the last films I watched as I cleared almost all the titles of this year's Oscars. It is a French-Iranian co-production, but selected and won the Academy Awards for Iran. From the well know filmmaker of that region whose film had already won the same award in the not so past. I'm not just addicted to Hollywood. I'm a film fanatic because I give equal preference to films of the whole world. So I have seen as many as this year's submission for the Oscars in the category of the Foreign Language Films. And there are lots better films than this, that even did not make into the final five. From my perspective, this is an okay film, even comparing with the rest of the fellow nominees, including that I thought that would win, 'Under Sandet'. The mess is all because of Trump effect, as same reason 'Moonlight' to win the main trophy.

At least it was not an average film like 'A Separation', though not a masterpiece like 'The Past' that did not even nominated for the Oscars. It stands between them. The title name is not exactly relevant to the story. But it helped to extend the plot for an extra 20-30 minutes. An unnecessary subplot, which really were the boring parts. Or you can say, just to attract the western audience with their ingredient and that worked out as planned for the filmmakers. Except those theatre portions, the rest of the film and its storyline looked like I was watching a French thriller.

It is about a young couple who are forced to relocate to another house after their apartment building was declared not safe anymore for some kind of construction taking place in the nieghbourhood which is affecting it. The man is managing his job at a school as a teacher and the remaining time as a theatre artist along with his wife. The life was as usual, till one day something bad happens to his wife at home in his absence. Now he's raged to find the culprit, but once if he did what happens and how the story ends was the another twist.

❝It's obvious you're not the one who found your wife the other day, otherwise you wouldn't say that.❞

It was a very slow start. I mean the opening scene was like racy. And then following, it slowed to build the momentum. That does not mean the characters were developed so well. It only moves forward with constructing what are all needed for later parts. Once it enters the third act, the scenario changes. It looked like another film, another genre. Too tense moment and tight plot for the grand finale. Yep, that is the part makes this film to forget everything you saw in the earlier.

Whatever happened in that part, I felt it was right, though I think culturally it differs the outcome. I mean, that's not philosophically the Iran we know or the religion they worship. You can say the western films badly portrayed them in their films, but if you look at their history, the film ending was shocking. So I thought, the end chaos was for among themselves. If the outsiders (westerners) were involved, it would have been a differently dealt.

Very good performances. But not perfectly written screenplay as I pointed out a few things in the earlier paragraphs. And another thing was, the character, particularly the mysterious one, I was not satisfied how it had been developed. He enters the frame only at the last moment. The narration was very suspense and a bit thriller, but then all the sudden everything comes crumbling down since the end was very near to cease the procession. My point is, how that X man was netted does not make sense in reality. Being a film, it has no problem at all.

So, it was a good film, but not as good as it was praised or won the Oscars. Yeah, definitely worth a watch. The setting was very good, except the ending, as the opinion differs from people to people and the amount of damage on how to deal with such situation. Overall, a little good message at the end, but not exactly a moral message as it brings more destruction towards the GOOD over the BAD which always win with a strong sentimental grip, no matter whoever involved in it.

Using a stage for playing Miller’s “death of a salesman” is one of those notable ideas which provide us a possibility to watch how the lives of people is in some degree just a show and the distinction between the show and the real life is of critical matters of modern life. The other notable idea is a well-illustrated three-dimensional interior space of buildings in both opening and ending sequence of the movie which has a lot to say about how each character is related to the other and to the social life as some sort of a “big other”.
The script of the movie is highly engineered which makes somehow annoying and unbelievable; the set of items left behind by the intruder is just one of them. This all could be neglected if we could pursue the movie but the #1 thing on the “cons” column of this movie is lack of characterization  of the woman (Ra’na) which lives us with our pre-existing judgments about the human emotions and society to help us sympathizing with her, or have any meaningful relation with her situation what so ever; and this makes “the salesman” a mediocre film."

Si un gentil Blanc avait dit ça dans une maison de Noirs, ç'aurait été la lapidation publique.

Il reste donc un petit thriller qui a du mal à démarrer, puis qui vire dans une sorte de grand guignol carnavalesque dans sa dernière partie : c'est drôle en dépit de son délire ou grâce à lui, on ne sait plus... mais c'est drôle. Puis la fin est très classique, trop classique somme toute ( théorie du méchant Blanc tout au premier degré).

Mais imaginez un instant inverser les couleurs et au lieu d'un noir et blancs, faites-en un blanc et noirs : bonjour la tempête de merde merdo-médiatique qui ferait le buzz sur toute la toile ! non, le film serait carrément interdit ! on serait alors passé de la victimisation à la diabolisation... ou la stigmatisation. Ou un nom en ""tion"".

Aussi finalement, donnons une note neutre, une note suisse du lac des quatre cantons : un 5 standard et nominal, un milieu arithmétique propret : du gris en somme."

The movie has a great cast and is technically well made, but to enjoy either you have to get past a ridiculously dumb and incredibly predictable plot. It's listed as a horror movie but it never actually gets scary as the premise is just too far-fetched. For some reason it tries to do jump scares and even gore towards the end but never does it manage to be effective. Sure, the characters create a suspenseful atmosphere but it never manages to create any suspension of disbelief. I read other reviews that mention plot twists but I have no idea what they are talking about. Everything plays out in the most predictable manner.

As far as the social commentary goes, the movie depicts a world in which every white person cannot avoid making racial remarks for one second. I guess it fits the ridiculous premise, but I found it hard to draw any parallels to reality because of how grotesque the narrative is.

Too bad it happens rarely, most of the time it tries to be scary, without being it. It can't even be a thriller because the director spoiled the ""Truth"" in the first five minutes of the film, so you don't get the feeling of discovering the bad guys or something like that.

If it was a black (pun intended) humor comedy with horror tints in a slasher way it would've been awesome (every scene with lil rel howery is great), but when they try to sell you this thriller-esque ""Who knows whats going on here and if there is something to fear"" it is just pointless because you already know."

Part of the problem was certainly due to the fact that I saw this on video after the hype and critical reaction had been built so high that it couldn't possibly have lived up to its 87 Metacritic score and 99% Rotten Tomatoes score. If you like your social satire to be ""hit-you-over-the head"" (repeatedly and literally) obvious, then this might be the movie for you. I guess knowing Jordan Peele's other work, I shouldn't have expected ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" but I did expect maybe an ounce or two of character development and nuance. This doesn't have that. All the tropes have been done before (did you know that white people play lacrosse and like to ask black people about the NBA?).

That said, there are plenty of things to like about this movie. The acting is pretty solid (with the exception of Catherine Keener). Daniel Kaluuya is fantastic. Allison Williams, despite a pretty weak track record, holds up her role with aplomb. Milton ""LilRel"" Howery steals the show with his role as the comic relief/truth teller. Peele's direction does a fantastic job with capturing the creepiness inherent in the setup.

The horror isn't very scary, the comedy is sparse and the racial commentary amounts to 'man, white people say dumb **** over and over and over again.

The major premise of the white people's motivation doesn't add up and as others have said it takes over an hour before it's revealed what the plot of the movie is.

If, like me, you're not from the US, you're going to find this agonizing over the correct way to behave to black people really tiresome too.

1672,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/get-out/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Spangle,"Mar 7, 2017",6,"Think about color. I do not mean race, just color. White, throughout cinema and life as a whole, has taken on a holy connotation. People are safe when they are in the light. Horror movies find their greatest tension at night, not the day. Things do not go bump in the broad daylight. The light shows the truth, whereas darkness hides it and obscures it turning it into the unknown. White is safety. White lights envelope characters in a hidden suit of armor. On the other side of things, black has come to be seen as death and has a far more sinister connotation. The grim reaper wears black, witches wear black, the term black magic, and the darkness itself is black. Black is, more often than not, evil. But, it is through horror movies that these preconceived notions have always been challenged. In the tremendous horror film Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is at her greatest danger in the light. Hitchcock, knowing that people equate white with safety, dumps his protagonist in a bright, white-lit bathroom where she quickly succumbs to the violence of Norman Bates. While horror films today still rely upon people's thoughts regarding white and black, Psycho and many other films saw an opportunity to subvert expectations and show audiences that the daylight is hardly the armor they once perceived it to be. George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead took it even a step further and it is that film that serves as the greatest influence of Jordan Peele's Get Out.

In that film, Ben (Duane Jones) is the only black character and he is also the protagonist. Alongside him are exclusively white zombies and the catatonic white girl Barbra. These portrayals served as the basis for Richard Dyer's brilliant series of essays entitled, White. In these pieces, Dyer argued that white and black came to mean something entirely different in Romero's film. While beforehand, white had always meant pure and holy, whereas black was the exact opposite, Night of the Living Dead changed the talking points. In the film, white came to mean death. It represented order and rigidity. White was lifelessness and, as a result, white people had become zombies. Meanwhile, black was the presence of life. No longer was black the absence of color (life), it was instead the very embodiment of it with it standing it contrast to the zombie-like portrayal of whites. That said, Dyer also asserts that we can only see this dichotomy when whites and blacks are portrayed together. In films with exclusively white casts, such as Sam Mendes' American Beauty, audiences are blind to the whiteness of the characters. The whiteness is simply who they are and audiences miss just how much the characters in films such as that resemble the same lifelessness and rigidity of the zombies in Night of the Living Dead. However, by presenting whites and blacks in contrast to one another, Get Out is able to explore the relationship between the two colors in an entirely racial context.

As is readily apparent in the film, the whites are zombies. They are hypnotized and robotic, they are the pure embodiment of order and rigidity. When Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is in their presence, they all uniformly look at him and stare him down. Their manner of speech is very structured, their commentary predictable (I knew INSERT BLACK ATHLETE or the Obama comments), and their seemingly positive reception towards Chris feels pre-coded. Everything is artificial in this environment and while the film shows it in a humorous light, the lifelessness of this gathering of people is astounding. When the Armitage family throws their yearly party, which is on the same day every year, the entirety of the guests pull up at the same exact time. When they play bingo, everybody wins. While these people may not be zombies, they certainly act like mindless zombies who simply go through the motions of living and are merely watching themselves life.

This, of course, is why the Armitages and other white families utilize blacks. Kidnapping them or roping them in via Rose (Alison Williams), the people of this suburb use black people as vessels for life. Whether it is to live again, to see, or any number of reasons, the whites in the film recognize that the blacks have something they do not: life. Chris is the very embodiment of life. He is energetic and, though cautious about meeting her parents, in love with Rose. He is living life to the fullest at this point in his life and looking positively towards the future. Even better, he is black. Per Dyer, black represents life and this is very much the case in Get Out. His friend Rod (Lil Rey Howery) is boisterous and loud, spitting out comical lines at the speed of light. Compared to every white character in the film, this duo of black characters are full of energy. Every white character, aside from when they put up a facade to trick blacks, just float by."

I'm also a movie and literature fan. The lure of rodeo as with all spectator sports is watching participants attempt to excel at very difficult things that not everyone can do. I often wonder how these young men can suffer injury after injury and still mount up after recovering and I wonder about what their lives will be like when they are too old to ride. Yes, the sport plays upon our yearning for the romanticized days of the Old West but it also allows the participants an avenue for rising above mundane existence.

In literature and cinema I look for something that uplifts the spirit or in dark pieces takes you where you wouldn't necessarily want to walk yourself. This movie however was an hour and forty-five minute exploration of a depressing and mundane existence. Kudos for the cinematography and for the untrained family that acted a dramatized version of their real lives. Kudos for the main character gaining common sense about what he was capable of doing given his physical condition and for his love and care for his sister and his fellow injured rodeo rider. He described himself in the movie not as a bronc rider but as a horse trainer. I hope the family's poverty and isolation does not prevent him from having an opportunity to do that.

As for the reviews that celebrated this as a peg in the takedown of macho culture, fine if one defines macho as brutalizing women and engaging with other men in bar fights.

Is it because the director is a famous Youtube comedian and somehow that automatically makes this a great film? Eight Grade is by far one of the most generic coming of age film that literally has little plot, and has one of the most cliche/general character story ever. The cliche oozes from the first shot of the movie, that has little to no flare and side characters that are never developed at all despite them being essential in coming-of-age films. As a person that has seen Ladybird earlier this year, which was totally amazing, this film is so weak in comparison that it makes Ladybird the Citizen Kane of coming of age films. The main issue in this film is that although it has its sentimental moments and relatable moments with the girl and her father, the audience clearly knows where its going 100% all the time and there is little to no drama to any of what is happening on the screen. This film is literally a Film 101 to coming of age films but its so bare and stylistically bland that it develops pacing issues despite being a very condensed film. Worst of all is the fact 8th Grade is marketed as comedy despite the fact there is hardly any comedy in it. The lead girl is fine in her role, but everyone one else is a walking stereotype with absolutely 0 character development or anything worth of note. In fact, the majority of the time we spend in the film is just looking at the girl navigating her lonely existence, but it is weird because its seems like shes this new girl but she clearly has been there for a long time and has no friends. I'm not sure what the message is really. 8th Grade is by no means the worst film, but its generic premise and bland execution makes it one of the most forgettable film for this year. Its a shame that film criticism or appreciation is at such a all time low, that mediocre films like this gets unanimous praise across the board when it really doesn't have much going for it. Maybe kids will like it? But literally nothing happens in the film and I love coming of age films like Ladybird, The Way Way Back sh etc.What a shame."

Support The Girls

Support The Girls is a character driven drama about a bunch of women surviving literally a week day of their life. Embracing the premise like never before, Bujalski's hands on execution of offering the insights with a personal touch of the characters communicates throughout the course of the feature to the audience. It is a subtle take on the marginal community that we all reside in, and so is its repercussions on the audience of its higher concept, it may not be glorifying for everyone. But as much as makers distract the audience and is proud of its ingenious methodology, contrary to popular belief, it is quite louder on repetitive terms. It tosses all possible various situations through character's perspective in order to make its definite point thoroughly clear. In order to do so, it shucks away its somewhat middle act with an arguably redundant sequences. But such compelling storytelling and euphoric energy behind the camera can be and should be given the benefit of doubt. The background may as well be daft with decent cinematography and editing that is saved by the camera work which again, offers personal touch making it more human than ever. The performance by the cast is on full throttle; especially Hall, since they are aware of the opportunity and stage they have marked, can factor a lot. Bujalski's execution is to the point and clearer than ever with a smarter script and even though familiar but not so explored structure makes it gripping and adaptive for the viewers. The three dimensional characters, layered thought provoking policies and fair confessions are the high points of the feature. Support The Girls may not be the game changer but if retold in a glorifying manner, it can be your ""Thelma And Louise""."

This lets Linklater fully explore the male character, a theme he embraces fully, something he is oft criticised for the neglect of female characters.

Amid a cast where it is easy to map the characters from Dazed and Confused, Glen Powell stands out as Finn, providing the film's voice of reason. The film’s strength lies in its dialogue, with the best scenes featuring characters simply talking and hanging out.

Linklater’s keen ear for authentic dialogue and period details shines throughout the film. Much like in Dazed and Confused, the soundtrack drives the narrative, perfectly capturing the era’s vibe and enhancing the overall experience.

Linklater continues to reshape the jock image, showing them as complex and intelligent, primarily through Powell’s character. Despite this, it fails to critique their outdated views on women, failing to build depth in the portrayal.

Everybody Wants Some!! is a nostalgic, dialogue-driven film about male camaraderie and college life, making it a worthy successor to Dazed and Confused through its engaging portrayal of youthful camaraderie."

I'll chime in with the problems. There is no plot. That's not necessarily a problem if it's a slice-of-life movie, but for that type of movie to be good, it has to have charm, humor, and poignancy, and this movie has none of that. It mostly not funny. There are a couple funny lines and a couple funny scenes, but otherwise, the dialogue is overwrought. It is trying so hard to be a nostalgia piece that it is just a bunch of patched-together memories from Linklater's life.

The set design is lame. Like, after-school-special lame. Everything is so clean. This is a small Texas town in 1980. Every bar looks like it was built by a college drama set design team the day before shooting. Some empty cups just so. No overfilled ashtrays, no smoke, no dirt. Come on! Film it on location! The only exception is the players' house, which did remind me of my old college house. But still way to shiny and clean.

The actors and costuming are lame. Too shiny. Too perfect. Too ""just so."" The clothing is accurate to the period, but looks like it was made by a seamstress the day before. No wrinkles. No stains. No authenticity. Just facsimiles of early-80s clothes. Everyone is cleanly shaven in every scene except for their distinctive facial hair. No five-o'clock-shadows, no missed spots. All the hair is perfect all the time. No frizz. No day-before-a-haircut outliers. No sweat!!!! Nothing. It all adds up to the movie looking like a soap opera. Compared to the real dinginess of Dazed and Confused, it totally takes away any sort of suspension of disbelief. Add to that the IMPOSSIBLE attractiveness of all the actors! Ridiculous. Everyone in 1980 had perfect white teeth, apparently. Go back and watch Dazed and Confused. The lead was average looking, as were many of the other characters. Even Affleck and McCoughnehey (sp?) weren't perfectly dressed up all the time. The girls were pretty but mostly not supermodels. It just looks ridiculous. Kids at a third-tier state school in rural Texas in 1980 did not look like this. Big difference from Dazed and Confused here.

Finally, there was just no point of view. No one grew up. No one changed. No lessons learned. Just a bunch of vignettes. And even those were mostly not funny or interesting. I give it a 5 because there were a handful of decent scenes, and at times it seemed to be gearing up to go somewhere... it just never did. People still quote Dazed and Confused. No one will EVER quote this movie. You can bet on that.

Don't waste your time. I can't comprehend the positive reviews, especially from professional critics. This movie was not good at all."
1707,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/everybody-wants-some!!/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Dzimas,"Jul 19, 2016",5,"Well, you know everybody wants some, but this movie looked more like Porky's than it did Dazed and Confused.  Blake Jenner plays the supercool freshman, Jake, who strides into Southeast Texas College as the new BMOC.  I thought he might have been the freshman in D&C but that was Wiley Kramer.  This movie would have been fine if it was a little more self-effacing, but instead it is a self-indulgent romp where Richard Linklater re-imagines his college experience covering every single musical group of the era with a copious selection of albums that everyone is borrowing from each other.

Like the music, the film tries to be everything at once, with no storyline emerging until about half way through when Jake finally remembers the girl in room 307 that thought he was hot and leaves some carnations taped to her door.  By this point, Jake has already scored at least once, but apparently it wasn't enough to appeal to his sensitive side so he goes after the arts school girl with the auburn hair.  He even quotes a few verses of Whitman to impress her.  Wow!

Linklater wants us to know what he read back then too, having Finn conspicuously show the book covers of Carl Sagan's Cosmos and Kerouac's Desolation Angels.  The only problem is that Kerouac cover he showed didn't come out until 1987.  I remember since I bought the book at the time.  At least Linklater got Cosmos right.

Everyone in this film is just too supercool, except for Jay Niles, who reprises a similar character to that of Ben Affleck in D&C..  Of course, McReynolds hits Niles' 95 mph fastball out of the park and hits an easy double off Jake to show who the alpha male is here.   Linklater obviously wanted actors who could swing a bat and Tyler Hoechlin makes it look easy.

But, what to make of all this nonsense?  I doubt even baseball players scored that easy in college, but to watch this romp it was like taking candy from a baby.  The only time they seem to hit a rough patch is when the football players show up at the Sound Machine, forcing the boys to don cowboy hats and saunter on over to the local country bar, putting on their best ""Urban Cowboy"" impressions.  The country girls eat them up.

What made Dazed and Confused work was that it effortlessly fit around the theme of the last day of school with a big party that night.  Linklater introduced us to wide range of characters, the various cliques and the inevitable confrontations that ensued.  In this movie, everyone gets along just fine.  The baseball team even crashes an arts school party, laying all the girls there too.  It's all just so free and easy you'd think no one ever heard of venereal diseases before.  The only character to have any concerns is ""Beuter"" who is worried his girlfriend might be pregnant, skipping out on all the fun to go back to his hometown to calm her down.  Who needs a drip like that around anyway?

It would have been better if Linklater had left well enough alone rather than revisit his old haunts.  I guess he got bored, like Tarantino gets bored (I heard there is another Kill Bill in the making), and wanted to rekindle a few college memories for us.  Next time, work out a storyboard, Richard!"

Written by Kantemir Balagov and Aleksandr Terekhov and directed by Balagov, Dylda is inspired by (although not based on) The Unwomanly Face of War by Svetlana Alexievich, an oral history of the experiences of Russian women who fought during World War II. We've seen countless stories (many of them superb) about men who have fought in war, only to find themselves unable to reintegrate into society upon the cessation of combat, but Dylda is the story of two such women. And whilst one has to admire the emotional and ideological sincerity of the filmmakers, and the craft on display, for me, Dylda was a somewhat disappointing experience, adding up to something quite a bit less than the sum of its (often exceptional) individual parts.

Leningrad, 1945. Iya (an astonishing debut by Viktoriya Miroshnichenko) is a former soldier invalided out of active duty several years prior, who suffers from a severe case of concussion-induced PTSD that manifests itself as random episodes of total paralysis. A nurse in a hospital for wounded soldiers, she lives in a small one-room apartment with her son, Pashka (Timofey Glazkov). Meanwhile, Masha (Vasilisa Perelygina, in the film's second exceptional debut performance), who served with Iya, returns to Leningrad unexpectedly. Suffering from her own PTSD, which causes her to be cruel and selfish, Masha learns of a horrific accident recently experienced by Iya, and so begins to push her along a path that could destroy both.

Aesthetically, you'd be hard pushed to find fault with Dylda, with Sergey Ivanov's production design especially laudable. The hospital is grim and underfinanced, Iya's apartment is modest but homely, and the streets are cold and alienating, the aftereffects of the Siege of Leningrad still very much apparent. Despite everything looking completely authentic, the exteriors weren't shot on location, but were sets built for the film, making it all the more impressive. The tone is helped immeasurably by the film's palette, which is extremely drab, dominated by grey, dirty yellows, some white, and, especially, a sickly green, with virtually no blues, purples, or reds for much of the film.

Also in terms of the aesthetic, Balagov and cinematographer Kseniya Sereda often shoot in very long takes, affording the audience nowhere to hide. One notable example of this is a scene depicting one of the most harrowing deaths I've ever seen – a scene which goes on and on and on without a single edit, driving home the abject horror of what we're witnessing.

Thematically, the film is about broken people trying to put themselves back together, much as the city around them is trying to do the same. The fact that the Siege was lifted and the Germans defeated means relatively little in the day-to-day. The Leningrad of the film is a place where many of the norms of society have eroded, where any sense of Utilitarianism has become secondary to the mechanics of survival.

For all its laudable aesthetic elements and thematic complexity, however, I was disappointed with Dylda. I have no problem with bleak stories; in fact, generally speaking, I'm drawn more to bleakness and pessimism regarding the human condition, not just in cinema, but so too in fiction, theatre, poetry, and painting. However, I found the film too long, with it feeling padded in places, especially in the sense that Balagov tends to let scenes run a few beats longer than they need to. The aforementioned death scene is very long, but it works because of the length, affording the audience no respite. Other scenes, however, simply run long without much in the way of thematic justification. On occasion, Balagov can also be far too didactic, overstating emotions and literalising internal conflicts. At the same time, some of the most important plot points come across as contrived. Additional, the film is both front and end-loaded, with the best scenes and most interesting themes coming in the first and last acts. Unfortunately, much of what's in between is unfocused and flabby.

Dylda won Best Director and Best Film in the Un certain regard section at Cannes and it was Russia's entry for Best International Film for the 2020 Academy Awards, and is expected to make the final five nominees. So, I freely admit I'm swimming against the tide in saying I didn't really like it. I can certainly celebrate its craft, its thematic sophistication (that Balagov is only 28 seems almost impossible given the thematic maturity), its acting, and the way it isn't even remotely interested in conforming to prescriptions adopted by more mainstream films. And ultimately, although I didn't especially like Dylda, and was somewhat disappointed by it, I certainly admired the hell out of."

Ponderous and hagiographical, the movie details the career of what can most accurately be described as a very unusual man who just happened to find a noncompetitive niche for his talents in the nascent public TV medium.  The biographical elements that might have made the movie much more interesting to people who were acquainted with Fred Rogers primarily through Eddie Murphy and Johnny Carson's parodies of him--where did he grow up, what were his parents like, what were his experiences growing up in school, how did he meet and court his wife, what did his kids have to endure as a result of having such an unusual father, what drew him to focus his work on preschoolers--are conspicuously absent from this biographical documentary.  Moviegoers leave the theater having viewed a worshipful account of the adult professional life of an apparently virtuous but--frankly--downright weird character whose most salient characteristic was being so consistently strange that other people found him disarming."

Call me puritan all you want, I just found this to be a bit *too* horny at times. Obviously some of the ideas at hand are purposefully perverse and controversial, but with the way some scenes and shots lingered, I couldn't help but feel a bit uncomfortable by things. Make no mistake, this isn't porn or anything. I just think that certain ideas behind certain scenes could have been streamlined. That aside however, I had a good time with this. The narrative is exquisitely dark, yet tender and well-constructed. You gotta love double-crosses that are followed swiftly by a double-double cross. Again, solid stuff overall. Just not sure I'd ever be able to recommend this to my parents without blushing."

I enjoyed the narrative fine on its own, and i even find myself thinking about it sometimes, plus as we all know this movie is visually stunning..... but its also CLEARLY written by a man. Especially the love scenes, it feels oppressively pornographic and kind of embarrassing to watch. There is also way too many scenes where a male character forces himself on a woman. I understand the point they went for here but sometimes its just too much (and really uncomfortable). I'm still not quite sure what the audience for this movie was supposed to be. I understand that this is a very important movie for korea- and it has a very happy ending! So its immediately way better than most english lesbian films, but uh anyways if youre like me you probably wont be as impressed with this film as most seem to be, so dont get your hopes too high because you saw the bathtub scene online (like me)"

That aside, it was a decent film. In terms of sensuality, I was a bit disappointed. It was all I could hear about the film, and how it would be tense, and when the tooth scene came up so quickly and intensely, I was intrigued for the rest of the movie. But it let up, and there wasn't much sensuality that was as engaging aside from the first bed scene. I believe that the reception of the movie as extremely sexy perhaps has more to do with the lesbian aspect of the film as opposed to the actual sensual aspect. And perhaps that also has to do with lesbianism in South Korea, though I don't know much on the topic. Something disappointing as well was that the twists in the plot became somewhat predictable. The first one was surprising, though not in a way that sticks with the viewer. I think that they shot the scenes with different takes to change subtly change the interactions of the characters across the parts, like in American Psycho with Bale and Dafoe, but it's only my impression, I'm not sure. All in all, a pretty decent movie."

There's a large dose of somewhat explicit lesbian lovemaking (the film isn't rated), but their over-the-top reactions render them more stylized than passionate.

1733,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,drqshadow,"Sep 23, 2024",6,"Quentin Tarantino's back, with a grand posse of his favorite actors, to tackle the faded sheen and troubled dreams of celebrity life in Hollywood during the late '60s. Although their subjects are quite different, this film's structure is very similar to the preceding Hateful Eight, in that it takes forever to get where it's going and tends to linger on short, irrelevant asides that add to the tapestry but don't have much influence on the greater plot. It's loaded with flavor, lovely little touches that bring a very specific slice of life back into the present, but after a while it begins to feel over-indulgent. As if the director just wanted an excuse to recreate a beloved time and place, then take a stroll, breathe the air and look around.

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is peppered with entertaining performances and amusing cameos, with particularly impressive work from Margot Robbie as the sweet, sunshiny Sharon Tate and Brad Pitt as a guarded, past-his-prime bachelor in the John Wayne mold. The city and studio lots all look great, bustling and alive, with various characters' paths crossing in a string of complex, delightful coincidences. And the last scene, loosely (er, very loosely) depicting the Manson family's violent siege on the Hollywood Hills, is pure Tarantino. Chaotic, gratuitous violence, rampant unpredictability, explosive payoffs... it's crookedly wonderful in the most wicked of ways. I don't want to spoil anything, because the surprise is part of the fun, but at that moment it changes gears from Hateful Eight to Inglourious Basterds. You'll know what I mean when you see it.

I didn't dislike this, but I didn't love it. It certainly would've benefited from some selective editing and smoother pacing. I think the importance of Sally Menke, Tarantino’s longtime partner and behind-the-scenes collaborator, who died in 2010, has been evident in the director’s recent output."

I kept thinking the ending was gonna save it. There’s the scene with the little girl actor where Leo talks about the book he’s reading. A western where the hero is old and has a hip injury and is still trying to fight. When I saw this scene, I said- that’s gonna be the ending! The Leo character is gonna pitch this book for a movie and it’s gonna be his best, most personal performance. I doubled down on this idea when Brad Pitt got stabbed in the hip, meaning he could still be the stuntman for the adaption because they both had hip injuries. I also thought this would be like the Hey Arnold episode where the action star had to step up in real life and get over himself. I thought Leo and Brad were gonna see the Manson clan attacking the neighbors and Leo was gonna have to go save them, thus getting his introduction to Roman Polanski.Either of those ideas would’ve made the movie make more sense and carried an actual theme throughout. Instead, Brad Pitt who, even discounting the dead wife, was violent with his coworkers and police, got to continue his violence and be a hero for it. And Leo managed to save himself, and then get rewarded in such a shallow silly way by gossiping with his famous neighbors about it.I wish they’d had Sharon Tate be an actual person, instead of this perfect, cutesy person who everyone is in love with. Not saying she wasn’t a lovely person, but the way they did it was boring and cliche (everyone staring at only her in a huge party of people dancing). And of course, as you pointed out, all Manson complexity was dwindled down to “hippies”. Manson wanted power and fame. He wanted a race war so he could capitalize off it. The little scene where he went to the Polanski house was pointless, and told us nothing about his character- the weird charm he has over people, his motivation, nothing. Id rather he had remained an unknown the whole movie than have this scene that meant nothing. If they only wanted to show that he knew this address, Pussycat could’ve mentioned how Charlie used to live over there. She saw Brad and Leo driving away from that nice area the first time they waved at each other. The whole ranch scene was good and tense, but the George thing went nowhere and dragged on.Lena Dunham was weird casting, and took me out of the moment. There was so much racism, that it went from realistic for the time up to bad satire. I honestly can’t tell if Tarantino is genuinely nostalgic for this time, or making fun of people who are."

For me, the audience member, this all seems rather pointless. Sometimes I want to know how the sausage is made. I don’t want to celebrate it.      

Keeping in mind that this movie takes place in a world that existed before I was born, I was impressed by the plethora of vintage signage, cars, costumes, and attitudes. Entire streets appear to have been transformed. The problem is that much of the film relishes in showing the dressing. As a museum exhibit, this would be spectacular.      

Tarantino’s trademarks are all here as a kind of self parody. No spoilers but if you have seen Tarantino’s works, you know what I mean. There is some fun to be had with seeing two of Hollywood’s top actors pretend to hang out like old friends. None of it makes for a story.     

I should appreciate this kind of meandering storytelling. So many movies follow the same plot that I feel like I have seen them all before. But a truly clever movie will avoid the standard plot and still get somewhere on its own. This story feels thrown together to hit the highlights of this bygone era.

Большую часть времени, ну 90% примерно, составляют тупые, монотонные диалоги. Диалоги которые ничего не объясняют и не к чему не ведут. Вот к примеру, герой Дикаприо садится на стул рядом с девочкой и ни с того ни с сего начинает лить слёзы, о том какой он несчастный и ни кому не нужный, и так на протяжении 15 минут. К чему всё это? Не понятно. Смена кадра и всё, никто не вспомнит про этот эпизод вообще никогда. И вот так или почти так практически весь фильм.
Повествование часто прерывается на полуслове и больше никогда к нему не возвращается.
Это же касается и эпизода с персонажем Питта. Он вдруг ни с того ни с сего то ли реально оказывается, то ли просто вспоминает, я лично не понял, себя на съёмочной площадке с Брюсом Ли, а потом ни с того ни с сего начинает с ним реально драться и умудряется навалять ему люлей! При том сам Ли показан каким то самодовольным хамом. (Хотя люди, лично знавшие Брюса, всегда писали про него как про человека достаточно скромного). Зачем всё это? Тайна.
Даже поездки, просто поездки на машине без диалогов, в фильме настолько нудные и долгие, что создаётся стойкое впечатление искусственного растягивания хронометража. Как в какой нибудь GTA.
Экшен сцены двигающие сюжет в фильме тоже есть, но их совокупная длина составляет минут 15 из 2 часов 40 минут протяжённости всего кино. И эти сцены показывают нам дружбу двух совершенно разных людей, чьи судьбы прописаны очень поверхностно.
Так же в сюжет напихано много разных реальных и придуманных персонажей. Но зачем их сюда напихали, одному Тарантино известно. Эти персонажи не несут вообще никакого смысла. Такое ощущение, что снимали сереал часов на 15, а затем передумали и обрезали его до одной серии и выпустили в прокат.
Как не странно, но это произведение не имеет вменяемого начала, в нём намертво отсутствует завязка и кульминация. Ёлы палы, у него даже нормального конца нет?
Короче, фильм ОЧЕНЬ, ОЧЕНЬ на любителя. Я таким любителем не оказался."

The lide that cinema could subvert the course of history (even if we already saw it in ""inglorious basterds"") could be original but the execution was not Tarantino's best. And it's an euphemism."

Not my cup of tea, maybe somebody will love it, but the way it is directed, combined with its uneventfulness and uneven theme, bogged the viewing a lot.

The story has very little get up and go, which is weird for a Tarrantino movie. The ending felt abrupt and shoved in. One of fav Tarrantino movies was the Hateful Eight, simply because time was taken to introduce the characters and make them interesting and depth. In this movie the characters feel frankly shallow. The acting, unsurprisingly, was great and full of life. What let them down was the characters themselves. I didn’t care about any of them.

As a piece of 'film-making' this is amazing cinema. As a movie, it's pretty crap if I'm being honest.
Beyond the way it looks and sounds, the great acting across the board and the attention to detail.. The film is missing a story, and a coherent plot.
At 160 minutes, the film is at least 40 minutes too long. There are innumerate stretched scenes, extended tracking shots, pointless dialogue and flashbacks that serve no purpose.
Even the finale where QT finally throws in some violence and blood seems forced, and because the rest of the film is very tame in that respect it doesn't fit the established ideas.

A construção de personagem e admirável, mas tirando isso o filme é longo demais... O fechamento do filme é um grande vácuo de todo resto. Alguns personagens ficaram voando em sua narrativa, eu esperei muito, pra tão pouco... Essa é minha primeira decepção com o Tarantino."
1764,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,WhiteWolf_1984,"Dec 14, 2019",6,"I think this is Tarantino's worst movie as director. It's an alright buddy comedy movie, an above average one but for Quentin, it's not very good. The movie focuses mainly on the friendship between Rick and Cliff (DiCaprio and Pitt). The friendship though felt awkward and kind of unnatural, Cliff was nothing more than Rick's unpaid chaperone while also being his personal stuntman. Their relationship seemed forced and just as a side effect of their jobs (and plot), not because they really liked each other. It spoilt my immersion into their scenes together and my interest in them as characters. When they aren't together but doing things alone the movie is better and the funny scenarios they get caught up in are amusing but not hilarious moments like in Inglorious and Pulp Fiction. I chuckled a lot but hardly laughed out loud. The big finale is more wtf and exciting than a belly laugh. The dialogue in sharp and gets your attention with wit but the story doesn't really go anywhere. I get Tarantino likes to break up his movies making them non-linear but ultimately every scene compliments the narrative and builds up to a logical conclusion. However, Once Upon... is just a collection of unique moments which our protagonists find themselves in, which although reasonably enjoyable, don't add barely anything to the narrative for much of the runtime. The last third of the movie is much better and meaningful which just is a bit frustrating because if the film was more cohesive like the final third, I personally would have liked it a lot more than i did. Ricks journey gets interesting 90 minutes in and Cliff gets a worthwhile plot. The finale is entertaining but the ending is a let down, it's like they go through a big event and just forget about it like nothing happened, The End. The movie wastes a lot of time on Sharon (Robbie) whose scenes are dull and just feel like filler. They don't go anywhere and eventually here character is just forgotten about. It felt like a tribute to the real Sharon Tate which is probably the case if you know what happened to her in 1969 but apart from being a tribute and a nod to the past, her scenes just feel unnecessary. This movie had real potential and just fell flat, all the cool 1960's Hollywood back drop and nostalgia wasted for a mediocre comedy. I think Tarantino films are more about imagery, quirky characters and honouring classic movies than about telling a gripping story and grabbing your attention these days."

All style over substance and you are just waiting for a plot twist or just anything interesting to happen. I usually love his work but I’m left a little shocked at what a non event this movie is. If you want a documentary of life around this time then you’ll be satisfied with the indulgent subject matter, but if you’re expecting another great entry into  Tarantino’s filmography prepare yourself for disappointment. The reason for this failure? I think it was the Manson family plot line that probably seemed a great idea to frame the narrative early in the writing process, but just ended up literally sending the director up a creative cul-de-sac."

That being said, this one is definitely one of the weaker in Tarantino’s filmography, despite a gorgeous look and two very good performances from its lead actors.
I think what ultimately kills this film is the aimlessness of its dialogue. This is Tarantino style dialogue, to be sure, but it isn’t quite Tarantino substance. Whereas in his other films, the dialogue is wandering and seemingly pointless at times, there was always a purpose behind every word. I don’t feel he was able to capture that cohesiveness that his other films managed to obtain. It’s not a terribly made movie, not at all. It just isn’t great."

Because of these story lines, there are some amazing scenes which seem redundant to the story in the end. My feeling after watching the movie: ""This is some crazy ****"", but not necessarily because it was that good, but because the movie felt a bit crazy and therefore in the end has difficulties to truly shine.

Instead what is offered is 3h journey to the 1969 which was really well done, alas uneventful. Sure there are few Pitt scenes that stand out but those are it - rest of the film is like forced and mandatory 60s commercial. Tarantino brings all his childhood crushes and influences to the screen - Polanski, Bruce Lee, stuntmen, riding cool cars, moviemaking backstories and business, watching movies in cinema etc - lots of bowing to the past glory days. Actors performances are fine but fail against weak story. 4/10 and never watching it again, any of his previous films are far better."

La juventud que la actriz y directora Olivia Wilde presenta en ""Booksmart"" está llena de privilegios ignorantes y celebra los valores más incorrectos que justo la juventud necesita vencer y cambiar.
La cultura Pop ha producido films sobre la rebeldía, energía y desenfreno juvenil que, junto a films como ""Superbad"" (2007) y ""Project X"" (2012), solo fortalecen el estereotipo que la juventud americana se ha ganado: una sociedad de derroche y consumismo irresponsable e innutil.
Amy y Molly (Kaitlyn Dever y Beanie Feldstein), están a un día de graduarse de la preparatoria cuando se dan cuanta de lo tontas que fueron al estudiar y no salir de fiesta al mismo tiempo, por lo tanto deciden hacer de su última noche la más loca y aventurada de su preparatoria.
No es difícil identificarse con esa juventud, todos lo hemos sido y, al menos un poco, hemos sentido los privilegios de pertenecer y los miedos de ser minoría. El problema es que el guión asume que ""pertenecer"" es diversión, alegría y festejo, y lanza a sus actrices a una aventura que, en vez de disfrutar, las convierte en patéticos intentos de retroceder a una actitud primitiva. Asimismo promueve la actitud del exceso, el ceder a los impulsos sexuales y mentales, la desconfianza social y ""soluciona"" la idea de ""comprar amigos"" con romance. Aunque hay una secuencia de animación (que se puede quitar sin daño alguno), la escena que le da valor a la película (e, irónicamente, se enmudece) es un conflicto verbal que muestra el talento actoral de las protagonistas.
A pesar de que el film tiene la oportunidad de exponer un drama socio-cultural, prefiere optar por el camino cómico e inconsciente de su misma cultura. ""Booksmart"" es peligrosa y me causa pavor imaginar cuantos jóvenes pueden verla y querer crecer igualmente solo porque es ""cool"". No lo es, hay diferentes tipos de diversión, y entregarse a los impulsos es la forma más irresponsable de vivir.

The youth that the actress and director Olivia Wilde shows in ""Booksmart"" is full of ignorant privileges and celebrates the most incorrect values that the youth needs to overcome and change. The Pop culture has produced films about young rebellion, energy, and wildness that, along with films like ""Superbad"" (2007) and ""Project X"" (2012), just reinforces the american stereotype that youthhood has won: a society of waste and useless, irresponsible consumerism.  Amy and Molly (Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein), are about to graduate from high school when they realize how foolish they were by studying and not going out to parties at the same time, therefore they decide to make their last night of high school, the most adventurous and crazy. It is not that hard to identify yourself with this youth, we all have been young and, at least a little, have felt the privileges of belonging and the fears of being an outcast. The problem is that the script assumes that ""belonging"" is fun, joy, and celebration, and throws their cast to an adventure that, instead of enjoying, it makes of them pathetic attempts of behaving in a primitive way. Likewise, it promotes excess behavior, giving in to the sexual and mental impulses, the social distrust and ""resolves"" the idea of ""buying friends"" with romance. Even though there’s an animation sequence (that can be taken out with no harm), the scene that gives some value to the movie (and, ironically, is muted) is a verbal conflict that shows the acting talent of the main cast. Despite the film has the opportunity of exposing a social-cultural drama, it prefers to take the comical and unconscious path of the same culture. ""Booksmart"" is dangerous and it makes me dread to imagine how many young people can see this and would want to grow up just like that because it's ""cool"". It's not, there are different types of fun and giving in to the impulses is the most irresponsible way of living."

But other than that, It's neither funny nor original. I have seen quite few films with this theme, or that are classified under this sub-genre (I haven't even seen Superbad), but I already found everything here quite familiar. The plot itself is clichéd, insipid, formulaic, and oversimplified. And you can clearly notice that at every single turning point in the story. And there are a lot in the second half, for it's very overstuffed, messy, and muddled. And that, of course, caused a lot of tonal imbalances.

I'm really frustrated because I thought I would see something like Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig's fantastic and highly auspicious directorial debut. But Booksmart seems to think it is much smarter then it actually is. I have to give Olivia Wilde points for making such an energetic and colorful film, though. Also, these flashes of wit I've mentioned above are all due to Wilde's direction. I do think she has a quite promising directorial career.

There were a handful of mildly amusing moments for me, and Feldstein is mostly charming throughout (the same can't be said for Kaitlyn Dever however, who've I've always found to be really annoying in most films.) Overall, only a handful of decent moments and Feldstein's performance didn't really make this one too worth it for me. I really think Olivia Wilde should just stick to acting."

I comment this because after finishing this film I found myself quite confused because many of the opinions that I was reading and that I was finding about the story of this film made me ask again and again what those people saw that I didn't.

Olivia Wilde basically made Superbad female version and that's not her fault. Well in a way it is because she chose that script to debut as a director but the rest is the fault of the writers because they were the ones who implemented this story but analyzing it, you will realize that you're practically watching the same film. The only difference is that the main characters in this case are women and they don't have a third character to finish the jokes like Fogell.

Although what interested the guys in Superbad was to get laid, the only difference with these girls is that they try to have fun considering that they apparently think they wasted their time in high school studying to the fullest trying to enter a good college.
Because apparently studying hard and not living at parties with drugs and alcohol is only a crime of the nerds. What a cliche isn't?

But it doesn't stop there. Once the story makes clear where is going, the path that follows is saturated with clichés until the ending.
I don't understand in what way anyone would tell me this is a fresh film, that it reinvents the genre, that it brings something new to the table because I didn't see it anywhere.

Does that mean it's a bad film? Actually bad wouldn't be the word I would chose but irrelevant.
I cannot deny in any way that more stories are needed with female characters, which obviously need more films directed by women.
That the voices of these women should be delivering strong stories and in general terms Booksmart has some of those things I mention.
The director is a woman, the main characters and screenwriters too and I applauded they have that opportunity and that they have the forum for people to see and hear their work but don't disguise the importance of that proposal with the results delivered because I personally think that Booksmart has nothing original or new and that isn't necessarily a bad thing because how many film exists that repeat thematics? However, most of the time that is stressed and criticized and I don't see why in this case it was different and it became acclamation."

Still, as a coming-of-age study of friendship, I thought it would  be more serious and thoughtful. Instead it's a mixture of Clueless, Animal House, and American Graffiti, only on speed and set to the beat of a jackhammer. That is, until the third act, when we learn everybody's really a nice person. Oh, and it ends at an airport, which I've never seen a movie do before. To call the story formulaic would be understating the case. Not a bad film, but nothing special at all, in my opinion."

Wilde has got it. I think so. I mean, there have been plenty debut directors hitting home runs in couple of years. And even though, the director, Olivia Wilde, isn't changing the game or flipping the table, but her rhythm is adaptable to those ever-changing background score that often transcends into a catchy song. Watch her craft a sensible theme that leans towards drama or comedy, within a snap. This risky element in the script does hover around the dangerous territory and when it has to get its hands dirty, it whimpers. The drama is a bit transparent and emotions overridden. The equation between the lead characters, despite of being shallow and backstage when taken lightly, is more absorbent than when it finally reveals its true self.

And no matter how smartly Wilde choreograph these fights with using productive angles and expressive background score, the cheesy liners that initiates the conversations cannot be pulled off with all the distractions possible; no matter how elegant. Beanie Feldstein is the winner. Clearly. Mostly, because she has got a leader-alike role. She is up for anything, overpowering everyone, her personality is, in fairness, crowd pleasing. Her know-it-all attitude draws you in and her.. well, friendship tames you into adoring her.

Kaitlyn Dever, on the other hand, is the underrated star whose zest to keep things vanilla helps survive their friendship. But, surprisingly, as a character, Feldstein can't even stand alone, and Dever is strong when alone, this is where things get juicy and also come to an end; a bit early I'd assume. At the end of the day, this will always be the beckoning of Wilde's talent, that were maybe hidden maybe not, but what's sure is that she is here to stay, in her comic arena, not experimenting but confident in her punch lines."

While the story is capably handled and deftly told, however, I must also admit that there's not a lot here that's especially innovative, masterful or captivating. The sometimes-melodramatic narrative, with its allusions to infidelity and relationship discord, may be daring by Iranian audience standards, but it's hardly the stuff of groundbreaking material in the world of cinema at large. Also, its less-than-subtle metaphors grow a bit too obvious as the movie progresses.

I'm unsure I know what I would want from a 4th Toy Story movie - watching this challenged my perceptions of woody and the gang in ways I didnt expect. Most of the side characters are 'back in the van' for most of this road trip movie so we are spending most of the time with the 'anxiety stricken
mid life crisis woody', an 'uncharacteristically overpowered ninja skilled action ready bo peep' and new characters mentally unwell forky and sociopath gabby gabby... Perhaps i'm jaded from all the years of high quality cgi animated movies but I just wasn't as emotionally connected as I felt I was in previous outings, and so things moved along averagely which for a final toy story could be seen as disappointing? I was entertained but not enthralled as one would hope to be. Everything looks....eerily photo real at this level of quality CGI so thats a thing now! Part of me wished they had left the franchise alone and produced something new instead. Definitely worth a look for pixar fans though."

While greatly animated no doubt, there are moments where this film looks absolutely stunning. But in terms of the narrative Toy Story 4 just isn't all that interesting. Woody has an interesting character arc, but I don't buy that Bo Peep is the one to show him this arc, or that he would come to it for the reasons he does in the movie with his new owner. Forky feels like he's there mostly for comedic purposes than anything else. Which is fine, but he plays too much a big part in the story for him not to feel more impactful. Buzz Lightyear is completely wasted in this movie, the jokes with him seem like something he'd go through in a much earlier film, or heck in the first film. The veterans of the series are completely pointless, I don't see why they didn't make Bo Peep the main character and maybe leave the characters from Toy Story 3  where they were at the end of that film. It's perfectly fine movie for kids overall, but I think the older audiences who grew up with the previous films much leave wanting a bit more."

Forky: “I don’t know.”

‘Toy Story 4’ is a lighthearted adventure that neatly wraps up the perfect character arc, which is light years better than the third, in my opinion. However, in spite of that, I’m still questing why this fourth entry exist, because everything else is paper thin.

Lets start off with the merits: I know saying the animation is amazing isn’t anything new when it comes to Pixar - a company that’s constantly involving with every entry. It’s the same with as saying “Meryl Streep is great in...”, type of situation but needs addressing ever time. I liked how beautifully polished every character and environment looked, which gave the movie a certain quality in richness. There’s a scene at the beginning involving rain that’s close to photo-realism and a clear growth in the animation department. I mean, the difference based on the plastic looking models back in 1995.

Perhaps my favorite character in the entire movie was Duke Caboom played by the breathtaking Keanu Reeves. Despite the little screen, Reeves manages to bring some much charisma and enjoyment to the character it was hard for me not to smile. I was surprised that a few people didn’t realise it was Keanu, but then again he’s casting wasn’t anything secretive if you’re like me that follows announcements on upcoming movies. Anywhere, I could tell Keanu was having a blast with this role and it seems very fitting considering Reeves stunt work.

I was shocked, yet glad that the character of Forky wasn’t as disposable as I originally thought. Surprisingly the main message of purpose and suicide came from Forky’s **** joke, well that’s how I interpret it. It’s something you don’t pick up on, but you’re brain did.

The funniest aspect of the movie came from Bunny and Ducky played by Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key, especially the plan scene where the visual comedy was used effectively for laughs. I thought they were going to be so annoying based on the trailers, but I was relieved that they had some good material for the jokes and punchlines to be funny.

It’s great to see the old gang back together with some welcoming new faces. Although I feel like the old gang got pushed to side characters this time around. Even Buzz didn’t seem to be himself and got backtracked to do absolutely nothing through out the movie. I know there’s a lot of characters and it be difficult to juggle so any, but if we’ve learned anything from ‘Infinity War’ is that it may seem impossible until it’s done.

I’ll give the movie credit for not having any villains, as it would’ve been unneeded and a cheap trick to add dramatic tension.

However, despite the welcoming return and facing new conflict, but everything else has less to desire. I wasn’t quite emotionally involved as I should’ve been, yet at the end, I didn’t hit me as the movie intended. If I have to be honest, after seeing this a few weeks ago, I’m struggling to remember certain scenes. This movie existing is unnecessary as everything felt made up on the spot which I think is the reason why it didn’t emotionally connect with me like the previous three did.

A big step down for the franchise, but family and children will enjoy it no matter what, and that ain't a bad thing.

Overall rating: “I’m trash”"

Dear feminists, you really need to make males look dumb to even being considered as useful?

Toy Story 4 has a dark and creepy tone and several scary ventriloquist dummies that hold other toys captive. For an adult the movie is OK, maybe a 7.

Certain critics who have cited this film as a 'masterpiece' cannot be particularly well-versed in film, nor posses a refined palate; nevertheless kudos to the film-makers who have created a mostly watchable film on a budget of £3m within a 25-day shoot.  The film is simplistic and well paced, with an interesting plot which is fairly engaging. Minus the two youngest cast members (who were surprisingly convincing); the direction given to rest of the cast is dreadful, as is much of the editing. The accents change every 5 minutes. Anya Taylor-Joy gives a promising debut performance (particularly from behind), as does the goat. There are a handful of tense, memorable  and frightening short-sequences featuring the title character, but the delivery of dialogue and lack of character development soon take you back out of the film.

There is the occasional and  impressive use of tableau; reminiscent of 17th Dutch paintings or even Van Gogh's The Potato Eaters, albeit (and disappointingly) shot on a digital camera, which given the budget is understandable.  I guessed the director was in his late-twenties within the 1st half-hour of the film, judging by overall the lack of depth.

The sets, costume design, script and attention to the era seemed very authentic and well thought-out. The acting was decent from the father figure and the main character girl, but the old English vocabulary made many of the lines almost cringey and somewhat comical. The trailer portrayed this movie as something more deep and sinister, every creepy moment in the trailer is all you get and nothing more. Some of the decisions made by the family were hardly logical at all and that pushed the story in a bit of a nonsensical direction. Not as special or disturbing in my opinion as others are saying in my opinion."
1860,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-witch/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,HarriganMtvBlog,"Jun 7, 2016",5,"'The Witch' or 'The VVitch' was a film that I had been interested in seeing but kind of forgot about.

Following the witch mythos of early-American folklore, the story centers around a family that has recently left their village and lives alone on the edge of wilderness. When the family's newborn goes missing as oldest daughter, Thomasin is playing with him, suspicions of witchcraft begin to arise, as the mother is completely devastated.

Later on, oldest son, Caleb goes missing in the woods and happens upon a hovel, where he is entranced by a woman. Caleb would eventually return home, but would die after spouting religious exclamations.

The youngest set of children, a twin boy and girl, accuse Thomasin of being a witch, in which her parents believe them. The next morning, the father is impaled by a goat and crushed under a pile of fire wood, and Thomasin kills her mother after being attacked by her. Thomasin then talks to the goat, seemingly the Devil in disguise, where she signs his book and joins a host of other naked witches dancing and chanting around a night fire in the woods.

The film, although painfully slow and boring in large parts, was almost as equally unnerving and disturbing. The parts where we got to see the witch were truly creepy. We first get to see her as she is about to kill the stolen baby, then covered in its blood. The end where she is feeding off **** on the family farm before slaughtering the livestock (and twins?) was frightening.

The film, although a horror film, didn't hit you with jump scares and cheap thrills, it was more of a psychological scare more than anything. If you can get past the slow parts and tough accents, you might enjoy the film.

My rating: 5 out f 10"

I found it to be more arty yet lacked when it comes to the writing and creating suspense. It just never leaved up to its potential."

Odd choice to try and reproduce the language of the 17th century - but obviously it turns out it's neither historically accurate nor does it immerse the viewer in the particular time setting, and it times it sounds distractingly silly.

It's actually a period drama/thriller that's very entrenched in the puritan movement to USA in the early 16th century. If this time period doesn't entice you, or you find it hard to relate to other cultures, you'll find the film thoroughly uninteresting. If however you can enjoy something a bit different, there's great acting, good tension, and some shocking scenes in this film that will mean it'll have some lasting value at least. It's not a bad film, far from it, it is however an acquired taste and won't be for everyone."

You could say I'm being a bit harsh, but I can say that the director's vision and imagery for this film was great. The art style and language of the film really helped with it being in the 1600's, and that sadly doesn't do justice for me. Yes I may be a big horror nut, but this film didn't pack a punch as far as being ""scary"" or ""frightening"". It did have some disturbing images and the whole wrap up of it all didn't feel quite like the resolution to the film. That is why I gave it the rating I did."

The film is similar to ‘The Babadook’ in some respects due to its lack of reliance on jumpscares and more-so on creating an atmospherically creepy feel to the film. It’s 17th century is a breath of fresh air from the majority of current day setting of modern horror films. However, the film trips up in some parts.
The acting overall is great, but the best being the children in the film who really anchor the films believability. The unsettling imagery creates this eerie and dismal tone over the film that make you feel like you shouldn’t be watching certain scenes.
The Witch itself is an interesting character (Yet rarely seen) as it damages the family in different ways; from straight up kidnap, to seduction, to possession, to murder. It really covers almost every scenario with ease in just 90 minutes.
My problem with this film is due to its dialogue. I know they said the dialogue was taken directly from scripts of the time but they really strained my attention with me finding it hard to buy and swallow at times. The film also focused so much on creating this eerie atmosphere so much that it actually kind of forgets to tell a progressive story at times and can feel a bit stagnant at times. I must admire the film for its tone but solely focusing on that made my mind wither at times.
Overall the film is a horror film you must see in order to make up your opinion on it. Some people love it and some people hate it, but it has shown the progression of horror films moving away from their monotonous feel of the 21st century.

I knew nothing about this movie going into it except that it was a horror movie.  It started out OK- excellent creepiness when The Witch of the Wood stole the baby, but that's where the horror ended.  The rest was a drawn out ""beautifully crafted"" drama typical of independent movies- but the only thing I was scared of, was falling asleep.  It appeared the cast and crew made a true effort to recreate the detail of the time period.  The acting, costumes, set design were all good.

There is an art or at least a formula to doling out scares in horror movies and The Witch doesn't abide by it, frustratingly suffering as a result. The story is painfully linear yet still confusing.

What do these have in common with this flick? They were all hyped as the hot new horror film and I found them to be dismal disappointments. Call me old fashioned, but I like my horror films to be scary. This one is steeped in an interesting period setting (New England, 1630) and drowned in an ominous soundtrack, but the creepy pace and lame shocks don’t make it remotely riveting. A farmer and his family set out on their own, only to be haunted by an unknown evil. True, it’s a compelling concept, but it also lacks any suspense. It doesn’t help that much of the “thee” and “hither” dialect is hard to follow. This is more a period drama in the vein of Miller’s THE CRUCIBLE or one of those Japanese ghost movies, neither of which is ever frightening.

All the critic reviews claimed that it was terrifying and thought-provoking, but it is not.  There are some beautiful scenes and some creepy images, but that seems to be all there is.  The characters in the movie don't react to anything, you never get the sense that the father is someone who would have been banished from a New England colony and they never go into why they are out there.  The main characters are all well-acted, but since none of them have an arch, it doesn't matter.  There's no story being driven forward by the characters, it's just things happening and aren't they scary?  No.  Not really.  Even the one feeble jump scare that seemed to get everyone in the theater was ultimately made pointless by the reveal at the end.  I was trying to think of why it was just not very satisfying and maybe I wasn't getting it (I'm sure ""real"" critics would argue that very idea), but after we left the theater, a girl walking nearby who had just seen it just said ""that was the worst movie I've ever seen"", and I started laughing because, yeah, I wanted to like it like the professional critics seem to, but I don't.

Slow-moving, atmospheric, with an occasional chilling and/or horrifying moment (yes, some good ones, but not many). There's a lot of nearly unintelligible dialogue. One main character has a voice that sounds more animal than human. Key scenes are whispered (in Ye Olde Englishe). And when you do understand the words that are being said, they can be a bit laughable if you haven't submitted to the movie's spell. I guess I didn't, 'cuz I snorted when snorts were clearly far from the maker's mind. That said, its dour gray aesthetic is still floating around in my head, so not forgettable, which has value.

The plot is good, the love of the parents who wish to save their child from the horror that awaits due to the burden of his lineage...apparently. I can imagine it being a great great story on paper but the forcefully drawn out cliche characters paired with cliche moments and dialogues to fill you with synthetic emotions. ""oh! the poor boy"" ""oh the evil antagonist"" ""oh the confused antagonist"" ""oh the confused boy"", so it tends to leave the entire audience quite confused on how to feel about the movie, the twists it takes and its characters. The plot twists can be seen from light years away, at least for me it was and i was wondering if it is more than just a ""good vs evil"" movie, which would have given it so so much depth but the direction managed to make it annoyingly shallow. I would not take anything away from the stop-motion animation as it was always a visual feast in spite of the confusingly portrayed characters. At the beginning it was all heart warming for me seeing the love of son for his mother and vice-versa but as the movie progresses past the 15 minute mark you start to wonder if they are the same characters you thought you knew. Hence, at this point it becomes very clear that the character development is very disappointing, and i use the word ""disappointing"" because the script deserved so much more than what it got. I believe this was because the creators were torn between making it a kids' movie which they would enjoy and also understand in the simplest form without taking anything away from the interesting plot twists, but it failed to do both. This is a prime example how a great script can be ruined by lack of sincerity and vision and i could not help but feel ecstatic imagining what the same script would have done had it fallen into the hands of someone like Hayao Miyazaki who would know these characters and understand their motivations and enable any kid and child to feel for the in the ways they themselves would not be able to understand how. This just shows how much the western movie makers underestimate their younger audiences. They might as well just give out candies and ice-cream at the end to convince them they had a good time. The morally grey characters are forced to side with either black or white which leaves the audience confused on how to really feel about them. I loved the sound and the visuals but they do not do anything more to compensate for it, which might be asking too much from my side. Regardless the visuals are stunning and sounds soothing but they do not tie well with the overall theme of the movie or the characters. The action sequences are just as dull as the characters and the clashes are pretty basic hand to hand combats all the while trying to convince the audience that they are witnessing a battle of some of the most divine beings of the universe. That pretty much sums up the entire movie for me, everything and everyone seems out of their depth here and i can imagine the sigh the writers much have left with after watching it. Nevertheless, i hope in future, a distant future where we have forgotten about this atrocious attempt to take something so artistic and mold it into something so synthetic just to please the movie audience who are far more sophisticated than they give us credit for. I am also very disappointed to see great reviews for the movie which was not bad, nope, i could not be that heartless but fell extremely short of what it could have been and what it was meant to be."

What's it like?: It's a stop-motion film (think Wallace and Gromit and Coraline) but it is much more fluid, as if it was a hand-drawn animation. The story concerns the quest of a Japanese boy to collect three samurai battle gear and to avenge his father's death.

Pros:
1) The story is about a boy who earns his living by telling stories to the people in his village. The best scene is when the boy tells a story **** samurai warrior and one of his adventures, and while doing so, sheets of paper in the boy's knapsack fold themselves into origami shapes that move, fly and float around the boy, so as to illustrate the story better.
2) The cover **** Harrison's song is great.

Cons:
1) The rest of the film, sort of, degenerates into the usual cliches of stories on Japanese Samurai or Japanese culture, or any quest stories, and it didn't innovate much beyond that. The story would still please the much younger people though.
2) There are jumps in the story that seems to be attempts to cover up major plot holes. I was lost in the details and plots of some parts of the film.
3) This Japanese-theme story only had one voice actor of Japanese origin and he is an American citizen (George Takei). Talk about white-washing! I am surprised there hasn't been an uproar on this. Any venture that takes jobs away from struggling actors of non-white origins, regardless of whether it is only voice-acting, is still white-washing!
4) The arch-villain was disappointing.

The best thing about this movie is no doubt the visuals! It oozes charm, originality, and culture. Stop motion fans will be in awe of this movie's action scenes, paper craft at its finest! Also, the voice acting is top notch. Delivery of dialogue is so punctuated yet natural-sounding at the same time. But other than that, there's not much else to like about this movie. Kubo and the Two Strings is based on a folk tale and it really shows! Scenes either go on WAY to long or end WAY to quickly. The plot of this movie is sometimes really predictable and other times stupidly irrational. Also, despite its kiddy looks, Kubo and the Two Strings will scare your kids! It's by no means a horror film with gore and jump scares, but there are some moments that I personally think younger viewers couldn't handle.

1890,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/kubo-and-the-two-strings/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Lennon-S,"Aug 22, 2016",6,"There’s no denying the sheer artistry behind Kubo and the Two Strings. It’s a visually breathtaking film, and the craftsmanship on display is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Every movement, every frame, every stitch of fabric and fluttering paper origami is the result of painstaking dedication by Laika’s talented team. In that sense, the film is a triumph of animation—a living, breathing work of art. However, as much as I can appreciate the labor and skill involved, I can’t help but feel that Kubo ultimately falls short in the one area that matters most: its storytelling.From the opening sequence, Kubo makes a promise—a promise of mystery, magic, and emotional depth. But as the narrative unfolds, that promise is only partially delivered. Yes, the film is drenched in atmosphere, and yes, it has some beautiful ideas at its core—family, memory, legacy, and the power of storytelling itself. But these ideas are never fully realized in a satisfying or coherent way. Instead, the film drifts between set pieces, often leaning heavily on visual spectacle to fill the gaps left by its uneven pacing and underdeveloped character arcs.Take Kubo himself, for instance. He’s a likable character, and his ability to bring paper to life with music is an inspired concept. But beyond that, I struggled to connect with him in a meaningful way. His emotional journey feels more told than shown, and the supporting characters—while occasionally funny or touching—don’t evolve much beyond their archetypes. Even the villains, who begin as haunting and intriguing, eventually fade into narrative convenience rather than embodying any truly memorable threat or psychological weight.When I compare it to another stop-motion gem like Fantastic Mr. Fox, the contrast becomes clear. Mr. Fox is a film with a distinct personality. It has rhythm, clever dialogue, and a consistent emotional tone. It engages not just the eyes, but the heart and mind. It knows exactly what it is, and it excels within its identity. Kubo, on the other hand, seems to want to be a poetic epic, a children’s fable, and a coming-of-age adventure all at once, but it never quite harmonizes those tones. The result is a film that feels slow, ponderous, and at times—even **** that brings me to the larger point: Are we reaching a place in modern animation where visuals alone are being treated as the sole hallmark of artistic success? I find it troubling that so much praise is lavished on Kubo without equally interrogating its shortcomings. A film, no matter how stunning it looks, still needs a strong narrative core. Technical brilliance should serve the story—not mask the absence of one.This isn’t to say Kubo is a bad film. It’s not. It’s ambitious, unique, and clearly made with love. But for me, it was an emotionally distant experience. I watched with admiration, not with investment. I saw the beauty, but I didn’t feel the soul. That **** the end, Kubo and the Two Strings is a masterclass in craftsmanship, but a reminder that beautiful animation alone does not make a film great. It may be framed like a fable, but its heart feels just out of reach."

This film tells the story of a young Japanese boy with storytelling gifts and magical origami skills. He sets out with his friends Monkey & Beetle to discover his family's secrets. While the animation is lovely, the story moves with a humble pace and dramatic nuance that is often slowed by long scenes of gentle dialogue. There are a few modern-style quips tossed about, but this is not a comedy. There's a sweet appeal and a quiet charm, but it ultimately lacks much emotional punch and visual splendor.

If you're interested in hearing a more compelling account about lights in the sky and alien abduction, just tune in to any episode of Coast to Coast AM radio on the subject; you'll be better rewarded there. The treatment of such material here is so ordinary and already familiar that there is absolutely nothing new, original or imaginative about it.

This homage to the original Twilight Zone succeeds on an artistic level. The photography, the dialog and the acting are first rate.  The Twilight Zone delighted with unpredictable endings. This one chooses the most obvious conclusion possible. I kept waiting for a twist but just got credits. It would have made a better conclusion to just leave it a cliff hanger.

Those elements are very significant, because the film focuses on them to put you inside the situation with its strong aura of suspense; I mean it’s completely obvious that this is inspired by The Twilight Zone, because at all time it feels like that.

But as remarkable as these elements can be, ultimately, those same elements don't make up for a story that never manages to evolve.

And after all, and despite the short duration, The Vast of Night makes it clear that there isn't much to salvage to distinguish itself for being more than it really is.
On top of that, we have fairly regular performances and an unsatisfactory conclusion.

I give it a lot of credit for what it achieves with such a small budget, but its strongest elements only manage to take it to a certain point, the other elements had to do the rest, and in my opinion, they weren't successful.

But it is fair to emphasize that being a debut; it's a worthy presentation and perhaps a promise of something better to come."

You Were Never Really Here

The bisection of the scrutiny is so convoluted that it allows the audience to work for it (that raises question whether it is worth it or not? and unfortunately it isn't) which is always good but if it fails to seek attention through this whole process the impact grows shallow. Having said that, the cinematography is utterly beautiful; despite the tone of the feature, there are few genuinely moving scenes like when the protagonist crushes a mint or his bitterly sweet moments with his mother. Lynne Ramsay; the director and screen writer, is no short on execution but its the script that never had enough crisp in the first place to blend in with the viewers. Joaquin Phoenix; at the heart of it, is so good that it aches you to see such a talent go waste by. You Were Never Really Here has short runtime which favors on its side along with brilliant execution, amazing cinematography and heart felt performances but unfortunately all of this is piled up on by this overthought out script that never reaches its destination."

A Ghost Story

Just as the protagonist in the feature, the audience too finds itself solving the puzzle that life is, projected in a way in here which is the only intriguing lose thread in it that one can hold to climb it till the end. David Lowery's execution surpasses its character driven script which may comes off as a bit hoax for the audience but if read between lines, its speaking louder than ever. There isn't much verbal sparrings between any characters hence it relies a lot upon the performance which isn't left short in any way by Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck (as a supporter).

The best performance is by the house. Where was the Ghost therapist when they were needed, or the exorcist?

There are many scenes, including the couple much talked about long takes, that feel like they're there to announce what kind of movie this is (a litmus test of arty endurance - I kept expecting people to walk out or start screaming at the screen but neither happened during my viewing), rather than serve a dramatic purpose. But they only feel that way during the time you are first watching them. After finishing the film and reflecting on these same scenes, they take on a new elegance that wasn't there before. This is a film that probably needs a rewatch for full appreciation, not because of plot complexity but instead emotional.

Other hints that this was a hollow exercise in art: the screen format is square with rounded edges and every scene unfolds with a sloooow pace and usually static camera (the worst is watching her eat a pie in wide shots for at least 5 minutes). In case you hadn't figured it out, this is NOT a horror movie. It's not that kind of spectre, but a lonely soul on an existential journey.

I don’t want to put in any spoilers, but a few things simply didn’t make sense or were downright annoying (like the pie gluttony or the hateful guy at the party who “knows it all”) – and the beginning of the film was so quiet that it may have been meant to shame anyone eating popcorn or pretzels like me.

That was certainly the case for this film prior to me seeing it, as I was highly intrigued by its simple yet universal premise of life, love, loss, etc. Unfortunately, the best way for me to sum this film up is 'huge potential wasted.' The film felt incredibly disjointed, jumping from so many random points and events in time. In addition, Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara's talents felt rather wasted to me, as they literally don't speak for well over half the film (seriously, I'm pretty sure a little over half the film contained no dialogue, as the entire middle act of the film is borderline silent). To top it all off, the film felt to me as though it really had no clear sense of direction or what it wanted to convey at certain times or how to convey certain things. So many scenes felt as though they were there just for filler purposes. An excellent case in point: We get to watch a depressed and grieving Rooney Mara eat a whole pie in her kitchen for about 5+ minutes. Overall, some of the film's ideas and symbolic purposes pertaining to its subject matter were somewhat interesting, and it had some decent imagery as well, but the rest of this film felt very void-like, much like the film's subject matter, which was certainly what I wasn't hoping for."

While it's certainly laudable that the director has aspired to make a picture that appeals to an intellectual and enlightened audience, the finished product could also be seen as an exercise in preaching to the choir. Its depiction of various philosophical and spiritual themes is deftly handled through an atmospheric production design, minimalist dialogue and an ethereal soundtrack, though there are times when the patience of even the most tolerant fans can get tried (and when a fast forward remote would definitely come in handy).

It’s hard to imagine anything less from the likes of Steve McQueen (of 12 Years a Slave) and screenwriter Gillian Flynn (of Sharp Objects and Gone Girl, one of my favorite crime thrillers of all time, funny and pulpy and completely mind-bending), but this movie found its place in the gaps between other heist films. It tells its story through the exquisite beauty of adaptation and underestimation, the negation of action hero archetypes, and (as Slate reviewer Dana Stevens notes) thoughtful commentary about tribal politics and gun laws.

Some of the most striking shots are simple ideas like the long, single take shot of the young politician played by Colin Farrell and his aide blowing off steam after a small event, a camera afixed to the hood of the car captures the stark contrast between the neighborhood  where he’s campaigning and the one where his campaign quarters are, all the while his monologue about the transactional, futile nature of local politics accentuates the visuals. Farrell’s perennial visits to his political rival’s HQ in a cramped church building punctuate story with beautiful conversational set pieces, like the choral odes **** tragedy.

The actual heist is a bit of an anticlimax, as seems the case with all of the great films of the year (the Sisters Brothers and You Were Never Really Here both employ anticlimax effectively). It’s nice to see the way in which nearly all of the legwork is accomplished by the loan, tall, waifish white woman who makes more money than anyone else going on lavish dinner dates with men she meets online. There’s quite a bit of self-awareness in this script that the racial politics of this film use for comic effect.

David Kaluuya is an excellent villain: the scene in the gym is stunning in its construction and trajectory; his scene work while staking the women; listening to pointed but subtly presented news clips and learning Spanish on tape; the bowling alley. The Twists this movie has in store are pretty  impressive. There’s something here for everyone, especially dog-lovers. That white dog better be nominated for an Oscar."

But his previous films he has said each had a personal meaning, and it seems clear, this one had no meaning.  There is no concise point, and no reason for the film to even exist.  I learned nothing new, was not moved, was not excited much, did not laugh, as the script is very droll, very boring, and much of the characters actions are cliche, the type of thing you can see in any mediocre action or TV show anytime.  The only interesting parts were the first 5 minutes, the last 15 minutes, and a few rare snippets of side characters such as Colin Farrell's.  If the whole film was about Collin Farrell's character, it might have made for an interesting drama.  Instead it is pretty much a cliched heist attempt at a movie, but told through a female perspective, which then adds nothing new to the genre, is less exciting, and with the poor dialogue and **** is  not worth wasting time watching unless you enjoy mediocre and cliche average action and TV shows.

Arguably the most ambitious heist movie since Heat (1995), just as did Michael Mann's epic, Widows has aspirations far beyond the limits of its genre. Written by Steve McQueen and Gillian Flynn, and directed by McQueen, the film is based on the 1983 ITV series, written by Lynda La Plante. Operating firmly within a genre framework, it tries to filter the basic heist template through a feminist pseudo-#MeToo prism, taking in political corruption, police homicide, Black Lives Matter, institutional racism, American gun culture, hegemonic masculinity, and the importance of wealth. The problem, however, is that it tries to pack far too much into too short a space of time. Whilst I can certainly appreciate and celebrate how progressive the narrative is, placing a black woman at the centre **** traditionally dominated by white men, the film still needs to work as a genre piece. And this is where Widows fails most egregiously.

Widows tells the story of a team of women - Veronica (Viola Davis), Linda (Michelle Rodriguez, Alice (Elizabeth Debicki), and Belle (Cynthia Erivo) - who attempt to pull off a heist originally planned by their now deceased husbands, and set against the backdrop of an election for the alderman of Chicago's 18th Ward, contested by Jack Mulligan (Colin Farrell) and Jamal Manning (Brian Tyree Henry).

McQueen and Flynn use the material as a vehicle for a racially-tinted critique of both powerful men and the corrupt systems that enable them. By creating a canvas depicting life at various social strata in Chicago - from the inherited white privilege of Jack to the poor black neighbourhoods of Jamal to the ""everything is a transaction"" philosophy of high-powered real-estate - the film attempts to address a plethora of racial, political, and gender issues. And herein lies the problem. Rather than trying to deal with one or two core issues, it instead tries to deal with upwards of about seven, and ends up saying little of relevance about any.

Which is not to say, of course, that none of the themes are foregrounded. Gender, for example, is built into the plot, especially in relation to notions of subverting the patriarchal status quo. As they prepare the heist, Veronica tells the team that their greatest strength is the element of surprise, because ""no one thinks we have the balls to pull this off"". Later, she reminds them they have ""to look and move like a team of men"". Whilst on the heist itself, they have to disguise their voices so no one realises they're women.

Another theme is macroeconomics. An excellent shot in this respect is when Jack and his assistant Siobhan (Molly Kunz) travel from a poor black neighbourhood to an affluent white suburb. Filmed in a single-take, Sean Bobbitt's camera remains fixed on the car's bonnet, with only a portion of the windshield and one of the side-mirrors visible. Meanwhile, we see the city change in real-time in the background, taking only a couple of minutes to go from skid row to millionaire's row, forcing the audience to acknowledge how thin the line is, geographically speaking, between rich and poor.

For me though, the whole thing was underwhelming and predictable, with a twist that's as ridiculous as they come, and a narrative that relies far too much on coincidence and movie-logic. The widows need to disguise their voices on the job? Good thing that Belle's daughter has a gizmo that does exactly that! A highly successful modern-day thief who writes everything down longhand? A team of people (irrespective of gender and race) who teach themselves how to pull off a major heist in a matter of weeks? For all its real-world social and political concerns, I never once bought into the premise that these four women could actually pull this off, and that undermines everything else.

Just because a film addresses certain themes doesn't mean it earns a free pass (""look, Hollywood cares about poor people; we better not criticise the ridiculous plot""), and from a narrative standpoint, Widows is pretty ludicrous. With the plot often feeling contorted to support the themes, rather than the themes arising from the plot, McQueen's didactic concerns overridden his storytelling. More a vehicle for protestation than anything else, because the central heist narrative can't stand on its own, the very real issues that the film addresses are flattened and neutered. The socio-political commentary, for the most part, is never really integrated into the narrative - so you end up with a film that feels like its preaching at you rather than talking to you. If it had embraced its genre a bit more, and eased back on the homiletics, it would have worked much better."

There are gaps and jumps – and mild frustration that becomes disappointment. This excellent cast deserves better. Example: Although this is a heist film, there is almost no tension.

The movie I saw this afternoon “Love and Friendship” is a novella, entitled “Lady Susan”, which she wrote but never finished and was finally published about 75 years later after her nephew took over the task to do just that.

In this film directed by Whit Stillman, who also wrote the screenplay based on the novella, there are a lot of smart, funny, sophisticated lines telling the story of the beautiful, widowed Lady Susan and her manipulations to get her daughter and herself married by any means. We meet many of their relatives, friends and eligible men with the latter being picked by Lady Susan for a role she has picked for each.

The cast, starring Kate Beckinsale as a beautiful, believable Lady Susan and including such actors as Morfydd Clark, Xavier Samuel, Emma Greenwall, Justin Edwards, Jemma Redgrave, Stephen Fry and James Fleet, among others, fit in with the Jane Austen English characters with only Chloe Sevigny standing out for the wrong reason. Tom Bennett provides many funny moments but he seems too silly for the film and story.

Stillman does a good job of directing and offers a first rate production though at time the actors talk to low and/or a bit hard to understand, swallowing up the words in their accents.

Though I would not recommend seeing “Love & Friendship” I do know it will send me to reading the novella “Lady Susan” so I can read the words of Jane Austen and see how, if, Whit Stillman added to the screenplay or undermined the original story."

This movie falls so far below what we've seen with Emma, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice et al. The locations were promising but the cinematography disappoints.
Beckinsale's Lady Susan was not likeable  or vulnerable in the least. For example: with Emma we know that she is manipulative and sometimes thoughtlessly wicked but we still root for her because Gwyneth Paltrow gave her a heart and a character arc.

There isn't much to say outside of my initial summary, this movie had some good acting, some intriguing plot points, and a decent mystery, but I struggle to see how this is being praised the way it is. Hereditary focuses on a family who loses their estranged matriarch, which leads to the grieving family experiencing strange occurrences and haunting scenarios which can only be explained by unravelling the mysterious dark history of their lost loved one. Sound original? Not really, nothing too special here.

The plot is interesting at some points, and it is interesting to see how they were able to weave it all together in the final third, but the outlying problem is that it took way too long to get there. There were way too many irrelevant scenes that contributed little to nothing to the plot as a whole, and this caused the movie to drag on through the first two acts. I found myself itching to grab my phone and browse other movies I could watch multiple times because I was absolutely bored out of my mind. I can also barely classify this as a horror film until the last 10-15 minutes of the film when things start to actually pull together and the whole purpose of the movie is finally revealed. Unfortunately, to me, it was not worth the long wait, it started to become obvious and somewhat contrived going into the final act. I never got the feeling of being genuinely terrified or worried for any of the characters because the danger was never really present, on top of this the atmosphere was not really well built, which is absolutely imperative for a horror/thriller to impress. The soundtrack was acceptable, but nothing amazing to build immersion, kind of reminded me of The Shining a bit.

Toni Collette did an a pretty good job of portraying her character, she was the most convincing actor in the entire film. Gabriel Byrne, on the other hand, was incredibly disappointing, somewhat because he wasn't involved all that much and his character was bland and underdeveloped... every other character was either acceptable or just ""there"" as they did not contribute much.

This film could have been about an hour and twenty minutes and might have been a lot better if they were able to delve into the grandmother's mysterious past a lot sooner because those were the only parts that were able to keep my attention. Trying to put the pieces together before the movie does is most of the fun in a mystery film, when it keeps you guessing, you become entertained, but there was way too much subplot that was getting in the way and destroying the pace of the film. It ruined the entire experience for me.

+ Toni Collette's acting
+ Matriarch's mystery is intriguing, at first
+ Final third is decent

- Absolutely abysmal pacing
- Not a horror film in my opinion
- Way too much subplot
- Unnecessary character development
- Poor writing and plot climax
- ""Disturbing scenes"" are lacklustre
- All other actors are subpar, at best
- Massively overrated, for what reason?

Overall, this movie could have had something interesting on its hands, the initial premise was great, and the story setup from the beginning was good, but the awful pacing, subpar horror/mystery/thriller elements, lack of creepy atmosphere, wasted time, and forced unoriginal ending, make this movie a failure in the eyes of the horror genre. Unfortunately, again, I must mention that critics are really getting it wrong in the entertainment industry right now, 87 is way too high, the only reason I can think of them giving off this rating is simply because they have not seen many horror movies before to notice all unoriginal elements that are present in this film. This movie is a 25 for me."

Hereditary is a slow, plodding, and ultimately boring affair that I couldn't wait to leave behind me. My biggest issue with Hereditary is that it breaks absolutely zero new ground. This movie has been made any number of ways; add to that it hones in only on those who have a fear of spiritual/religious matters. While there are many religious folks left out there to scare with ominous music and a few ""shock"" scenes, the rest of the horror community is totally left out of the gag. Another matter is character development. While aptly acted, I simply didn't care what happened to a single one of these people. They were 2 dimensional as if specifically designed to be horror movie characters. Gabriel Byrne could have been cut from the movie and I'm pretty certain no one would've noticed. Let's hope this is not a trendsetter for the latest wave of horror or we're in for a predictable, dull ride."

I love Toni Collette but she had nothing to work with in this cack-handed mishmash of awfulness that reaches for the elegance of Babadook but collapses into a heap of gibberish. Collette's mom character has to fake anguish and depression (i.e. to herself) but she didn't quite manage to pull it off and just seemed fake, like she was putting in a ""for scale"" performance. The only redeeming factor was Milly Shapiro. Her performance was captivating and the film could have done with a lot more of her in it.

The most disturbing thing about Hereditary is that so many people find it disturbing. I shall choose to see it as an allegory for the rise of Donald Trump, which is the only way it makes sense."

See... I would be praising this film if I got what I'd been promised from the first act, but the film quickly devolves into becoming just another dumb horror film that lacks in any form of depth from the second act on. The only reason I gave this film a 3/10 was because the first act was good and most other aspects of the film were passable. But the more I think about this film, the more I seem to dislike it. Most other bad films in the supernatural horror genre are at least fun to watch, but there were so many moments that I wanted to walk out of Hereditary. Even if I hadn't gone to see it with somebody else, I still would have refused to leave because I held on to that hope that they might just save the film by bringing it back to what the first act had promised, which is something they never did. If you want to walk out of this film at any point, do it, the film doesn't get better, it only gets worse. If you want to watch this film, I'd wait until it's on one of the major streaming services because it's not at all worth the money it would cost to go to the theater."

1998,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hereditary/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,Warrior777,"Jun 17, 2018",1,"There are a couple of veteran actors in this film. Their performance is not sub-par. At first glance, the story seems to be inexorably intriguing. Occasionally, a movie is created, and there is a stark absence of any redeeming qualities. ""Hereditary"" falls into this category. Some classic horror films contain some sort of message of hope or light, but not so with this one. It is a hostile, harrowing, disturbing black hole. I still feel ambivalent about even posting this review. There is trepidation that this may actually encourage someone to go out and see the film. I would urge you not to see it at all, because it is relentlessly dark. It is very emotionally draining to watch. There is no excitement. There is no hope in it. There is only blackness. In particular, if you are a believer, don't waste your time on this film. The pervasive feeling of evil crawls into your skin and refuses to leave. Hollywood has decent material that comes out of it from time to time, but ""Hereditary"" is purely and strictly obscene. If you have kids, it is not appropriate at all. Take your family to see ""Ferdinand"" instead. I am not condemning horror films in general. These observations apply specifically to ""Hereditary."" Don't watch it."

Combined with a low rendered frame rate during non-combat scenes (low FPS so lip syncing is terrible), and a bizarre decision to render some of the 3D models with full physically based perfection, while the rest is cell shaded, add to the lack of immersion in what little story there is.  Two of the spider characters are also terrible additions, that turn this into a very jeuvinile experience half-way through the movie.  This is about as creative as dropping three hits of LSD, grabbing a couple of cans of paint, and decorating the neighbourhood in chaos.  You either have to be a child, have a very low threshold for entertainment, or have been living in a cave to think this was anything other than mediocre.

There is no denying the striking visuals. From dingy apartments to dream-like underwater scenes, the cinematography is beautiful.  That gets the movie a 1.

Unfortunately, the plot is thin as water and the pace is leaden. The length of the film is twice as long as this short story full of caricatures requires.

The movie's biggest flaw is that we are supposed to feel something for the fishman because he is 'intelligent'. Instead he is portrayed as feral with a smaller vocabulary than Koko the gorilla or your family dog... neither one of which should you want to see anyone have sex with.

The romance is imaginary and one sided. Towards the end we see Elisa pour her heart out to fishman who doesn't stop eating to even pay attention.

This movie is for really lonely women who may find it moving. I found it as romantic as a woman with box of frozen fishsticks and want my two hours back."

I honestly can't understand why critics loved it so much and why this film won so many Best Picture awards.

The Shape of Water is a fantasy/romantic film. It's like watching Disney's The Beauty and The Beast in live action with a different setting. The story is awful (a mute woman falls in love with a captured beast/alien), the plot defies any kind of logic (what kind of army lets some janitors mopping around in the high security room where their biggest and top secret asset is stored?), the characters are annoying AF and their decisions are utterly stupid to say the least.

I have to say Sally Hawkins steals the show with her acting (even though her lead character is written to be as bland as the rest), and the 1960s period setting fits the film perfectly. But it's not enough to save this mediocre (at best) movie.

The Shape of Water is one of a very few movies that I regret watching due to hype. If this film is worthy of winning so many awards, then Micheal Bay's Transformers movies should dominate the Oscars and win at least 10 Academy Awards every time a movie's out."

And my intuition did not fail, Shape of Water is boring, weird, and overly-sweet all at the same time.

To start with the good things - visually it's well-filmed and the 60's are stylishly presented. It's nothing ground-breaking, but overall solid. The second good aspect are the actors, everyone plays their roles convincingly. I would point out Michael Shannon in particular, he proved that he can be a great antagonist before, and he's done it again, I was actually rooting for his character throughout.

However, the story is a dull bizarre mess. To begin with, it is overwhelmingly unoriginal - the sheepish sugar-sweet lonely protagonist, the captive creature that is tortured instead of being communicated with, the army man antagonist. The movie is just a drag, and everything is as predictable as it can be.

Now I can buy the ancient overused trope about the protagonist empathizing to some captive intelligent creature, but explicitly having sex with it? And yeah, there's actually plenty of unnecessary nudity (Shannon shags his wife. Ok.) and allusions to the creature's ****. Well, whatever gets you that Oscar, I guess. I mean I'm no prune, but in my opinion nudity is justified when it helps to convey some point and flesh out the story. But this, this just looks like Del Toro's sick creepy sexual fantasies brought to life. Sorry, but my suspension of disbelief just doesn't cover the ""woman gets turned on by slippery scaly aquatic monster"" thing. What's your next move, Del Toro, a movie about furries?

To add to that, there's an absolutely redundant meaningless side plot about a gay old man failing to hook up with another guy, and couple of scenes dedicated to showing that Shannon's character has a sexual fetish for silence. That's when you thought this movie couldn' get any more creepy.

And since we're at it, I would really question how realistic it is that some random cleaners are allowed access to classified assets in a top-secret research facility. There's also an uncomfortably stereotypical black woman who overcompensates for the muteness of the main character, never managing to finally shut the hell up. Also at one point the movie has a musical number in it, like in some Disney flick. That was also the moment when my facepalm intensity peaked. Yeah, and isn't this merman's design very reminiscent of some sidekick of Hellboy in Del Toro's own movie? Pathetic.

So, as they say, best movie my ass. I've recently also watched ""Three Billboards..."", and it's miles ahead than this trash."

The critics **** me into seeing ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" and as with that movie, ""The Shape of Water"" is blunt in its insistence that tinkly fantasy interspersed with jarring scenes of gore is refreshing and significant.

No spoilers here, but it wouldn't matter; there are no surprises. I won't fault a film for lack of originality if it's otherwise rewarding to watch. This was not. By the predictable end, contrivances and pacing had worn away whatever sympathy I'd felt obliged as an audience member to try to feel for the characters.

I made the mistake of reading reviews, hoping to find some insight into why movies like these are so celebrated critically. But professional critics, in real publications, seem unable to write positively of these sorts of movies in anything other than a prose matching the grandeur of the ""lush visuals"" therein. It's as though a sea creature's spiny appendage pierced through their skulls and deposited a sense not only of the film's significance, but of their own.

I'd give it a zero, but some acknowledgement will go to the effort put into the stagnant, boring visual compositions that critics love (and which I don't care about, but take skill to achieve, I would assume), and to the actors for keeping a straight face."

Though the acting is fine, however nothing so exceptional, the movie to its greatest detriment suffers from poor structure which absolutely minimizes its emotional impact.  A good director would have restructured the novel.  Instead this neophyte stays faithful because he has no balls.  The cheap video look chosen delivers a made for TV movie (not the good kind), and even worse are the quick news style zooms which is the first thing a total amateur does in trying to make a film; or what many veterans do under the total fallacy that it makes the audience believe in the reality on screen more.  I saw a phony let's play make believe production from start to finish.  And so much has been made of the movie's limited locations and the difficulty in crafting a compelling story within such confines.  Firstly, that is misleading to what is actually the case here.  Secondly, this little movie was of course infinitely easier to make than so much other grander, more logistically difficult fare was.  That's a fact.

Boycott the Oscars not for lack of diversity (an absurd lie by the left, the record of their choices over the many years clearly speaks for itself), but for sheer incompetence in shamelessly falling for **** content over actual quality of movie-making."

Después de ver la nueva película de Nuri Bilge Ceylan, ""Ahlat Agaci"" (Official Selection Cannes 2018), me decepcioné y molesté con lo que la gente hace con el cine a veces. El mérito que la gente le da a la película se encuentra en el dialogo, el cual conforma todo el proyecto. Pero mientras unos ven una extensa e importante conversación que revela la angustia existencial hacia los valores y acciones tomadas por los varios ""roles"" que conforman a la misma cultura que afecta y forma al individuo, yo veo una fallida intención de explicar la serie de posturas indefinidas que conforman a la cultura ignorante y vacía con la que luchará la voluntad de un sujeto igualmente confundido y que, al final, el mayor atributo de su viaje es que ""aprendió"" que ""solo sabe que no sabe nada"".
Hay certeza en la existencia y se basa en la información, pero si lo sustituimos por una sutil y pesada intención de convicción, entonces no habrá resolución. ""The Wild Pear Tree"" ignora eso y se convierte en una conversación sin argumentos, conceptos definidos, acuerdos o conclusiones, que le da permiso a sus personajes de defender una postura poco informada y muy sesgada que simplemente se deja a la deriva de la atención de la gente con poco habito de reflexión. Visualmente no existe una menor intención de poética y congruencia entre tomas. Hay drásticos cambios de calidad de imagen que se pueden ver entre cortes, una falta de cuidado en la corrección de color o, mínimo, mostrar el panorama de la historia de forma sensible. Las actuaciones simplemente se encargan de conversar con elocuencia el dialogo que representan. La intensidad dramática solo se presenta en 3 min. de las 3 horas que la película hace soportar a su público.
El cine no solo puede ser más que un vórtice de incertidumbre mal producido, sino que también tiene que promover el valor de la voz y el propósito; no de voces ignorantes e intenciones incompletas cuya resolución sea la rendición.

After seeing the new #movie of Nuri Bilge Ceylan, “Ahlat Agaci” (Official Selection in Cannes 2018) I got disappointed and mad with what people makes with cinema sometimes. The achievement that people gives to the film it’s found in the dialog, which builds up all the project. But when some see an extensive and important conversation that reveals the existential anguish towards the values and actions taken by the several “roles” that conform the same culture that affects and forms the individual, I see a failed intention of explaining the different undefined postures that conforms the ignorant and empty culture with which the will of one subject, equally confused, will fight so, at the end, the major attribute of his journey is that he “learned” that “he only knows he doesn’t know anything”.
There is certainty in the existence, and it’s based in information, but if we substitute it with a subtle and heavy intention of conviction, then there will be no resolution. “The Wild Pear Tree” ignores that and becomes a conversation with no arguments, defined concepts, agreements or conclusions, that permits its characters to defend a poorly informed and very biased posture that ends up adrift to the attention of people with little reflective habits. Visually there’s not a minor intention of poetic or congruence among the takes. There are drastic changes of quality in the image between cuts, a lack of care in the color correction or, at least, in showing the landscape in a sensible form. The acting simply is responsible of making an eloquent conversation with the scrip that they represent. The dramatic intensity it’s only shown in 3 min. out of 3 hours in which the movie makes it’s public to sit through.
Cinema can’t just be more than a vortex of uncertainty badly produced, but it can also promote the value of voice and porpoise; not of ignorant voices and incomplete intentions which resolution is rendition."

Presque une ""comédie musicale"", oui presque, car si personne ne chante dedans, le film entier est un festival de chansons et le leitmotiv bien entendu du personnage principal, conducteur autiste mi-rain man mi-kévin.



La 'chance aux chansons' donc (!), des mélopées ringardes à s'ouvrir les veines, de la musique de merde non-stop : putain, j'ai les oreilles qui saignent ! surtout qu'elle gueule à qui mieux mieux et qu'il est rare dans le film de ne pas entendre cette chiasse à longueur de plans.

Le film n'est pas un désastre pour autant, grâce à de belles poursuites en voiture et quelques fusillades, plus une poursuite à pied bien fichue en bonus. La réalisation est dans l'ensemble correcte, parfois presque agréable, d'autres fois un tantinet suspecte mais ç'aurait pu être pire, alors on ne fera pas la fine bouche plus que nécessaire.



A part un trou d'air dans le premier tiers, le rythme sait ensuite rester soutenu jusqu'à la fin avec quelques doses de grand spectacle.

Main character precocious, never-I-smile young man with incredible (read: unrealistic) driving talents. “The girl” has no other quality except for her looks, but hey, we were all young once. Other characters (cardboard cutouts, more like it) are either stupid or sociopaths. Totally unbelievable plot, expanded beyond its meager realm of possibility in the first 3 minutes. All just an excuse to direct a few exciting car chasing scenes, last of the Mohicans I presume, since the self-driving ones are upon us. Movie is a tribute to the lost art of using a clutch, which most Americans don’t appreciate anyway, and a glorification of gun violence, which most Americans appreciate all too well. Music is too loud, and too widespread in its provenance to be memorable or exciting (who in their 20’s or 30’s has even heard of first Queen album?). With so much directorial drifting from stylish parody to serious dark movie to Bonnie and Clyde tragedy-drama to Shawshank-like redemption, the film did not even had a remote chance to be a decent one.

It seems Awards are now given out to sell a trendy moviemaker or a ‘product’. ‘Salesman’ is a vague, dreary movie in every sense – now this can be a good component if used to its full value but, this work is centred around an incident that happens in a very scant time – so scant, that all the elements that make up the largest percentage of the overlong story are left wanting, as in, hardly believable or full of obviously undeveloped character motivation and situations. Seems this is all award-winning works now need...a grim situation, overblown to look stronger than the writing actually sets up. Add to this a background reference to a literary classic (“Death of a Salesman”) to suggest this work must also be intelligent by association but, that ‘association’ can equally be seen as a highly questionable metaphor. The situations that make up the sum of this movies scenario are somewhat pretentious and far from worthy of such high praise (as many other worldwide viewers have clearly noted) Performances are routinely good but the material is just too thin to last the dismal distance. If you’re inclined to think Awards must automatically represent high quality you may be satisfied – conversely, if you see awards as 40% quality and 60% promotion you might join others among the disappointed."

I never want to see another film from an islamic country because i do not want to legitimise their daily, aggressive actions and symbolisms that declare male superiority over female and islamic superiority over 'infidels'.

The two leads, Shahab Hosseini and Taraneh Alidoosti, play actors appearing in a stage show of Arthur Miller’s “Death of a Salesman” and are shown at the theatre performing in front of audiences. Why? I don’t know, except maybe to give the film a title, as it doesn’t seem to have anything to do with the film or what takes place. Yes I can give a farfetched explanation regarding the famous line from the play, “Attention must be paid” but that is farfetched!
The film opens with the couple having to move because their building may collapse and sets up for the assault that takes place and brings in a character, Babak Karimi, an actor who works with the husband and wife in the play who may or may not be the assaulter. Also the assault may or may not have included ****.
There were a total of 5 seconds that aroused my interest in the film; the first being where, because of Iranian culture where the movie takes place, a character in the play is suppose to be in a revealing negligee the actress is fully dressed and the second is when someone is slapped unexpectedly.
“The Salesman” runs a little over 2 hours and you can find better things to do with those 2+ hours."

Seriously though, I don't think I've ever seen a movie try so hard to lay out it's social commentary in such an explicit and undeniable way so quickly. It's all just surface level racial stereotype type stuff too, just the typical modern leftwing racial tension stoking. The actual directing and cinematography is not that good either. It honestly feels pretty low budget. Other than the opening ""stay woke"" song, the rest of the musical soundtrack also had me cringing as it all felt very soap operay at times, especially when layered on top of the poor cinematography. The whole movie has a ""made for TV"" feel to it. Most of the acting is mediocre at best, however Daniel Kaluuya did a great job in his role as he always does. That chick from 'Being John Malkovich' did a pretty good job as well. Unfortunately it's the material these actors were given to work with that is the problem. The writing and dialogue are very poor. This is what happens when a writer's main objective is to force ""the message"" to the forefront to this extreme a degree, the potential for actual interesting dialogue and story telling gets put on the back burner and ultimately discarded. As an old school classical Liberal, who wants to strive for a post-racial society, this movie was a chore to sit through. Could be argued this movie is pro-segregation propaganda. The main metaphor is that white people manipulate black people into giving up their ""authentic blackness"" and conforming to ""whiteness"" (whatever the hell those two things are). This movie is a paranoid fever dream for the racially obsessed so-called ""anti-racists"". I'm sure Robin DiAngelo and Kendi love this movie. They probably watch it on a weekly basis. They may even put it on every night to lullaby themselves to sleep. I'm assuming all the praise for this movie is for purely ideological reasons coming from people in that ""anti-rasict"" ideological camp. Very horrible and cringy movie, on multiple levels. I usually try to be pretty objective with my scores and this movie is in all honesty probably a 2 in reality but my classical Liberalism bias is bumping it down to a 1. ""Stay woke"" y'all!!!"

The only reason critics are praising this is to not get called a racist and to avoid being swept away by the wave of ""Oscars so white."" It would be refreshing AND TRULY SURPRISING for a black film maker to make a movie, any movie, where the central theme wasn't racism, now THAT would be noteworthy. I won't hold me breath.

Daniel Kaluuya is like flirting all the time in the movie because of the way he looks other actors.
the lighting and the colors which used in the movie was more of a rom-com lighting than a horror movie. all those pale blue and soft sunshine was not scary at all. the whole time you watching the movie the director is telling u there is something bad gonna happen for the main character and guess what?? it will! what I'm saying is there is absolutely no suspension. many may say this movie was good because it was different and there were no ghosts, monsters or other stuffs and it was all with every day objects. okay it was but, duh! not any real thing is scary! I mean look at the ""it follows"". the great underrated movie of 2014. or even ""don't breath"". these are different too. but the thing that made ""get out"" so special for critics and overrated was the fact that, get out was about BLACK PEOPLE and RACISM.

2175,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/get-out/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,gogogo21,"Jun 3, 2017",3,"Contrary to the many takes and reviews that this movie has received, this movie is neither enlightening, fresh or most importantly, entertaining as a whole. The most dissappointing aspect of the movie is that the director actually succeeds in capturing the proper mood of eeriness that hooks the interest of the audience when watching a movie of this category. Unfortunately, the movie crashes and burns when all the pieces start coming together - or rather does NOT come together. The symbolism comes hard and heavy, and many audiences will already know the racial undertones that the plot conveys.  It is actually solidly acted with all the actors going full bore into their respective characters, and the story creates the mood of off kilter discomfort very well when it comes to the interactions between the straight laced protagonist and the surrounding cast.

However the movie devolves into a series of illogical missteps that completely undermines the intent of the movie. Nothing is more dissapointing than seeing a movie start off with great promise and anticipation for a satisfying conclusion, than to see it totally fall apart at the wheels no sooner than the start of the second act, and this is precisely when this movie loses its appeal completely.

Serious, possibly thought provoking situations foreshadowed at the start of the movie break down into outright buffoonery more akin to a Wayans brothers Scary Movie plot. One particular development is a shark-jumping moment that makes the movie go from psychological thriller to full on science fiction. Many of these twists and the direction that the movie goes into seem to have been to make a symbolic or overt social commentary, something I understand is a point the film is attempting to create. However, the method is clumsy and ridiculously heavy handed. The most disappointing part is that the commentary is on point - but the sacrifice made to story, plot and logic is so insulting to the audience that the imagery is dulled to an afterthought. Many guides to the hidden meanings of this film exist, but as a movie watcher, should we really need to have a guide book to a story in order for it to make any semblance of sense?

I am fairly harsh on this movie because it is one of those films where the initial plot is interesting enough to capture you, you invest your time to learn more, and the result is a slap in the face. You feel cheaply tricked by the time the end credits roll. Most importantly, the subject matter that this movie explores deserves quite a bit more than this schlock."

Just made me want to leave the theater. I felt cheated of my $15. My husband and our friend felt the same. This film is transparently symbolic: how alien a black guy feels in the middle of white people, how much violence there is in society, how the white people have the power, control the blacks, and entertain clichés about them, and so on. Guess who's coming for dinner was so much more subtle! And it was fun.  Nowadays it looks like a young filmmaker needs to put violence in his film to be noticed because people got desensitized.

Guess who's coming to dinner? It's a black man coming home to a rich suburban white families house for the weekend, and despite their black servants, they're extremely nice to their daughters new boyfriend, too nice, something weird is going on. Yes, something weird is going on, only Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is too stupid to realize it! He's so deeply in love with his girlfriend of all of four months, that not only can't he see what's going on right in front of his face, but he doesn't try to talk to her about it, he doesn't try to investigate any of it, he just sort of goes with the flow. People are raving about this noir thriller, when it is one of the most poorly written films I've seen in a while. Major plot holes aside for the moment, there is absolutely no character development, no chemistry between the actors, and worst of all they don't even reveal the main plot until twenty minutes before the thing is over! Yes, it's weird, yes, something is going on, but the writers don't even hint at what that is! They don't even give us a chance to figure out what it could possibly be. At first it was interesting and I was hoping there would be clues to help us figure out what might be going on, that maybe Chris would find evidence or over hear something, but no such luck. Maybe there could have been a scene without him, that gave us some insight, there was absolutely nothing until the very end, when it was all thrust into our faces and even then it really didn't make a whole lot of sense. Without giving anything away, they never answer the fundamental question, why black people? I never liked traditional noir, but at least most of the time the acting is good and you have some idea of what's going on. This film is just one big circle of confusion and to be honest with you, aside from some terrific comic relief, I hated every minute of it."

Unfortunately it completely dissolves into sheer ridiculous contrived silly nonsense and tries to go black humor which while understandable undermines the thriller aspect.
Good thriller or horror movies have the very difficult task of being original and impactful yet not going too over-the-top, something the great majority of these kind of flicks fail at nowadays and most now making them probably don't even care, which is why they aren't really any good!

The dialogue is disgracefully ugly, most of the characters are thinly written and generally unlikable, and the narrative and themes critics are calling ""subversive"" and ""satirical"" are too conspicuous and on the nose to convey the sort of subtlety that marks great films of the genre.

I was no popular girl and I did have social anxiety in middle school but the main character is a whole **** show. Kayla (main girl) literally just spends the whole movie-making references to her stupid youtube channel where she gives ""advice"" while not being able to take any of that advice herself.
Kayla has close to no consequences for her actions except for when she almost gets ---- (4 letter R-word) by a highschool boy. Kayla is an unlikeable character and at some point I wish something eventful would happen, but no. Her YouTube channel is incredibly tryhard to relate to the youth but it's clear Bo Burnham had no idea what he was trying to do with the movie. I'm still being graceful and giving it 2 stars for effort.

Unfortunately, the themes that the filmmaker claims he was trying to depict don't come through as clearly and pointedly as he contends. The approach is so ""slice of life"" that it's difficult to grasp what he was really aiming for. Overlong, woefully unedited sequences of incidental events, the inclusion of beautiful but basically pointless nature shots, excessive use of gimmicky time-lapse photography and a dearth of meaningful insights from the film's subjects combine to make for a production that leaves the audience wanting, as well as wondering what this film is truly supposed to be about.

On the + side it does leave you with a bit of feeling nostalgic for what may have happened for you in real life but only because you are saying to yourself ""thats not what it was like in a punk club i the 80's"" at the screen.  It has smudges of Linklater's touch that you might have wanted when you sought out this film to watch.  The major problem out of many is Its full of cliches borrowed from the movies and its  not based on any reality.  its like a commercial for an adolescent fantasy for what some kids older brother may have been doing in the 80's based on the bulls**t stories he overheard him tell people to impress them. At best It gives you the feeling you are watching a teen sexploitation film from the 80's that ran on hbo on a loop so you got used to it and liked it because it reminded you of when you were 12 and that film was always on.  None of the college age characters look their age. Every single woman is a babe who's purpose is to be chased for sex or is to deny sex to the men.  I dont mind that their is no story because thats what linklater is able to usually pull off ( a kind of moment in time without the annoying hollywood narrative overdrive). I can't remember a single character's name and had a hard time remembering the differences between them. It was an effort to listen to them talk about what they cared about or to care about them at all.  Every setting is a film set that has no basis in reality. If this movie was in a different genre handled by a different director these overly fake sets, settings and wardrobe could be seen as forced on purpose to make a point about Americas love for its idea of itself.  But this isn't that genre or type of film or the point at all.  The poor directing, casting (not the actors performances but their obvious age discrepency) art direction, props and wardobe are not serving anything but to make a really insulated limited film in the same way a tv commercial or music video is made simply to sell one emotion and associate it with a cheap product that needs to fly off the shelves fast.  I would love to see a filmmaker who criticizes hollywood and Americas addiction to its fake narratives about itself make a response to this type of cliche factory that is Everybody Wants Some.  What would it be like if Paul Verhoven made this film with these same terrible choices the way he did with Starship Troopers to mock hollywood while making hollywood,  thereby, both succeeding in the genre while simultaneously mocking it and the audience for buying into it. Or it would be great to see a dark response to this cliche filmmaking with a film by Michael Haneke or Von Trier showing the destructiveness of these boring cliches being forced down our throats over and over. Everybody Wants Some has a few charms if you do the work to extract them from its horrible media cliches.  This  film is not nostalgia for anything that can be believed to have happened in real life its simply a post card from bad 80's movies about bad 80's college movies and it feels like a commercial about that post card.   Shallow dead pop with little entertainment value in dialogue, sequences or events of any kind."

That said, there is not a lot of character evolution over the course of this film, and thus not much of a point beyond everybody’s trying to get some [one critic actually asked “some what”? well, not character evolution].  It’s disappointing that Linklater would be satisfied with such a blatantly hedonistic work, an ""Animal House"" for a new generation looking back at an old one.  (One of the movie’s small pleasures is the re-creation of a 1980-era disco--along with a cowboy bar and a punk club.)  (Best-made case for the film: Dan Kois in “Slate.”)"

It's not that autobiographical coming of age memoirs are a problem.
It's not even that entirely unknown casts are tasked to carry plotless narrative.  ""Dazed and Confused"" was good, and ""American Graffiti"" is a classic.  (Actually both had some plot at least.)
No the problem here is a well intentioned writer/director instead of making a movie for an audience, lazily slapped together a half ass scenario expecting his cherished memories to hold up for the rest of us.  The music is great, but its use is utterly uninspired.  There's attention to the fashions, styles and props of the time.  No attention whatsoever is paid to good story craft.  There is not one memorable line of dialogue in an endless stream of non-stop banal talk, with incessant intended humor that is never funny but always needlessly raunchy, long soft edged sloppy unmotivated scenes, sluggishly slow pacing, not one minute of suspense (yes even in comedies you need some), and zero visual style.

Linklater is a longtime director working in a variety of genres and notable for exploring offbeat subjects and is highly commendable for his strides in innovative techniques.  I've been following him all along.  However between ""Before Midnight"" (Absurdly over-rated cringe inducing eavesdrop on a long, dull bickering middle aged marital conflict in real time with no sense of cinema evident), then ""Boyhood"" (Not terrible, just obscenely over-praised!  Amazing original idea regarding how to make a movie does not translate necessarily into a 'good' movie'!) and now this thing… that following is over.  He's worked long and hard to get to this point where he can probably make whatever he wants now and the financing within reason will likely be there for him.  That doesn't excuse this terribly deficient effort or the powers that be for financing it.  Not that it cost anything to make, the production value is near as low as it gets.  Again that's not the problem, an excruciatingly boring self indulgent whack off with no regard for the audience is.  Any audience!
To paraphrase from it, ""Just because some pages were filled in and cameras rolled doesn't make it a movie!""

Yet it gets a pass by the worthless sheep next door purely because his name is now on their predictably dishonest pretentious list of do-gooders.  The stooges are so incompetent or corrupt they destroy any vestige of integrity left in their so-called profession."

I'm not against remakes, it's always interesting how a familiar story will be shown from the other side.  But, alas, the fact that I was familiar with the original did not play into the hands of this film. And this is not only because the main plot twist did not come as a surprise to me.  The director simply did not reveal the characters enough to make the motivation for their actions look compelling enough.  As a result, their reaction to what is happening in places looks too affected. The picture is certainly very beautiful, but it does not cover the rest of the cons. Park Chan-wook definitely went too far with erotica, turning into light pornography, that you involuntarily begin to be embarrassed by what is happening on the screen - this transition is so swift. It would seem that the film should talk about love, how pure and beautiful it is, that it can literally save a person.  And so it would be, but the emphasis on sexuality and inappropriate humor does not make the right impression.

Contradictory to the average neanderthal that gives this film something above the yellow numerical spectrum, I propose that we come face to face with facts; Black is King is a compilation of music videos in which the artist ironically presumes her luxury in a film about poverty.

QT’s latest indulgence is all about his one-way fixation with the ‘60s. At 160+ mins it’s a long trudge but the script probably only had few pages if compared with other movies of this length, why?... So many scenes are made up of shots of bods getting into cars, then long internal shot from back seat (lifted from the far better  Gun Crazy’ 50s) then bods get out of car, long shots of feet walking, more bods get into cars, more long internal driving shot, bods again get out of car, more feet walking. This format is repeated from beginning to end –pages of same--  The 60s heralded in a new low for movie making – features like; ‘Beach Blanket Bingo’, ‘How to Stuff a Wild Bikini ’, ‘Sergeant Deadhead’ were playing as main features across the land, el-cheapo’s had become the new norm. What would usually have been a ‘B’ picture were now being sold as an ‘A’. Yes. it may have helped a jaded Hollywood at that time but what about other mainstream audiences?

So, what might have influenced TQs fixation with this downturn in the social morays of movies? Tarantino grew up in the swinging ‘60s/mod‘70s working in a porn cinema (this perhaps explains his addiction to perversity) including a video store - while also watching the endless re-runs of TV shows, along with an overflowing barrage of low budget, Spaghetti westerns that had flooded the market - thank goodness some audiences grew up (well, some did) and demanded better.  These endless ‘homage’s to days offering little more than cheap TV-style quickies  --now being released to the big screen --- with product that was generally catering for a guideless, acid tripping youth (such as the Manson crew, etc) wanting endless simple-minded partying. Hollywood producers loved it – now, for half the normal budgets, they were getting the same financial returns as quality features. QT has simply revived those days and a new ‘comic book hero’ generation have picked it up. Only this time around, the budgets are BIGGER while the contents remain juvenile, if not ridiculous. Trouble is, too many of today’s producers and art critics also grew up in this overly comfortable, ‘anything goes’ era, so they wrap on about the glorious emptiness that’s making them all rich. Some rave about the cinematography and design - with that much money being thrown about it's simple to ‘copy’ the work of previous Masters. But, no matter how expensively dressed-up and stylishly packaged rubbish maybe, it’s still rubbish (but, GOOD-LOOKING rubbish). Too much you might be saying? Take a look back, revisit many of those poorly scripted, badly acted, TV shows and movies of the 50s-60s – the ones Q.T. tends to dote **** may be surprised how your memory may have failed you as just how poor most were.  Once U.A.T.I.H. looks like several proposed projects that never got off the ground all edited into one, and doesn’t do justice to any of them. One or two characters and situations looked as if they may have been leading to something but simply fizzled out. How long might it take before more look back and ask, how were we so fooled?  Or is it just that LESS has now become the new MORE?

So, if this is **** 9th may there be only one left to go. Please  (if we must that is)"

The problem, of course, is that #9, ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"" is not actually a movie.  I'm not sure what it is.  It has characters.  It has dialog.  It has things that hint at suspense and the possibility of some kind of action happening at some future date.  But it doesn't seem to have much of a story.  Anecdotes, yes; story, not so much.  And frankly it isn't really what I would describe as ""entertaining.""

It's more like what I would describe as a shaggy dog story, which **** defines as ""a funny story, traditionally about a talking dog, that, after an often long and involved narration of unimportant incidents, has an absurd or irrelevant punch line.""

The key phrase is ""long and involved narration of unimportant incidents.""

You could skip most of the film and just catch the last 20 or 30 minutes and you'd get as much out of this as I did.  Or just imagine walking into a Manhattan art gallery.  On one wall is an image resembling Andy Warhol's stack of Campbell's Soup cans.  Only instead of soup cans it's cans of Green Giant peas.  You stand there staring at those cans of peas for 161 minutes.  Do you get anything out of it?  Well, I guess that's for you to say.

Personally, if Tarantino ever comes out with #10 I think I'll re-watch I Claudius, or Key Largo, or Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead, or even Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse.  Those were movies (even the mini-series among them), rather than shaggy dog stories or practical jokes."

Pero el desarrollo de la película es horrible, son escenas una tras otra sin un muy buen hilo que conecte la trama que se estanca en su intento de homenajear. Leí a alguien diciendo que la película ""revoluciona la forma de hacer un guión y contar una historia en el cine"" y que por eso era mucho mejor que Parásitos, una película mil veces mejor desarrollada que el montón de diálogos sin sentido y el desarrollo hueco, lento y aburrido de Once...
La tuve que ver en dos partes por lo poco entretenida que es. La familia Manson es como una excusa para que uno piense ""en cualquier momento se va a desatar la violencia estilo Tarantino"". Creo que si en lugar de ser una película hubiera sido una serie el resultado sería grandioso. Pero en cambio llega esta mezcla rara que solo se salva por sus actores y su recreación de la época.

My favorite Tarantino movie is Jackie Brown, because it had a plot, warm characters, humor and a perfect resolution in the end. ""Once upon..."" has none of that. It's brilliantly shot and visually works as a Hollywood timepiece. But apart from that, it is just dull."

About the ONLY good thing about the whole thing is his depiction of Bruce Lee which is by far the most accurate thing in the film.

Its hard to fault the actors for this one because the performances from the cast were  mostly solid across the board. They simply could not hold together one of Tarantino lamest visions for a film to date. The whole production would have been at least a 7, but the writing from plot to dialog was so weak it easily drug it down to a 3.

Of course, as usual, the ten-star advance ""user reviews"" here are from people who ""mysteriously"" have never written a Metacritic review before--i.e. studio shills. But ""Booksmart"" has gotten great early reviews, and several people I know who saw early screenings really did love it. So I went in fully expecting to enjoy it, and was dismayed when immediately--I mean, even before the opening title--the film was making ""Funny, huh? Wasn't that funny?!?"" noises despite nothing particularly funny happening. I'll give Olivia Wilde points for making a very colorful and energetic movie that might indeed convince a lot of people through sheer high spirits that it's a great comedy. But instead it felt just strenuous to me, trying too hard to cover the fact that the funny, clever, witty material wasn't actually there.

The premise is ridiculous--bookworm protagonists are horrified to discover that after all their sacrifices for the future, all the party-hearty types at their high school ALSO got into Ivy League schools. This would make sense if it took place in a wealthy community where everyone was a ""legacy"" student thanks for their family's donations. But the movie makes a point of singling out two characters as the only ""truly rich"" ones here. Those two, like every character save the two lead girls, are complete ""SNL""-style caricatures. What's worse, they all also seem to be played by actors who are about a decade too old, once again apart from the two lead girls.

Even so, the premise and the casting and everything might have worked if ""Booksmart"" were an outright farce. But it seems to be aiming to be sorta-kinda ""real,"" while the characters nonetheless behave like no teenagers past or present. Everything here is so over-amped and contrived for effect, yet the ingenious comedy situations and bright lines that approach might have served are nowhere to be found.

Like I said, I don't get it--it's a very lively and well-crafted movie that nonetheless felt completely phony and unfunny to be. It's not boring, but I have no idea what people who like it are responding to, beyond the fact that ""'Superbad' for high school senior girls"" is probably good enough for many. But I liked ""Superbad"" well enough, and this movie just did nothing for me. You could say it aims for a mix of ""Superbad"" and John Hughes, but those movies do a much better job turning recognizable teenage life into farce with some heart, and if Wilde intended something similar (I'm not sure what she intended, beyond punching across every scene as if she might never be allowed to direct again), she misses the mark. A for effort, C for derivative/uninspired content, and D for over-effortfully trying to hide that empty content. It's like a student paper with a very splashy cover but nothing original or thoughtful inside."

I can only imagine the writers concocting this story with one message in mind: make these characters quirky and also one dimensional. 'Quirky' is all they have going for them which makes them boring. Sure, there are messages of female empowerment yet it does nothing to propel a meaningful story. Tell a story. Come on. Here, each character broadcasts an over the top persona that is difficult to relate to. Initially, I liked that the one girl had a crush on a skater girl. Yet, we know nothing about her within the first forty minutes of the film. All we know of these highly educated outsiders is they are outsiders. That's it. Each scene only fosters a certain stereotype that is exagerated to the point of dullness. Slut girl acts like a slut. Dumb guy acts dumb. Rich kid acts rich. And the two friends are just two friends who find out the people they looked down on are actually goinst to prestigious schools. Wow, twist... So what is their motivation? To party. That's it? That's it. The whole wants vs. needs of screenplay writing 101 does not even happen here. They want to prove to people they don't care about that they can party as well. I mean, if the beginning of the film sets these two up as individuals who could care less about what others think of them, why would this matter? Their only character trait is they are indifferent to the opinions of others. And that is **** because the movie needs to happen. These are screenplay ideas running around as supposed characters and nothing else. And on their journey they meet other purposelessy strange characters. There have been wonderful female friendship films with fleshed-out, wonderful and quirky characters. Think Romy and Michele's High School Reunion. If you want female empowerment and self-awareness, look no further than the seminal Thelma and Louise. I have loved three seasons of Glow on Netflix mainly because the writers care to build on the dynamics and relationship of the characters. But I could not make it through this forced and over the top film. I didn't laugh. I rolled my eyes as it felt like this film had the concept of something interesting and fun without actually following through on it."

It seemed as if they took the concept from, ""Superbad"" and tried to make it original with lame humor and cheap, tasteless jokes. The main characters lacked on screen chemistry as best friends, perhaps do to their acting ability, especially Beanie Feldstein. It's blatantly obvious why she got casted into this role; her brother is Jonah Hill. If you're not aware, Jonah Hill stared in ""Superbad,"" where his character was the controling, self centered friend. It's not ironic that Jonah Hill's sister, Beanie, plays the exact same role/character in this movie.

I can't stress enough how much this movie is a rip off of, ""Superbad, "" even down to the plot. It's the same plot from the film, where two friend's friendship gets tested on a adventure trying to get to a party. In conclusion, this movie should be avoided. It's a Netflix film at best. It's a film you watch when you finish watching the full series of ""the office,"" and you can't decide what else to watch. I can't understand why this film got high ratings. This film didn't do well at the box office, and it seemed to go under most people's radars. I'm certain why this movie got overlooked for one simple reason.

synopsis

The story follows Dever and Feldstein's characters, two academic superstars and best friends who, on the eve of their high school graduation, suddenly realize that they should have worked less and played more.

I love Olivia Wilde, especially her performance in Drinking Buddies.  I was really hopeful about her directorial debut.  This comedy is not funny.  There is no timing, no flow.  The base premise, that these nerds want to party when they realize everyone else in their high school also got into amazing colleges while partying and screwing off, is silly, of course.  But the flimsiness of it, especially because of no follow up, was sad.  We kept waiting to laugh, but every performance was so stilted and every character so stereotyped (the over-the-top, effeminate gay theater boys, come on), we chuckled mildly once.  After an hour, we walked out.  We don't do that.  It also made me think it may be a generational thing.  But I really don't think so. We love these coming-of-age stories, from Superbad, American Pie, Clueless, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, even American Graffiti.  This was just unfunny and bad.

I hope Ms. Wilde gets another shot at directing.  But I really hope these ridiculous critic reviews don;t go to her head.  Look at the mixed viewer reviews.  When critic/viewer reviews are so misaligned, something is not right"

I actually had free admission; after it was over, I wanted my money back.

The film's whispered, sing-songy narration is an incoherent mess. Anderson engages in an intellectual name-dropping that's calculated to impress the type of person who desperately wants to be well-rounded but doesn't like to read. She quotes David Foster Wallace and Kierkegaard and Wittegenstein - though I'm sure she's really quoting Bartlett. What she quotes is devoid of context and, of course, depth. I suspect her greatest intellectual influences are actually the hits of acid she dropped back in the 1970s, or perhaps the pamphlets she picked up from the airport Krishnas.

She refers very liberally to the Tibetan Book of the Dead, the one work I'm sure she's read. I suppose the film is meant as some kind of personal essay; if so, it has no overarching argument. It's more a pastiche of totally disconnected musings. If you pepper your conversations with phrases like ""getting locked into your thought flow,"" then this film just might be for you. For me personally, as she flashed words onto the screen with pictures of snow-covered trees, YouTube-style videos of her dog, and then tried to connect it all to 9/11 and the national security state, I began to wonder: am I being punked? Is somebody filming the audience right now? Is this film the abomination that it so clearly appears to be, or is this supposed to be a comedy?

""Heart of a Dog"" is self-indulgent, excruciating New Age garbage. Instead of wasting your time on this monstrosity, do the following: watch a short film by Maya Deren; go to ""The Intercept,"" and skim an article chosen at random; search online for ""cute dogs,"" and play whatever videos pop up; and finally, go re-read the terrible poetry you wrote when you were in sixth grade.

Woody once said that it doesn't matter how much they're played with, and what matters is that they're there for their owner when they need them. and yet here we are at Toy Story 4 where Woody completely ignores that quote he did back then and decided to leave Bonnie, leave all of his friends behind, just to pursue a new life with Bo Peep as a ""lost toy"". And now that Woody's with Bo in the end, he's not there anymore for Bonnie when she need him. the fact that Bonnie still grabbed Woody and played with him in one of the camping scene is still evident that Bonnie might still need him. and Woody left his responsibility behind, and that means leaving all his friends behind too.

Every film brings on the most heartwarming moments to memory, as it's usual to Pixar. Sadly, Toy Story 4 is easily the worst film ever made by Pixar, as it brings such a heartbraking ending and instead of the fantastic and joyful feeling that surrounds every teardrop that usually falls while watching Toy Story 1, 2 and specially 3, its is now filled with a sad, gloomy feeling that makes me feel grief everytime I watch it.  I felt it like an enormous disrespect to the characters, specially. The animation is top notch. The writing is fluid. But while Toy Story 1 to 3 hold a very special place in one's heart, Toy Story 4 feels more like a wound that demands you to grow, overcome pain and deal with sad truths. It is still an important animation, nevertheless; but the way it was made can hurt people who grew up with that fantasy so much that the score has to go very low.

Toy Story 4 é minha fraquia de animação favorita. Cada filme traz os momentos mais comoventes de que se pode lembrar, como é comum para a Pixar. Infelizmente, Toy Story 4 é o pior filme já feito pela Pixar, por trazer um final que tanto corta o coração e ao invés do sentimento fantástico e alegre que permeia cada lágrima que comumente cai enquanto se assiste Toy Story 1, 2 e especialmente o 3, ele é agora preenchido por um sentimento triste e depressivo que me faz sentir uma espécie de luto toda vez que assisto.  Eu senti como um enorme desrespeito com os personagens, especialmente. A animação é a melhor possível. O roteiro é fluido. Mas enquanto Toy Story 1 a 3 têm um lugar muito especial guardado no coração, Toy Story 4 é mais como uma ferida que demanda que você cresça, vença a dor e lide com verdades tristes. Ainda é uma animação importante, apesar de tudo; mas a maneira como foi feito pode machucar tanto as pessoas que cresceram com essa fantasia que a nota precisa cair bem lá embaixo."

Think you're gonna see some classic Toy Story action? Oh boy, you would be wrong, this movie is just a cold, shallow reminder of the disease-ridden, **** oppressive, racist and unequalized **** society we're living in today that is covered by a mantle of good manners and political agenda, this piece of **** is just another reminder of how **** up this world is today and that nothing is sacred anymore. The first ones were great, the first one gives you a lesson that you should accept the way you are and not try being something else, the second one gives you a lesson on life that you should never leave your friends behind and if someone tries to **** you over you'll have your friends beside you, the third ones leave you a lesson that not everything looks the way it is, and you should dig in deeper, and that some people will still be hostile to you, doesn't matter how good you are with them. And this one? It just leaves you a ****ty lesson that you should be a pricked dumbass ape that should take a bullet for every single dumbass you meet in the entire world, and that you should leave everything you love because a woman, really, Woody is the biggest **** i've ever seen in a movie. He's no longer an optimistic cowboy that is self-aware of himself and enforces leadership and order between the toys and teach them from their mistakes, he is now a dumbass who will leave everything behind because M'FORK or M'LADY, they dumbed him down so much it's a ****ing insult, his intelligence is the equivalent of an online White Knight (Someone who stands up for girls on the internet they barely know, hopefully so they can engage in sexually intercourse with them. Usually males. They are **** who can't get none in real life) and in the ending when he leaves everyone behind feels so wrong and forced-in that i'm positive this movie is just trying to do political agenda, they basically killed Woody, this was the worst way possible i've ever seen on a movie to kill such a famous, important character that influenced in millions of people's lives. It was atrocious, it should be a ****ing crime, it didn't make me cry, it was pathetic, stupid and pointless, and it even wasn't for a ****ing good reason! Just because an uninteresting, generic and bland porcelain doll character that appeared in 2 scenes and wast lost for over 7 years before this movie and weren't even that important! She was just shown in a scene kissing Woody and that's it! Also it was ****ing pointless! Woody stayed with her just because she was too comfy in that Park she was living in or something! He left everything behind not because it was for the greater good, or for something that was remotely worth such a stupid decision! He died just because a woman, and that's why i couldn't take the ****ing ending, it means you must leave everything you knew, loved and lived behind because you must fulfill the request of a woman and the need of having a sexual intercourse to presumably be worth something! And that's what pisses me off! This movie leaves kids the lesson that if a woman calls them they must leave everything behind, and i ****ing hate that! Women aren't queens or godesses or superior beings! They are normal people that are no better than you or me! So what this people is trying to screw in your skull is that if you want to be worth something in this hostile and cold reality you must die for a woman, because if you don't do that you are worth nothing, and that is the most bull**** thing there is! You can be an excellent person in life without the need of having a woman or any other kind of sexual partner beside you. And the plot of this movie feels extremely forced (In a scene Woody says ""I have nothing left to do"" and that resumes the whole purporse of the movie). He doesn't get in trouble because he made a mistake, or has to save his friends, the movie starts because Woody, like the pricked idiot he is, suicide dives himself out of the window because of a stupid, deformed, suicidal, worthless piece of trash Forky decided to do a favour to the world and kill himself. It makes no sense. Why would he do that? He knows his kid loves him, the relationship he made with his toys, himself knowing that he is a rare collection toy that is worth thousands of dollars, and the nice, happy life he is living with all of them, yet he decides to risk throwing it all away because of a suicidal piece of trash jumping out of the window. Also why star Molly as the main character and not a better one like Rex, Potato Face or even Jessie? They are much better and meaningful characters, also the new characters are lame at best and doesn't contribute anything extraordinarily good to the plot, what a waste of Keanu Reeves. And what other reviews mentioned is the lack of screen time they gave to the original cast and how bad they dumbed Buzz down, i'd like to keep going, but i can't."

2367,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toy-story-4/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,TrevorsView,"Jun 26, 2019",3,"A beautiful continuation of a dearly personal saga perhaps was predicted by some, except others foresaw Disney’s evil scheme to bank on nostalgia, knowing their recent horrible case of sequel-itis. The latter ones correctly guessed the fate of Toy Story 4; nothing unique comes from this bland half-attempted corporate product.

But first, here’s a little backstory about how Toy Story came to be. The entire franchise began with Pixar’s first Academy Award win: Tin Toy, in 1988. The studio then got the idea of expanding this short into a feature film using their successful innovative technology, focused on the main character, Tinny, and his ventriloquist dummy friend. Eventually, Tinny became Buzz Lightyear, and the ventriloquist dummy became Woody. Now, the friendship between this cowboy and space ranger stands as a testament of how even drastic differences, whether in people or filmmaking techniques, can coexist in sincere harmony and cooperation. Except now, all that is forgotten, leaving most Pixar fans to potentially hate this contradiction against what was set up in the past on a toy’s purpose to be loved by a kid. Woody understood that, Buzz understood that, now, neither one cares. The messages left behind instead are nothing consistent with the good ol’ cowboy.

Bo Peep returns, but for the supposed purpose of fan service to SJWs’ (Social Justice Warriors’) desire for an “independent, no man necessary” archetype designed to erase the motherly shepherdess from existence. Before, she kept Woody’s moral hat on straight as the sole mature toy in Andy’s room, and now, strips away the skirt to declare how nobody means squat to her anymore. How exactly is Bo a good role model in that regard? For being able to throw a kick? Woody shows a similar negative role model for boys minus the drastic change in exterior. The only change in appearance he undergoes is the “Andy” on his boot, which has “Bonnie” written on it instead now, except it leaves no impact on Woody’s choices later. Remember when the “Andy” on Woody’s boot sadly got painted over in Toy Story 2? That sense of ownership and commitment to a kid means little to Woody here, leaving room for his selfish desires to be fulfilled out of not being chosen for playtime.

Even the designs of these returning toys are way off compared to past movies. There is a flashback of Andy, and he looks like a totally different boy, while Bo Peep’s face has grooves around the face rather than the original painted-on face. The animators clearly didn’t try to make them match the original designs, nor did the screenwriters try to make them match the original characteristics. Buzz Lightyear is disrespectfully demeaned to a painfully unfunny running gag, and it doesn’t help either that he survives a fatal fall in a busy carnival that should have broken him beyond repair. Although to its credit, the Historic Downtown Grand Basin dummies are fantastically created humanoid nightmares… the eyes… the mouth… the run… brr!!! So, if only looking at the new characters, the designs would be brilliant.

But the characterizations of these new faces would still be insufferable, even if these new cast members try sincerely to compensate the horrible script. The villain is a doll named Gabby Gabby who wants Woody’s voice box, because it apparently works inside her. (Yeah…) The way her arc closes is entirely pointless, rendering Gabby Gabby a weak antagonist. The little screen time of the Canadian biker, Duke Caboom, benefits the plot only by providing a jumping platform, that’s it. The insufferable duo of Bunny and Ducky crack tough brawler improvisations nonstop, including an ongoing joke which halts plot progression.

Now, to explain why “You’ve Got a Friend in Me” doesn’t apply here. Woody’s old friendships just wander around wild without enough information on what the living situation in Bonnie’s room is like. It’s conveyed that Jessie frequently wears Woody’s “sheriff” badge, but that’s it. There needed to be more focus on Forky, Bonnie’s new toy made from trash. That unique concept to the series gets thrown aside, so its huge narrative potential never exploits itself. Instead, an entirely different tone takes over at the antique shop, where its showcase of photorealistic lighting takes priority over character conflict. Although, Forky’s humor is cute when he takes center-stage, especially when running after a trash bin over and over, to Woody’s humorous desperation to stop him. If the rest of the movie kept like the first act, it’d be on par with the other movies.

Instead, once closer analyzing the filmmaking mechanics of each scene, including the now completely recycled Randy Newman score, the rainbow adventure of Toy Story 4 loses credibility, as it should. Dang, why didn’t we listen to Chucky’s promotional posters of him massacring the toy gang? He was trying to warn us!"

I wasn't expecting a jump scare gory blood bath horror flick. I knew what type of movie I was getting myself into. That said, this movie was still dreadfully boring and had very little payoff. It barely had anything enticing about it except for the final 10 minutes, although even that was quite predictable. It was a historically accurate period piece sure, but was it entertaining horror?

Well, except for that one really disturbing scene that everyone is saying made them uncomfortable. And it does, im not gonna lie, but so would filming a roadkill squirrel for ten minutes while maggots its its intestants(that's not in the movie btw).

So, instead of trying to extract some sense of this horrible movie, I spend the rest of viewing time trying to spot a smudge, a smear, a hay in the hair, a bad tooth, a dirty nail. Nothing.

I was sitting with my wife and cousins and they would jump higher than a horse even if they saw a lizard. No one even moved an inch during the entirety of this awful, torture of a movie. I have my share of creepy atmospheric horror but this one missed the mark by a distance. If you compare it with the Blair Witch Project which set the precedent for movies which were based solely on the atmosphere it created this one has nothing. They showed the witch or whatever she was very casually, goats were haunted or something and I dont know about sundance audience but goats arent scary to me. Nor are beautiful witches living in the middle of a jungle. Keep away people and save your hard earn money and time to better purposes like watch a real horror movie.

You'd expect a movie containing witches to be very mysterious and creepy and this requires subtlety to execute - there is none. It's in your face, silly moments like the witch appearing and cackling that renders it devoid of subtlety - just look at The Blair Witch, totally creepy despite not actually seeing the adversary.

Worse still is that you will miss at least two-thirds of the dialogue, since it is mostly whispered in a weird, made-up dialect that has been poorly recorded. The film is being pitched as true-to-life, based on actual folk tales. But the resulting mash-up is pointless -- other than to provide diabolically gruesome scenes of death.

One of the themes is memory.  At the end the villain is reformed by giving him new memories by an entire village working together.  I'm a VFX and stop=motion nerd and even I cannot fathom this convergence of stop-motion and CGI animation.  The facial animation rivals anything we have seen in 2016 from the major effects vendors.  Several astonishing character flourishes and responses are attempted--and pulled off.  Really remarkable for any animation let alone stop-motion.

The professional, typical critics must be bought out or deprived of their senses because the movie is boring. I fell asleep once. Went back to rewatch and make sure I didn’t miss anything and still trash script. This movie tries too hard to impress you with a long monologue and long dialogues. Poor character development. Nobody cares about these long scenes using old technology. Show us for a second, then move on. Would have been nice if they did some flashbacks instead of literally showing us black screens with audio over it, ridiculous. If the producers wanted to tell us so much about the movie they should have made a damn podcast. We go to the movies to see, not stare at blank screens. They focus to much on telling us about what happened as opposed to showing us. Don t waste your time."

They set out to discover the mysterious presence that's looming over their small town. While I can appreciate the director's period approach peppered with subtle modern techniques, it seems there's more interest in the style of the storytelling than in creating a compelling experience.

This again proves you may be able to fool some of the people, some of the time. I’d suggest the producers, B.F.I., Amazon Studios, etc, would have lost considerable sums of money with this pretend movie. As this overly convoluted maze progresses it makes you wonder how Joaquin Phoenix and other cast, managed to keep a straight face (might have been interesting to have seen their faces while they read the script) At times it looks as if the editor and director threw some footage in the air and spliced it together in the order it landed – then, attempted to copy Kubrick during one of his worst moments.  In one scene, Phoenix jumps into a country lake and proceeds to endlessly sink into the deepest abyss (a-la Atlantic Ocean) who makes these foolish ‘technical’ decisions? The graphic violence (whether on or off screen) is as off-putting as the snail pacing and lack of worthy script - what sparse dialogue is uttered,  is so poorly recorded and articulated most is unintelligible. Director/screenplay writer Lynne Ramsay has to shoulder much of the blame for this morbid failure to connect with a thinking audience (in preference to appealing to a nebulose, artsy bunch). While there may have been some stylish photography much of it looked like the operator forgot to turn off the camera between takes – with someone then thinking it looked so trendy they used it several times over. Mostly for those who want to read more into each scene than is articulated on screen or simply want to justify what they ‘think’ they understood, otherwise, a miserable experience that stretches its 85min R/T into tediously grotesque boredom and wastes a Phoenix performance."

As soon as I got home I went to read some reviews and only if I give spoilers to explain what some of them saw and I didn't could I explain my puzzlement.

I went to see this movie only because Joaquin Phoenix is in it (and the 2 stars are for him) and I believe he is a very underappreciated actor by the general public but, justifiably, is appreciated by the critics. Though I never understood why he is the mess he is--that is NOT a spoiler--in his performance, you can see he is a tortured man and I could give you a dozen guesses as to why he is but there is no way that I could validate even one after seeing the movie. You can see and understand the few, very, few tender emotions he shows in one scene with his mother and another with a young girl.

There is a lot of violence, destruction, terror and blood in this film both on and off the screen from guns to hammers to knives to physical hand to hand brutality.

I don't know nor understand the director and writer Lynne Ramsay's reason for this movie and/or what it is about but I was impressed by the movie's score by Johnny Greenwood which at times, when needed, loud, booming and provides rhythm to what is happening.

But not before we suffer with lots of lingering personal moments and confusing flashbacks.

Maybe I am getting old and jaded, but this was a shallow movie whose only points have already been made so many times and so many better ways (i.e. see Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead for a funny take on pointlessness or even Lowery's own TV show Rectify for an example on futility) that it really had no reason to be made. If Lowery wanted to explore a story about the endless lives of ghosts, he should have concentrated on the details of their day-to-day existence, and let the audience extrapolate that into hopelessness.

It's not amusing or funny but it's a damn good scene but besides those two scenes the rest is pretty much fairly dull and mostly boring and it's a film that drags and drags for long periods and feels too long. Daniel Kaluuya's character was excellent and his acting was the best in the whole film in my opinion and some characters in the film felt weaker than watered down vodka and some of the acting was pretty bad.

""worldwide gross of $19.6 million, against a production budget of $42 million."" This move is barely making half its production value. Also i will say i saw this movie for free, it was long and drawn out and left a bad taste in my mouth. I would have liked to have gotten a refund but i cannot get my time back."

Because they overvalue writing, they overvalue character development and they overvalue leftist political ideology. Jerky non sequitur scene choices and pacing for a full hour to start the movie? Very bad first half of this movie folks there is no way around it. The second half is better, ....could have been a good heist movie and character study. Instead it falls flat in too many places. Watch this under perform at the box office. Luckily audiences can spot a loser if critics cannot."

Nothing but bad fiction story, do not file under drama."

One suspects that she should have made this remark to director Steve McQueen a lot earlier. The subsequent 20 minutes do nothing to redress the balance and the film ends up a long and pretentious dud demonstrating no 'GO' whatsoever.
The cast do their best with Davis demonstrating one pained expression after another and Elizabeth Debicki providing eye catching support. However, it is Robert Duvall who really brings his few scenes to life as the retiring politician disenchanted with the political path being taken by his son (Colin Farrell). McQueen seems to be better at handling more complex/important issues in films like '12 Years a Slave' and 'Shame'. His direction here is as slow as a tethered tortoise lacking any urgency or pace that the genre requires. The routine screenplay doesn't help and the movie ends up feeling messily truncated in many scenes, although at nearly 2 and a quarter hours tighter editing would have been a welcome relief.
The final heist is an almost insignificant let down and the film on the whole is a major disappointment. Also what is it about Daniel Kaluuya that has critics reaching for superlatives? His appeal definitely eludes me! The best thing about this misconceived enterprise is the end titles song by Sade called 'The Big Unknown'. On this evidence the film deserves to remain just that!"
