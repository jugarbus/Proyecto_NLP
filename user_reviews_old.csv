10,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/parasite/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,ryansmith512025,"May 4, 2025",10,"Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece ""Parasite"" deserves every accolade it has received. The directing is absolutely flawless, with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the film's themes of social inequality. The way Bong uses vertical space to represent class hierarchy is brilliant - from the cramped semi-basement of the Kim family to the architectural marvel of the Park residence. 

The script is equally impressive, seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary. The dialogue is razor-sharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced, with shocking twists that never feel contrived. The way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to Bong's exceptional storytelling skills.

What elevates this film beyond mere social commentary is how it refuses to paint its characters in black and white terms. Both families are sympathetic yet flawed, making the inevitable collision all the more devastating. I give it a perfect 10/10 - a true modern masterpiece that rewards multiple viewings."

13,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/parasite/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,drqshadow,"Sep 24, 2024",9,"A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naïve, white collar household.

Unpredictably composed, Parasite shifts effortlessly between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in deep breaths, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, the inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.

The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."

A watermark for modern-day suspense that combines social commentary, cringe comedy, and nail-biting tension in ways that are exhilarating and unprecedented.  The cast is terrific, with Song kang-ho, Park so-dam, and Cho yeo-jeong all standing out as highlights.  The script is razor-sharp, with every set piece and character decision leading to jaw-dropping results.  The Kim family is sympathetic, but their actions often veer squarely into anti-hero territory.  Bong joon-ho is a master of his craft.  There are some shots in this movie that belong in a museum, including one framed mostly in darkness near the end of the movie that will take your breath away.  The pacing is perfect, with every ounce of tension mined from each scene until the consequences of the Kims' actions comes to bear.  Run and see this one, and get ready to be wowed."

Dort trifft er seinen 16-jährigen Neffen Patrick (Lucas Hedges), den er schon Jahre nicht mehr gesehen hat und jetzt soll er sich um ihn kümmern. Der Film zeigt in mehreren Rückblenden die Geschichte von Lee und wie er so geworden ist. In Manchester trifft er unter anderem seine Ex-Frau wieder und dessen neuen Freund.

Manchester by the Sea ist ein trauriges Drama. Der Film thematisiert den Umgang mit dem Verlust von Familienmitgliedern. Lees Geschichte ist sehr traurig anzusehen und es ist nachvollziehbar, warum er so geworden ist. Die ersten zehn Minuten sehen wir ihn in Boston, wie er seinem Job nachgeht und er schüchtern ist und Probleme dabei hat neue Leute kennenzulernen und dass er ein Alkoholproblem hat. Ich finde Lee, trotz seiner Probleme sympathisch und kann mich in ihn hineinversetzen. Die Beziehung zwischen ihm und seinem Neffen geht auf Distanz, weil er Angst hat, noch jemanden zu verlieren. Der Soundtrack ist überragend, vor allem in den emotionalen Momenten. Casey Affleck hat zu Recht den Oscar als bester Hauptdarsteller gewonnen. Der Cast generell ist super ausgewählt und man kann jede Figur nachvollziehen. Manchester by the Sea ist ein schöner, emotionaler Film, welcher einen berührt und über die Familiensituation nachdenken lässt. Der Film zeigt, dass es schlechte Familien gibt, man sich trotzdem ändern kann.

9/10"

Featuring a great script and outrageously natural acting, this movie possesses absolutely no schlock, pulls no punches, and sacrifices balancing its mood in favour of displaying unprecedented levels of existential cruelty.

Though this movie possesses a certain subtle beauty in its narrative, at its core, it generally depicts a cynical apathy that is punctuated by the loudest kind of bitter suffering. The beauty lies within its bleakness, which can make it as powerful as it is difficult to watch.

While not a movie with general appeal, Manchester by the Sea's bold display of uninterrupted pain and suffering is laudable, and is worth watching for those who can manage to bear witness to the on-screen cruelty it often demonstrates."

‍ The beauty of the visuals, the clear visual language, the outstanding performances, and the deliberate staging evoke not just cinematic painting but infuse the entire film with an almost unbearable tension. Or rather: the feeling that something will end before it has even begun. I can recall only a few films that have conveyed this feeling so profoundly to the audience.

 Initially, I had to embrace the formal, almost rigid staging, look more closely, peek beneath the surface—just like with a painting, where hidden emotions only reveal themselves through active observation. What is shown, and what is left out?

Directed by Raoul Peck and narrated by Samuel L. Jackson, the film presents vast amounts of archival footage from the civil rights era, juxtaposed against modern day representations of racial conflict, in which both the past and present are contextualized by the words of writer James Baldwin.

Given that the source material is nearly 40 years old, many of Baldwin’s thoughts and opinions on the black experience in America ought to feel dated, yet the overall feeling leaving the theater isn't about how far we've come, but how much farther we still have to go."
60,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-am-not-your-negro/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TVJerry,"Feb 18, 2017",8,"James Baldwin was a distinguished black writer and an outspoken critic of race relations in America. There are elements of a traditional doc in this film, but it's more an artistic treatise using Baldwin's eloquent words (quietly voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) and charismatic on-screen appearances to delineate his musings on the subject. It's supported with disturbing historical photos and excerpts from Hollywood films. There is a focus on 3 great leaders of the civil rights movement (Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King), but the extended analysis sometimes becomes repetitive or seems to ramble. Even so, this is a forceful examination that sadly still rings true more than 50 years later."
61,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-am-not-your-negro/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Feb 10, 2017",7,"(Disclosure--not full: I met James Baldwin at the 92nd Street YMCA in NYC just after his second book ""Giovanna's Room"" was published and he was participating on a panel for what was very rare at that time talking about gay sex, black men and women in the 1950s none of the  3 related to each other. At that time he was friends with Marlon Brando and Wally Cox and I had lived next door to the former and when he saw me he hugged me and asked me to join them for  a bite to eat afterwards. For awhile I became part of their circle though I certainly was on the outer circle!)

With all that said after he went to live in Paris I didn't see him nor when he came back so I didn't know too much about his last book that wasn't finished when he died and Director Raoul Peck decided to make this documentary using Baldwin's words, and public appearances, to finish the book.

James Baldwin knew Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Junior, and all 4 men, in the 1970s, wrote and spoke about events that took place many decades before and, unaware, all talked about events that are taking place today.

""I Am Not Your Negro"" is an in your face look at race relations in our country from day one until today and though it is Oscar nominated it would be better seen on HBO or PBS or showed in classrooms for all ages.

I do hope whoever sees this will be lead to the readings of James Baldwin's from his ""Go Tell It On The Mountain"" to ""Giovanni's Room"", ""The Fire Next Time"", ""Notes Of A Native Son"", ""Another Country"" just to name a few that will have you entertained, moved, educated and intrigued."

The singing is undoubtedly great and its nice to see the atmosphere in the small, church, venue - its quite infectious even, although, obviously, in a good way!. The songs are quite atmospheric and I'd be surprised if you didn't find yourself tapping your toes to the various catchy tunes, such as 'Mary, Don't You Weep', 'What A Friend We Have in Jesus' and the titular 'Amazing Grace'. The picture is slightly grainy I suppose but then, of course, this was recorded some time ago and I guess you could say it adds to the sentimentality/nostalgic aspect of it. I thought it was a bit of a shame that there's no additional information about the singers life given alongside the performances - I suppose I assume that music documentaries will include more than 'just' the music itself but that's not to say that it's not a good, uplifting, entertaining and enjoyable musical performance because it is. I suppose I think of it more like a concert film than a music documentary as such. In any case, she certainly had a pretty amazing voice and she made the most of it.

85,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/amazing-grace-1972/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MarkHReviews,"Apr 19, 2019",9,"“Amazing Grace” is a revelation.  That this documentary even exists is a miracle.

In January, 1972, a 29-year-old Aretha Franklin recorded a live gospel album.  Over two days, with the help of Rev. James Cleveland (himself a well-known gospel singer), the Southern California Community Choir and the studio musicians who had helped make her the Queen of Soul on Atlantic Records, Aretha recorded at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Watts, Los Angeles.  “Amazing Grace,” the resulting album, became the best-selling gospel recording of all time.

The songs selected for the album, and indirectly the film, are an eclectic blend.  They include traditional gospel hymns, a mash-up of Carole King’s “You’ve Got a Friend” with the gospel tune “Precious Lord,” Marvin Gaye’s “Wholy Holy.”  With my Baptist upbringing, I was literally sobbing throughout “What a Friend We Have in Jesus” and “Amazing Grace” – with Aretha in full flight, the choir in full-throated response and the audience in rapture.  In fairness, my wife, one of the more empathic souls on the planet, was completely dry-eyed and found the film “an interesting anthropology lesson.”  So your experience may vary.

Sensing that something magical was about to happen during these recording sessions, Warner Brothers studio (which owned Atlantic Records) hired director Sidney Pollack to document the proceedings.  With five cameramen, he recorded every moment.  The result was over twenty hours of audio recording and over 1500 video scenes, including shots of Mick Jagger standing, clapping and singing (the Stones were in LA to record “Exile on Main Street”).  The structure of this documentary is quite bare-bones. There are almost no side conversations, no voiceovers for context and no interviews with any of the participants.  This austere structure allows Pollack and his crew to focus on the most important task – capturing Aretha singing at the height of her powers, often in extreme close-up.

Now on to the miraculous part.  Presumably because they were filming and recording a live performance, Pollack and his crew never “slated the scenes” (using the wood clapper to mark the beginning of the upcoming scene).  In 1972, slating the scene was the only way to accurately sync 16mm video with the audio, which came from two different sources.  After months of effort, including hiring Choir Director Alexander Hamilton for $200/week to lip-read some of the video, producers decided this problem was insurmountable.  The project was abandoned and the materials shelved for decades.

In 2007, Producer Alan Elliott purchased the raw footage from Warner Brothers, unaware of the syncing problem.  Fortunately, what was impossible in 1972 could by then be conquered through digitization.  However, because the tapes had sat in a basement unattended for over 35 years, they first had to be “re-baked” (literally placed in an oven and heated to over 130 degrees) so they would not disintegrate while being digitally processed.  The finally-synced footage was edited into the final version of the documentary by 2015.  For reasons unknown, Aretha then sued to block release.  Only after a screening for Franklin’s family following Aretha’s death last year did her estate eventually allow the film to be shown publicly.

So, this documentary is forty-seven years in the making, but wow, was it worth the wait.  “Amazing Grace” – how sweet the sound!"

However, while the picture is somewhat typical of concert films of the day, it comes across as somewhat amateurish by contemporary standards (unfocused cinematography, choppy editing, inconsistent sound quality, etc., material quite surprising from a director like Sydney Pollack). See it for the Queen's superb performance, but don't be disappointed by the rest of it."

Abandoning the more experimental themes he toyed with in Inception and Interstellar, Christopher Nolan has set out to make a mostly-straight war picture, shining his spotlight on a major test (and ultimate turning point) for the British armed forces. Told from three entangled perspectives - one each from land, sea and air - we see heroes, victims, cowards and lunatics emerge from what might have otherwise seemed a nondescript group of frightened young men.

Dunkirk is far less bombastic than the standard combat film, with a soft, observant character and distinct lack of extraneous dialogue. That reticence, paired with an emphasis on beautifully-composed photography, reminded me more of an art film than an action epic. The battlefield's thick tension is inescapable, though, always drawing us back to the moment, with the wary skyward eyes and skittish, shell-shocked nature of nearby soldiers proving a constant reminder that arbitrary death could be mere moments away. It’s also the rare positive example of a recent tendency toward uneven sound mixes: a barrage of gunfire or sudden, screaming airborne bombing run can pack a mighty punch."

Whereas audiences were entering theaters expecting to be greeted with the next Saving Private Ryan or Platoon, they were exposed to an onslaught of the senses; overwhelming human conviction, the pressure of time, Nolan writing it as its own character, and the realistic deption between navy and civilian. 

And boy oh boy was I happy to be surprised! Nolan crafted not a tale, story, or insight into a tiny aspect of the war. But successfully detected a literal experience, not telling, showing, and dramatizing what happened but simply depicting the events that unfolded while emphasizing the already very enticing literal events that unfolded at Dunkirk. 

By using simple yet effective plot devices and strong characters Christopher Nolan did not craft a film but an experience of what was. 

Dunkirk should be seen at least once by... well... simply anyone."

The film is about a man who receives a letter that a body has been found in a glacier and it is that of his ex-girlfriend, who died in a freak accident during his youth and her body presumably lost. This sets off a chain of events that shakes this 45 year marriage to the core. Rampling's character then begins to question everything she knew about her husband and how deep his love for her really is. Especially when he begins to reminisce of his past love and she comes to the bitter realization that she isn't the true love of his life and never was. It's a very bitter film and you can't help but sympathize for her character every step of the way."

This little British romance-drama was not expected by everyone. Without Charlotte Rampling's Oscars nominee for the lead role, it would have been an easily forgotten. Because it is very slow, the story is just okay, but the performances are the saviour IMO. At this age, Charlotte Rampling was looking so good on the screen, her youthful costume was maybe the reason.

The story of a long married couple, the whole movie takes place on the eve of their 45th anniversary celebration. A week to go for their big day, the wife discovers some hidden secret by her hubby. While digging it only gets bigger, but how it would affect their present relationship was told quite interestingly. It was only a single perspective tale, so the detail on the other side are not briefed to us that well. But everything was quite understandable.

In some relationship, some secret needs to be left untouched for good, only if it is not hurting anybody. Life is a long journey if you're an old and to look back your path. What happened a long time ago is not to be judged for the in between timeline events. In someone's perspective, some past incidents are fair. The beauty of this drama is simply lies how smoothly narrated this complicated issue between a husband and wife. Because even if you're not a regular movie goer, still you can name a couple of similar titles, but how unique this was when comparing with those is that's where it betters. It was not so good, but much better in many ways, in its own way.

I thought about The Big Short over the course of the following week to see if I could understand the housing bubble better in my head, I thought about how Room made me feel while I was falling asleep that night after I saw it, but I've thought about the last 10 minutes of 45 Years more than all of the Best Picture Nominees combined. This was one of those movies that lingers in your head so much, The Cranberries could have written a song about it. Let me preface, this movie is only 90 minutes, and the first 80 are so incredibly slow it's like you're being forced to watch How It's Made  in High School P.E., but boy does it pay off. The ending of this movie punches you in the gut with so much futility you'll think Gone Girl had a happy ending. I will also preface this movie is not for people who disapprove of sad endings, this movie can only be described as ""Soul-crushing."" Also, don't bring a date if you want the relationship to last. Couples should have at least 10 years of bliss under their belt, or be confident enough to claim they're the next Niles and Daphne Crane.

Picking  one central character, played by Charlotte Rampling, and having Tom Courtney's grieving husband secondary lessens the depth of the movie. She is shown as the victim, while he comes across as self centered, which makes his grief shallow, thus trying to force us to pick her as the aggrieved one, where in reality both stories deserve our respect. Rampling is very good as the emotions cascading inside her broil under the surface while she struggles with the ever expanding revelations that devestate her."

I, too, go to 50-100 movies a year, most of which we ""screen"" through Metacritic overall scores, unless something else draws us. For example, Woman in Gold was rated orange but we love Helen Mirren and we loved that movie.  My wife is more sensitive to movies like 45 Years than I am, and there were times in the early stages of the film, I sought more ""action"".  That ultimately was naive on my part.  My wife understood the nuances, particularly of Rampling's understated performance far better than I.  I love the Platters, and when ""Smoke Gets in your Eyes"" played, I hummed along instead of carefully listening to the words.  When I got home and googled the lyrics, WOW!  The more reviews I read that night and thought about the movie (I couldn't STOP thinking about it), the more I loved it.  So, do NOT miss this movie and go to it with an open mind, watch very carefully (remember the movie Sixth Sense, and how you had to wanted to watch it again to understand how you could have missed the clues?) or you will miss much.

This cartoon is about one girl’s emotions, her name is Riley. And the main hero is Joy, the happiness in this cartoon. 
Riley grows up and can’t control her emotions. She decided to leave her parents. Will she come home?
Although this cartoon has a difficult meaning, I guess for children “Inside Out” will be an incredible dive into the world of emotions. In my opinion, a mature person can notice critical information and comprehend references in a plotline. 
I recommend this cartoon, especially for watching with family. I guess everyone finds something special for themselves."

155,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-la-land/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,davidlovesfilm,"Oct 20, 2024",10,"""La La Land"" is a visually stunning, emotionally evocative musical that blends classic Hollywood romance with modern-day sensibilities. Written and directed by Damien Chazelle, the story follows Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a passionate jazz musician, as they navigate their dreams, careers, and relationships in Los Angeles. As they pursue their artistic ambitions, their relationship faces both exciting and painful challenges. The movie utilizes a backdrop of vivid color palettes, romantic locations, and jazz music, and captures the dreamlike but realistic highs and lows of juggling both love and success.

The genre of La La Land is a modern musical, drawing from the traditions of Hollywood's Golden Age, such as the dramatic romance and breakup seen at the end of Casablanca, while incorporating the sensibilities of contemporary cinema. While it is an original work, it shares thematic and stylistic connections with his last film like ""Whiplash,"" another film by Chazelle which explores the sacrifices required for artistic greatness. La La Land is not part of a series or an adaptation, but it reflects some nostalgia for musicals while telling a fresh story.

Emma Stone's portrayal of Mia is filled with sincerity and relatability. Her arc—from struggling barista to aspiring actress—strikes an emotional chord, and her performance of ""Audition (The Fools Who Dream)"" is a highlight. Gosling's Sebastian is both parts dreamy and stubborn, focusing on the sacrifices he makes for his music and love. Chazelle's direction is successfully able to bring these elements together, combining musical spectacles with emotional resonance. His understanding of both the extravagant musical genre and the human experience allows La La Land to feel timeless. While the film might feel like a reflection of classic musicals, it raises expectations, especially in its ending that is more bittersweet than a typical Hollywood romance. It’s undeniable that the film takes on the complexity of ambition, love, and personal sacrifice in a meaningful way. It’s about the tension and hardships that come between following your dreams and the realities of life, a theme that resonates with many people in today’s world.

In terms of filmmaking, ""La La Land"" swing for the fences and scores high well in almost every aspect. The cinematography by Linus Sandgren is visually stunning, with sweeping shots which reflect both the characters' emotional arcs and elevate the setting of Los Angeles. The opening scene, a large-scale musical number set on a freeway during rush hour, immediately sets the tone for the film’s playful and extravagant approach to storytelling. The color palette is constructed to evoke each scene’s mood, from the vibrant oranges and pinks of sunsets to the more muted blues and grays used in more somber moments. The editing by Tom Cross allows the film to flow seamlessly from one number to the next, without disrupting the story's emotional rhythm. In particular, the long, uninterrupted takes during dance sequences help show a sense of realism within the world of the movie. The sound design and music by Justin Hurwitz with songs by the duo of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul and are crucial to the story’s emotional depth, with the score and songs such as “City of Stars” and “Another Day of Sun” becoming memorable, almost iconic, pieces of the film.

Ultimately, ""La La Land"" is a cinematic experience that combines beautiful visuals, exceptional music, and deeply emotional performances. Whether you’re a fan of musicals or not, its exploration of relationships and dreams makes it universally enjoyable. The film’s balance of romance, drama, and music is captivating and thought-provoking. In conclusion, I believe La La Land is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates a beautiful film with heart, stunning visuals, and a fantastic score. Its emotional complexity and depth allow it to be considered more than just a simple romance, making it a memorable cinematic experience. I would highly recommend La La Land for anyone looking for a film that is both fun and also leaves them with something to reflect on. The performances, music, and direction make this film something that years from now will stand the test of time still be a highly regarded piece of cinema."

165,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lady-bird/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,drqshadow,"Sep 20, 2024",7,"An eccentric, erratic young woman seeks direction in the twilight of her high school years. Alternately addressing her need to rebel, to cast away everything she once held sacred, and to remain true to herself, she frequently acts on impulse, then later deals with the regrets and repercussions. As did many of us, during the moody, impressionable years of adolescence. She's not quite sinking, but not quite swimming, seeking a way out while also realizing how much the familiarity and security of her long-term hometown means to her.

It's a time of transition, of can't-go-back decisions, and the weight of those choices looms over both the title character and her loved ones. For the first time, the heaviness of the real world is infringing upon her, from her family's financial struggles to the slim chances of admittance to her dream schools, and it's no easy road for anyone: herself, her selflessly supportive father or her imposing (and constantly fretting) mother. It covers a lot of emotional churn and introspection in a relatively low-key way, almost exclusively through casual dialogue and dinner-table debates.

The conclusion is a bit off-putting - it doesn't end, just stops - but in some ways, that's a better tonal match than the more theatrical scene that could've been chosen a few minutes earlier. Rich and human and familiar, if not transcendent."

This coming-of-age drama sees the journey of its titular character through the final year of high school. Lady Bird's relationship with her mother is tumultuous and taut as she yearns for a better life and standing.
Lady Bird is a coming-of-age story wholly; it embodies an annoying realism on young adult themes.
Starring Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf (who steals all her scenes), Lucas Hedges, Timothée Chalamet, and Beanie Feldstein, Lady Bird boasts good performances. It's also a good directorial debut for Greta Gerwig.
Everything about Lady Bird is solid and well-made, but it doesn't transform the movie to a grand status like critic reviews suggest. Lady Bird is not a movie that's sure to elicit recommendations, but it's one you won't regret seeing.

170,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lady-bird/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,kyle20ellis,"Mar 18, 2022",10,"With one of my favourite trailers of the year, the awards attention, the theme of coming of age and the critical acclaim, 'Lady Bird' very quickly became one of the year's most anticipated films for me. Deliberately didn't see it at opening weekend though, just in case it was busy and difficult to get tickets, after the insane opening weekend of 'Black Panther'.

'Lady Bird' in no way disappointed. With the above, was hoping that it would be one of my favourite films of the year and it turned out to be exactly that, the awards attention and acclaim more than fully deserved. This doesn't just fly, 'Lady Bird' actually soars and have not seen a coming of age-themed film in recent memory this sparkling or honest or with this amount of humour, brains, heart and charm. Have seen it mentioned as a passion project, and if it was the passion and hard work can be seen all over.

It is a very appealing film visually, with beautiful and colourful cinematography and with editing that flows succinctly and cohesively. The music is has energy yet knows when to understate itself when needed. In her first film as solo director, Greta Gerwig directs with a nimble touch, the comedy is light on its feet and she avoids making the emotional elements heavy-handed or tonally jarring.

The script is one of the year's best, my personal pick actually for this year's Best Original Screenplay Oscar of the nominees. The comedy sparkles in wit and is genuinely hilarious, done in an honest and true to life way yet with some cringes like it would be in real life too. Over-sentimentality is avoided in the more emotional and dramatic scenes, there are some really sweet and poignant moments and an endearing personal touch.

Found myself really emotionally investing in and relating to the mother and daughter relationship, their bonding bringing tears to my eyes and then making me smile and laugh when botched and leaving me with hope at resolution at the same time. The coming of age/angsty elements have a truthfulness, authenticity and twinkle and it was very easy to identify with them if in the same position growing up, they're often very funny but also very heartfelt and charming.

Story is immensely engaging throughout right from the riotous opening to the more emotional and avoiding-being-too-pat ending, anchored by the mother and daughter relationship that entertains, moves and provokes thought. Didn't mind at all that it wasn't ground-breaking, due to not expecting it to be as coming of age can be predictable. Enjoyed the way the characters were written, and appreciated that the film broke away from the typical archetype of school teachers being over-disciplinary and without humour.

Performances are never less than great, with Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf fully inhabiting their characters and phenomenally. It was wonderful for both to get awards attention with both giving two of the year's best performances. Lois Smith twinkles too in her role.

If Lucas Hedges (who has grown quite a lot) and Timothee Chalamet (not as good as his truly remarkable performance in 'Call Me By Your Name' but showing why he is one of the most promising recent rising stars) continue to go down this promising path they are likely to go on to big careers.

Concluding, fabulous film and one of my favourites of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

If I have to be honest, the movie was not particularly interesting. Personally, I appreciate, that it is related to real life, maybe not only related, but also it represents the picture of most people's lives - not knowing who you are, strange relationships and everyday struggle with family members and friends, problems in school and in finding university and intimate life. So, I appreciate the focus on that. It's teen drama though. It says the movie is drama and comedy, didn't rally feel the comedy there. ""Yes, I gave that name to myself. It is given to me by me"" - that was fun haha! Anyway, I am used to teen comedies and I didn't get that movie as comedy. Somehow, soundtracks weren't enough and the script wasn't something special.

The movie itself seems to feel the same way, lingering in those sweet moments of quiet memory and cozy togetherness for as long as it can, delaying the inevitable. Of course, eventually something has to give, and then it's a crushing landslide of sudden public interest and consequence, hitting all the harder for the delicate harmony that existed, so freely, prior to the vortex.

Heartfelt and thoughtful, with a stirring message and no true heroes or villains; just people doing what they think is right, no matter how misguided that might seem from other angles."

It felt quite authentic, although I suppose I wouldn't necessarily know how such people live their lives. I found it endearing how the younger members helped each other out. There is some funny dialogue - in an amusing way, rather than especially laugh out loud. I found myself feeling quite sorry for some people, due to their circumstances. It is surprisingly thoughtful, I suppose. Overall I thought this was a very warm and charming film, which I'd recommend, especially to fans of Japanese films. I really liked the under stated nature it has. Ultimately, its a film about family love. I'd also say its quite a symbolic film."

Its not permanently laugh out loud funny but there are some pretty funny scenes and it focusses on social awkwardness, primarily for the career focussed daughter, Ines, so if you don't like cringe-y moments then this may not be for you (the comedy is sometimes slapstick in nature). Its fair to say she finds herself having to deal with a father who is a practical joker, a tease of sorts, which doesn't necessarily go down well when she's with important colleagues and clients. I enjoyed this film. I was surprised there was so much English present actually as I'd assumed it to be primarily German but there are a number of scenes featuring people representing companies who speak English, so perhaps if your curious about watching foreign language films, this is a half way house a bit, as its not exclusively in a foreign language? (perhaps a third of the film is in English, something like that) having said that, I can't not point out that it is a long watch at almost 2 and three quarter hours long but I certainly enjoyed it and didn't find myself wishing it would end anytime soon, which means its a pretty good film in my book.

188,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Reginthorn,"Mar 16, 2017",7,"I am unsure of how I feel about Toni Erdmann. On the one hand, Toni Erdmann is a film with a huge heart. The premise is simple enough to follow. Essentially, a father (Winfried Conradi), in an existential crisis of sorts, uses an alter ego in order to reconnect with his corporate-driven daughter. The corporation Conradi’s daughter works for is as stereotypically capitalistic as it gets. The film utilizes the process of globalization and corporate culture as a means to amplify the disconnect in the father/daughter relationship. The viewer gets the sense Winfriend was a hippie back in the day. Toni Erdmann often works because the characters are extremely complex. I enjoy films in which the characters exist without an explicit concern for audience expectations. Primary or secondary characters often ramble about subjects which are not necessarily tied to the main narrative. In these moments, the camera will focus on setting up characters in the background or illustrate the state of the speaker’s mind. The fictional events on screen are shown to be natural slices of life. Conradi is only predictable in that he is desperate to reconnect with his daughter, Ines. Often, Conradi as Toni Erdmann resorts to pranks in an attempt to goad out some repressed nature in Ines. Humor organically flows in the awkward situations Erdmann flings into. In short, Toni Erdmann has many moments which are pure comedy gold. The core nature of Toni Erdmann’s (the film) humor is laid bare near the film’s climax. The faults of Toni Erdmann, unfortunately, stem from some of the films’ strengths. As primarily a drama, the humor is inconsistent in where and how long it occurs. The film also allows characters a little too much breathing time. After a key moment, the camera decides it wants to follow the characters around. The argument could be said the choice aides in giving the characters an added depth towards physicality. By physicality, I mean the subtle body languages in a character. However, Toni Erdmann is an almost three-hour affair. A lot of people walked out around the film’s halfway point. Personally, I walked out of the theatre wishing the director had opted to cut about thirty minutes. Character development is at times made explicit in narrative exposition. As a result, the extra attention to body language feels a bit redundant. I might be being a little harsh due to my unfamiliarity with German cinema. Ultimately, I think the film was worth my time."

Also, you need to be patient. And in the right mood. But if you are, if you are a busy person with constant dilemmas between the personal and the professional, you will love the movie.

And at the end, she is still not quite convinced, I think, but I don’t want to include any plot spoilers. However, I think he has helped her (and us) make considerable progress toward understanding her/our own worth and desires. I guess its length is a problem for an American audience, but it is a movie like “Magnolia,” where you just have to surrender and “go with it” to enjoy it.  And I have to confess that I’ve sat through a lot of Wagnerian operas, so listening to incomprehensible German and reading subtitles is not such a shock to me. If you try to relax and enjoy it and not be judgmental (like Inez), the action and craziness will carry you along, and I think you will find it rewarding. It’s a movie I will not soon forget, both for its craziness and for its message. I actually might want to see it again!"
191,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,DirigiblePulp,"Feb 25, 2017",8,"Truly, a comedy epic. Ok, that's mostly the length of the film talking. This is a classic high-concept comedy premise that's so deeply rooted in real human emotion that it only feels outlandish on reflection afterwards.

Quite a bit has been said about the way in which the film refuses to conform to the typical route one like this would take - that of a woman finding a man, realizing she's a Type-A corporate **** who just needs to shut up and be a wife/mom, and all without ever explicitly stating that fact but implying it every step of the way.

Instead, this film meanders and wanders and roams and keeps finding ways to surprise and tickle. The jokes are long cons, ones with mostly huge payoffs. That Ines reaches her revelation both as a result of her father's antics and also her own self-realization feels especially real. What she needed was not so much a change of heart but to be surrounded by one decent person. It's the fault of other corporate cronies and sexist buffoons. It is a slight twist on the formula that makes it near revelatory. The ending eschews trite resolution, suggesting that happiness isn't magically forever after some grand realization but that it is comprised of moments and the mere ability to see that and experience that with someone you love is in itself revelation enough.

I would have preferred less slack direction in regards to the showy-unshowy ""realism"" camera work and scene pacing. There are some scenes that seem shot for no reason whatsoever and others that end abruptly or at absurdly inconvenient times. In short, it tries to be too cute with its form. I'm thinking in particular of the ending where Ines has a naked brunch (my lord when Toni shows up in that costume - haven't heard an audience laugh like that in while) and hilarity ensues as people show up naked until it ends with a well-timed hand on a shoulder. Suddenly people are putting on clothes and Toni leaves and Ines chases and there's no reason for any of it and the scene still had so much more to give. Then there's a strange long-winded follow-through in a park and a little girl and finally a hotel clerk pulling off a mask. A tighter sense of story there (and elsewhere) and we could be talking masterpiece."
192,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,LeZee,"Feb 14, 2017",7,"What do you think is worth living for?

I had tough time to figure it out what was the thing on the poster. Seeing it upside down, with mirror, name it, I used all the tricks I know, but nothing had worked. On the other hand, I thought it might be a fantasy film with a King Kong like creature. That's the curiosity it created, people to a have different opinions and forget to expect from the film. But it was a simple comedy-drama and only way to solve the mystery is to watch the film. That's what I finally did.

The opening scene was good. But I did not think the whole film would be like that. It was about a prankster and his attempts to reach his workaholic daughter, which was the entire narration. A lifetime trip for them, that's not about the challenges in the world or the nature, but their self-discovery, the meaning of life and purpose. This is one of the beautiful films to open up about a father and daughter relationship. In the grown-up world, the people forget to live the actual life, when they give all the focus to their professional life.

I have to agree, this is a competitive world and you will be replaced by millions of other waiting behind you for such opportunity. But does it all worth doing is the real question. Doubts like that won't arise without those who love us pointing it out. It needs to be asked properly, politely. But some people take an alternate route like in this film. Sometimes it ends in an unexpected adventure to just realise what they are into. And this film was honest, to reveal as much as it can in many angles.

This is the story of Winfried. An aged and divorced music teacher who makes practical jokes to people around him. After his dog died, he decides to reconnect with his only daughter Ines, who is now working in Romania. She is on the cusp to get her desired position in the office. On her one final push for that, is now getting distracted by her father. She who never understood her father's way of life, tries to get an answer out of him about the life. So that's where their journey begins. Some of the bold steps taken by them, the film accomplishes what it wanted to tell us in a unique way.

""The problem is it's so often about getting things done. You do this, You do that. And in the meantime, life just passes by.""

The film was actually loosely based by the director's own father. The writing was brilliant. It reminded me 'Infinitely Polar Bear', because these women directors inspired by their fathers to show the world how their childhood was like. The actors were amazing, particularly those two in the main roles. I liked them both equally. From the different angle, they have given different performances. There's no surprise if you liked the film only because of them.

The film had won many prestigious awards around the globe and now its biggest stand off is at the 2017 Oscars which is a few weeks away. Another Scandinavian film, which is also nominated for the Oscar, is also about an old man like this one. But I think 'Under Sandet' is the frontrunner for the golden statue. Because we all know that America's and Academy's sentimental towards the WWII.

When it comes to rating, the film is strictly for adults. It was good in the initial parts, but there are some surprise nude and sex scenes. At that time I thought it lost its path, but actually that was the turning point where you are going to witness a different half of the film. Surely many people going love the second half more than the first.

At first, it looked like it is a German version of 'The Family Fang', but only more realistic with dark humour. It's difficult to understand every scene, especially in the first watch. Because without knowing the film characters, the events involving them look casual. Capable to get the sense of humour is the key here. So if you decide for the second time viewing, you will learn more about it. It is one of those films that second time watch necessary for some people.

Frankly, I did not think it was a great film, just after finish my watch. But thinking back about all those film events, made sense. By the time I decided to write this review, I was in its favour. That's the reason I won't write about the films right away. This is a great film, but you have to focus closely and understand everything, then you will have a great time. But remember, it is one of the longest film in the recent time, particularly for a comedy-drama, yet enjoyable. Recommended!

Billed as a comedy, it is tears-running down-your-face hilarious at certain times, drolly funny elsewhere, slyly satirical at other times, sometimes just plain quirky and even squirmy-uncomfortable in places. It's always interesting, though, and maybe even brilliant. At its core, Toni Erdmann is about core values, both personal and societal; about shifting power relationships in the workplace and within families; and about a father's love for his adult daughter and his struggle to find a way to connect with her. Critics love it, I think, for its subtlety, its unpredictability, and its blending or mashing of genres: comedy, social criticism, family drama, and even a dash of weepy melodrama. Plus, the performances of Peter Simonischek as Winfried/Toni and Sandra Hiller as his daughter, Ines, are sharp and completely believable."

I’m a believer that a protagonist does not have to be likeable, relatable or a good role model. They must be understandable and interesting, and this movie checked all those boxes for me. Josh Gad is also in this movie. He’s really annoying. He plays kind of a Pee Wee Herman-style kids entertainer, but he’s really a big jerk. I feel like I’ve seen that before in other movies, Death to Smoochy comes to mind. The story is also a pretty basic zombie horror-comedy setup and execution, not that different from Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland. Nothing too original going on. However, the best part of this movie that makes it worth watching is Lupita Nyong’o as the kindergarten teacher and her class. They bring the laughs and they bring the heart!

-Trip Fontaine

Little Monsters premiered this weekend on Hulu. No, not that Little Monsters – the classic from 1989 starring Fred Savage and Howie Mandel about the monsters that live under the kid’s bed. Little Monsters (2019) is a little bit Shaun of the Dead and a little bit Kindergarten Cop.  Because this movie is already on a streaming device and “time is money”, I will tell you whether it is worth your time to stream Little Monsters.

From the trailer, you might believe that the movie is about a group of students on a field trip that gets overrun by zombies, and it is. It just takes a good 25-30 minutes to get to any of the monster action. We are transported to Australia where slacker, rockstar wannabe, Dave, is having an ongoing argument with his girlfriend. Needless to say, that relationship doesn’t end well such that Dave moves in with his sister and precocious nephew, Felix. Of course, Dave is inept and inappropriate in caring for Felix until he meets Felix’s luminous kindergarten teacher played by, Academy Award winner, Lupita Nyong’o. Eventually, the kindergarten class embarks on a field trip to Pleasant Valley Farm, which is next to a U.S. military base where some unexplained experiment is going on and going wrong. Zombies ensue.

Sure, it is a bit derivative of these other zombie comedies and other movie clichés abound. England’s character is the cliched unreliable uncle. Josh Gad plays a children’s television host, who is not-so-surprisingly less kid friendly off camera. Zombies stalk the set and crave flesh as they are known to do. The biggest savior/revelation for the film is Nyong’o. She sings, she kills zombies and she’s a delightful presence as the kindergarten teacher every 5 year-old should have. It is refreshing to see Nyong’o as the object of affection and a romantic lead here, and she has nice chemistry with England. There are some laughs here and there and some good music, if you’re a Taylor Swift fan especially. The zombies are grotesque-looking, so the makeup was on point. There are some really tense moments where you do not know whether they all will make it.

Ultimately, Little Monsters is not a must see film. If it were in the theater, I’d tell you to skip it. Since it is already on Hulu, it is probably a movie to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon, especially with Halloween coming up, even if it is just to marvel at how remarkably talented Lupita Nyong’o is. I wish she had more starring roles.

Great job, Trip! I must agree but with a caveat for the new parents in the world out there. If this came to theaters, I wouldn’t say completely skip it but it is must definitely a streaming gem. We haven’t seen a movie where toddlers are put in such peril. This movie is basically every new parent’s nightmare! For those of you with a kindergartener, I might say definitely check this out for the Halloween season, even if it’s for zombie apocalypse preparation. And for those of you looking to netflix and chill in this ghastly time of year… definitely check it out."

Kind of like a cross between Kindergarten Cop (1990) and Shaun of the Dead (2004), Little Monsters is a hilarious and unexpectedly moving piece of work. The storyline is unquestionably clichéd – a loser who cares only about himself is forced to protect others, realising he's been a **** and must change his ways (with the help **** woman, of course). We've seen this narrative template countless times before. But what's extraordinary about writer/director Abe Forsythe's Little Monsters is that he's able to create likeable characters and elicit genuine emotion from an archetypal structure (the zom-com) that seemed to be in its death throes.

Dave (Alexander England) is a man-child whose life is going nowhere. Unemployed and recently separated from his girlfriend Sara (Nadia Townsend), he moves in with his sister Tess (Kat Stewart) and her son Felix (Diesel La Torraca). Taking Felix to kindergarten one day, Dave meets and becomes infatuated with Felix's teacher, Miss. Caroline (the always radiant Lupita Nyong'o), and when a school trip to Pleasant Valley Farm petting zoo requires an additional chaperone, Dave leaps at the chance. However, an accident at a nearby US army base releases a horde of zombies, and so, trapped in the zoo and determined not to upset the children, Caroline must try to convince them that everything they see is part of an elaborate game.

The thing that struck me most about Little Monsters wasn't the zombies or the comedy, but the emotion; Forsythe never allows the humour to dissipate, constantly tempering the sentimentality. And it's a sentimentality that feels authentic and, more importantly, feels earned. Forsythe, whose son is five and has just started kindergarten, was inspired by his personal experience of anxiety upon handing his child over to a kindergarten teacher, with the zombies introduced later. This is an important point, as they're a means to an end, with no real importance vis-à-vis what the film is trying to say - which is that children can confer strength and, with their uniquely innocent perspective, offer a non-judgmental and often exceptionally perceptive view of the world.

The film's comic structure definitely has a vibe of La vita è bella (1997), with Forsythe getting a lot of mileage out of Caroline trying to keep up the illusion that everything is a game – zombies chasing people is a game of tag; the longer the children all survive, the more levels they will complete in the game; the blood all over Caroline is jam. Even funnier, at one point one of the kids complains because she thinks the zombies look too fake. The film also features one of the best sight gags I've ever seen, involving Dave and a photo of Caroline…or is it? There's also a brilliant scene involving Felix and a Darth Vader outfit, which features him trying to use the Force in a rather awkward situation, later telling Tess, ""I am your father mummy"", a line which made me laugh more than it probably deserved.

In terms of the acting, Nyong'o owns the film – her performance is physical, emotional, authentic, lived-in, and when the time comes, she's fierce and driven, with a real sense of psychological verisimilitude that renders Caroline as a believable, relatable person, complete with human fallibility. She also plays the ukulele for real, has perfect comic timing, and her singing voice is pretty damn good too.

Aside from Nyong'o, the film's other stand-out performance is a wonderfully over the top Josh Gad, playing US children's entertainer Teddy McGiggle. Introduced as a kind of hyperactive but generally affable Mr. Rogers, we soon learn that McGiggle is a cowardly, self-obsessed, alcoholic, sex-addict, who hates children and his comedic companion, a hand puppet named Mr Frogsy. And Gad has a blast digging into this litany of character failings - whether it be tearfully confessing to Dave that he's addicted to sex with single-mothers; drinking hand sanitizer; screaming at zombies, ""I f****d your mother"".

If the film has a problem, it's probably the character of Dave. We're asked to like him from the get-go, but his introductory scenes don't make it easy, as he comes across as a self-important and lazy slob. Of course, that's how he's supposed to come across, as it sets up his redemption arc. Some people, however, will undoubtedly sour to him to the point where that arc seems perfunctory, even cynically fake.

That notwithstanding, Little Monsters is a real gem - rarely have I seen a film so sentimental that avoids becoming turgid. Nyong'o grounds the whole thing, Gad chews the scenery magnificently, and Forsythe nails the comedy/zombie balance. The zom-com subgenre is almost completely in the rearview mirror, but Forsythe has been able to craft an emotionally genuine (and genuinely emotional) film that actually has something to say, and that has tremendous fun saying it."

Those involved know it and treat it with the levity in needs, working in quirky, offbeat humor throughout.

The real gems are the interviews, and they come frequently enough, though a few feel too brief. Stay for the credits gag reel to see some of the funniest jokes that were necessarily cut, as no one could keep a straight face (and viewer laughter would make it difficult to follow the entire interview)."

Overall I was pleasantly surprised with Between Two Ferns: The Movie. I was a big fan of the original videos when they came back out several years ago, but had little faith in it as a movie. The celebrity interviews are a mixed bag. While Galifianakis's character gets in some very funny barbs the interview's heavily, if not entirely, scripted feel doesn't shock due to contemporary shows like The Eric Andre Show or Who Is America. Both of which elicit a mostly genuine responses from the guests. Between Two Ferns: The Movie manages to rectify the so-so quality of the interviews by virtue of the supporting cast and Galifianakis's zany and often amusing interactions between the side characters. Other than when Will Ferrell's character was on screen, it felt like he was **** the comedy out of the room, the sub plot of the movie tended to amuse. While not every joke landed enough did and the charisma of the supporting cast and the Galifianakis (or lack there of for him) more than made up for some of these sections clunkiness. Overall Between Two Ferns: The Movie was solidly amusing and much better than I had expected from a Full length Between Two Ferns feature. I'd recommend it to anyone with Netflix needing a light chuckle especially if they're ready to feel the nostalgia when the Between Two Ferns theme plays."

They do go on the road to interview celebrities and run into various snags, but it only feigns the depth of a full blown movie, with certain key turning points, while its heart is really in its gags.

225,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/all-is-true/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"May 24, 2019",8,"As it seems only the British can do, there are 2 scenes in ""All Is True"" that are master classes in acting which would be expected from Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen but a much younger actress, Kathryn Wilder, gives no quarter in being their equal in one of the most important scenes of the movie.

In the particular scene I am referring to William Shakespeare (Branagh), his wife Anne (Dench) and one their daughters Judith (Wilder) are exposing family truths as the screenwriter Ben Elton imagines they would speak yet bringing it in to today's world. When I had time to think about it later I could just imagine a theatre audience seeing it on stage in a play written today and stunning them.

The other scene, between Shakespeare and Henry Wriothesley, the Earl of Southampton, (McKellen) looks into the supposedly love affair between them when both were young men and Shakespeare wrote his sonnets. At one point, without changing a thing, Shakespeare starts talking by reciting one of his sonnets and the Earl recites it back to him. It is as if the two men, not acting, are having a conversation expressing their feelings. Neither sex nor nudity is involved yet you believe you are seeing and hearing both!

While very little is known of Shakespeare's home life, such as the death of his son, Elton presents a plausible story of what may have taken place for the 3 years that Shakespeare returned home to family life after spending most of his life alone in  London at the Globe Theatre which had burned down in 1613.

The only fault, which made it slow moving for only a 100 minute film, is the director's holding on to many unnecessary and lingering nature scenes with the director being Kenneth Branagh.

""All Is True"" might not all be true but it is certainly worth seeing for the acting alone, which shouldn't be but will probably be forgotten at award time."

237,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/judy-punch/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Bertaut1,"Jun 24, 2020",7,"A fascinating socio-political study of proto-feminism mixed with dark comedy

The debut feature from actress turned writer/director Mirrah Foulkes, Judy & Punch is a darkly comic study in proto-feminism, a strange mixture of Monty Python-esque slapstick and serious social critique, wrapping it all up in an anachronistic and pseudo-magical realist aesthetic. It's a mix that shouldn't work, and, for many, it won't - some will find the tonal balance too skewered towards socio-political protest to work as comedy, others will argue the comic elements undermine the socio-political agenda. For me, I thought Foulkes just about got away with it, helped immeasurably by strong performances and a stunning visual design.

In the English countryside town of Seaside (nowhere near the sea), Judy (Mia Wasikowska) and Punch (Damon Herriman) are a young couple with an infant child. The creators of the Punch & Judy puppet show, Judy is by far the more talented puppeteer, but Punch is a natural showman and a master of self-promotion. Although his inability to control his drinking has led to the show's reputation waning, when he hears that a talent-scout is in the area, he determines to curb his drinking. However, when Punch responds to a horrifying accident by viciously beating Judy, she embarks upon a mission of vengeance.

Judy & Punch is, at least in part, another entry in a subgenre we're seeing more and more of in recent years – gynocentric revenge films directed by women; Coralie Fargeat's Revenge and Jennifer Kent's The Nightingale both spring to mind, but you could also include something like Isabella Eklöf's disturbing Holiday, which is a **** drama without the revenge. Given the title, you know from the get-go that the film isn't going to be thematically subtle. Apart from the town's meek constable Derrick (Benedict Hardie) and Scaramouche (Terry Norris), the senile husband of Maude (Brenda Palmer), Judy and Punch's elderly maid, literally every man in the film is a violent misogynistic thug. I don't bring this up by way of criticism, merely to illustrate that the film wears its themes, very proudly, on its sleeve. The Punch & Judy show itself, which invariably involves Punch beating Judy with a stick (itself not exactly a subtle phallic stand-in), has never been especially coy about its own thematic tropes, so why should a film inverting those tropes be otherwise?

One of Judy & Punch's most obvious strengths is the aesthetic, with its lush and vibrant milieu – a realm that's not quite fantasy, not quite historical reality. The town of Seaside, for all its vivid Renaissance-era squalor, is that of a fairy-tale allegory – the kind you'd expect to see terrorised by a werewolf or a giant. Production designer Josephine Ford's work is especially good, and one half-expects to see a gingerbread house in the background.

Enhancing the surreality is the electronic score by François Tétaz, which has no place in a film of this time-period, but which works wonderfully with the stylistic trappings of Foulkes's weird anachronistic vibe. Equally important here is the dialogue, which is a mixture of period-correct diction and a more modern inflection. Put it this way – at one point, we see a group of characters in Renaissance costumes doing tai chi. If that sounds like something you'd find funny, you'll love this exceptionally-realised world.

The acting is universally terrific. Hardie is terrific as the one good man in a town of troublemakers. But unlike the characters played by Clint Eastwood, Derrick has zero authority and no respect. However, despite his ineffectual nature, Hardie plays him as a completely straight-shooter with real interiority. Wasikowska's Judy isn't just a vehicle for feminist rhetoric, but is a capable and fierce woman in her own right. Herriman initially makes Punch seem contemptible, yet as the film goes on, he makes the character even less likeable.

The film does, however, have some problems. For some, it will be too funny to work as feminist critique, and for others, too serious to work as comedy. Others still might argue it works as neither because it never fully commits to either. The narrative and dialogue are also extraordinarily on the nose on occasion. A few of the themes are also under-explored, including domestic violence, which seems to have been included as a plot point simply because it's an issue in the original show – Foulkes never really takes it anywhere.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed Judy & Punch. A statement on oppression and female (re)assertion, it takes the best-known elements of a world-famous puppet show, and inverts them, turning an inherently misogynistic story into a celebration of early feminism. Allegorical in both visual and narrative design, it may be pantomime-esque, but so too is it compelling enough to turn what could have been dismissed as a nasty fairy-tale into a piece of work which is thematically relevant to the milieu in which we now reside."

Mike Flanagan's adaptation is faithful to a fault to Stephen King's material, while also showing so much reverence for Stanley Kubrick's original film that it's hard for this movie to stand on its own. However, a strong sense of style, solid emotional core, and a wonderfully fun and hammy performance by the very underappreciated Rebecca Ferguson make Doctor Sleep a worthwhile watch for fans of horror, King, and/or Kubrick."

I've heard some say it's a poor vision for a sequel and that it explains things about the first movie that were better left a mystery. In total, it provides poor synergy when paired with The Shining and it suffers as a result. I actually agree with these statements and it is a bit unfortunate this was to be a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's classic. But if we separate Doctor Sleep from its partner and judge it on its own merits, I think we have a pretty good movie. It's a suspenseful film with moments of painful terror, and it has a cast of interesting and diverse characters that make's for great storytelling. In addition to this, it caused my ""sci-fi meter"" to spike as it had some of the best ideas I've seen in a while when it comes to psychics. So if you are one of those who've heard how terrible this movie is as a sequel to The Shining, you've not heard wrong.

This biopic dramatizes her marriage and early career up to the landmark case that solidified her crusade as an equal rights activist. Even though Felicity Jones does a decent job of bringing out the character's strengths and doubts, the whole thing feels a bit like a Lifetime flick. The relationship with her husband (Armie Hammer) is sweetly romantic and the repetitive discrimination borders on message movie. The story plays out interestingly enough, but as the crucial trail gets closer, the movie's momentum bogs down with legal wrangling.

Directed by Mimi Leder with a screenplay written by Justice Ginsburg’s  nephew,

Daniel Stiepelman, the film portrays this dynamic lady as a

Aptly portrayed by Felicity Jones in the leading role, Ms. Jones  is supported by by Armie Hammer, Sam Waterston and Justin Theroux. Having attended the same law school when Justice Ginsburg studied there, I can personally attest to the very few female law students in attendance  and how extraordinary they had to be in order to gain admission to this restricted legal club .Clearly, Justice Ginsburg is the embodiment of the best of the best of all of them.

With fine, underrated performances by Felicity Jones and Kathy Bates, the film capably walks viewers through the complexities of the legal landscape without resorting to excessive legalese while simultaneously putting a human face on the central issues in question, both in the lives of the protagonist and those for whom she served as advocate. To be sure, the pacing sometimes gets bogged down, and the screenplay tends to unfold in a safe, tried-and-true, somewhat predictable manner.

One commits a murder, the other is a witness, and when one of them ends up dead, the family is torn apart with one on the run and the other on his heels. It honestly took me a while to watch this movie, because I was tired of Liam Neeson and his very particular set of skills, but his character wasn't what I expected. While not having the popularity of Taken, Neeson's performance in this film, was better than any performance he's given in an action film to date. Paired with the ultimate crime boss, Ed Harris, and The Killing's Joel Kinnaman, this movie had a cast that couldn't fail. Watching this compelling story, I couldn't help but think that this would have been an amazing ending for the Sopranos. Run All Night was surprising in the way that it was done, because it wasn't your typical mafia movie, but it wasn't an action film either. The writers very cleverly combined elements of both to combine the thrilling action of a Falling Down, with the crime story of a really good Sopranos episode. The film wasn't just about the incident and the chase and that's why it was special. They even managed to get Law & Order's Vincent D'Onofrio to play the lead detective in the case, and we all know the intensity he can bring to a role. It was a slow start and a somewhat predictable ending, but in the middle, Run All Night was so good, that I could have stayed up and kept watching it all night."

Pretty entertaining action flick with a fast paced narration. A typical Liam Neeson's movie. Take a gun and go hunt down the bad guys or protect loved ones from them kind of movie. Under his league, like always he was awesome. This has been a already heard story, like a trivia say. Yes, it was similar to 'Road to Perdition', but happens for a different reason and with the different cast. Still the movie was better that I expected.

I went speechless when I saw Neeson was begging in the opening scene. Because that's not his style, action heroes like him, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis et cetera, they don't fit in those roles. But what came just a few minutes later was like switching to second, third, fourth and fifth gear in a quick session. You know you can't judge a book by its cover, same applies for this as well. The film was good, I mean better than average, better than ratings and reviews across the web.

It was kind of unofficial 'A Man with a Gun' trilogy (I made it up) after 'Unknown' and 'Non-stop'. Because if you check it out all these three film's posters, Neeson will be seen with a gun in the similar fashion. Hope this director and actor comes together to do more movies in the future, since it is a rocking combo. Well, they all might not be the masterpieces, but enjoyable at the time of the watch. Especially it will not disappoint Neeson's fans.

There's a lot going on the plot. Plenty of dialog fleshes out the dark and solemn story, characters, and world. It doesn't skip out on the drama. The movie gives Neeson a chance to flex his acting muscles just as much as his action scene ones.

As far as the action scenes go they are quite tense. Brutal shootouts, a fast car chase, and some hand-to-hand combat all are made to feel fresh thanks to the occasional awesome camera angle. Serra shoots scenes in cool ways here. It helps the action which could have felt overly familiar feel fresh instead.

The entire cast gives fantastic performances. There are quite a few characters here acting from different roles that tie together into one cohesive whole. Usually in Neeson movies it's just him stealing the show. Here though there are other actors to keep your attention. Including particularly cool villains in Ed Harris and rapper ""Common"" (Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr.).

It's a particularly grim action-thriller. Part Taken and part A Walk Among the Tombstones with it's own cool ideas thrown in. The results are one of the more exciting action-thrillers to come out in quite a while. It's a wild ride all the way through that doesn't sacrifice any aspect of it's storytelling. It' a dynamite thriller and one of the best films of 2015.

I give this movie a 9.2/10."

284,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/run-all-night/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MattBrady99,"Apr 30, 2015",7,"Yes I know this review is late but March has been a slow month for me with movies not playing at my location theater, it's a pain in the ass sometimes but hey I finally got a chance to watch it and this is what I have to say about.

The story to Run All Night is about a prolific and aging hitman, Jimmy Conlon, once known as The Gravedigger, has fallen on hard times. With the sins of his past catching up, he finds out his estranged son has been targeted by his former mob boss and must now choose between the crime family he grew up with or the family he left behind.

I think I was like everybody else when I sawed the trailer to Run All Night thinking it was another copy cat of Taken with Liam Neeson playing the same character. With all these movie with Liam Neeson playing pretty much the same character in every movie his in is getting a bit old now and his movies now I would call them The Liam Neeson film with action and bullets flying everywhere. Now I don't hate Liam Neeson I actually freaking love the guy he's awesome and his really funny when his mad.

After the long search for this movie and finally viewing it I was actually surprise that this wasn't another Taken movie and more of a movie that can stand on it's own feet as a revenge thriller with a lot of good things in it.

Liam Nesson in this movie isn't just playing himself this time, he's actually got a character ark in this movie and his character isn't all perfect but more damage and understandable. Liam Nesson did a great performance showing all the pain and sadness from his character and Liam nailed it because well this shows you that Liam **** a great actor. Liam Nesson character is the kind of character that I think we all can relate to when he isn't perfect but he's trying his hardest to make things right but it doesn't quite work out, we had that in are life's and it may not happened to you yet but it will do sooner or late, and as I said before Liam pulled it off excellently.

Ed Harris was also great in this movie as he added a lot to his character just like Nesson. I think Liam Nesson and Ed Harris back and forward with each other and how both of them stare each other down, **** talking to each other and ready to attack and the movie took a whole scene to show that and it was like art house brilliant for two characters who are both damage to bounce off each other with their emotions really made one heck of a show.

The directing of the movie I thought did a great job directing characters and actions scenes. The writing in the movie that can be cliche at times but still has some bad-ass lines that will crack a smile on your face or leave you in silence.

The title of the movie doesn't lie at all, the movie is literally set on one night and everyone is always moving around and nobody get's a break everything's always moving. This is what action movie plot should be like and Run All Night gives you that plot that isn't stupid but more creative for what they had.

Now for problems I do have some like: There are so many things going on in this movie with the cops, mob bosses, drug dealers, Ed Harris, Liam Nesson mid life crisis and may god these so many things happening and it feels a bit crushed together at time for how many things they wanted to show.

But overall I had a good time watching Run All Night and I was surprise how it didn't turn into the cliche Liam Nesson action movie that's trying way to hard to be Taken. The movie actually had character ark, a good story to it and a solid cast and actors that pulled **** performance in this surprisingly good movie."

In fact, BJB felt very relevant and up-to-date both in 2016 and in todays world. The story may seem a little unrealistic - two potential fathers who both fight to stay in Bridget and baby’s life - but this does provide the heart of the film and it is a storyline which is 100% worthy for a Bridget Jones movie. 
The script, much like the first film, is witty, engaging and so, so funny. BJB leaves you feeling warm inside while also laughing so hard you may feel something warm running down your leg (🫣). Much different than the first two films, this rom-com revolves around a trio of middle-aged actors and it is all the better for it! Not only does it give a sense of nostalgia, but it gave the franchise a great boost having an instalment set in the 2010’s. I, for one, was able to catch my first Bridget film in the cinema which was a truly special moment for me. I’m sure this was the same for others. 
Emma Thompson is a welcome, and very comical, addition to the ever-growing supporting cast. She stole the show in every single scene she had. I loved her character! As always, Renée Zellweger is outstanding, I literally have no notes because she is perfect as Bridget. The only thing I will note is that, obviously, Hugh Grant did not return for this film and his departure is felt! Bridget with Mark vs Bridget with Daniel worked so well because there was evident chemistry between both pairs. Newcomer Patrick Dempsey did struggle in this area. Thier chemistry was nowhere near the level shared between Zellweger and Colin Firth."

Unlike the first two films, this was not based on the book. Instead, it is an original screenplay that fills the gap between the second and the third book. So reading the third book before watching this film is a spoiler. Most importantly the fourth film is on, only officially have to be announced.

The original director returned to this, but I appreciate the story and the screenplay and people behind it. I did not think this sequel would work, but it exceeded my expectation. A simple story and very familiar settings, but developed so well. There's no Bridget's diary in this, instead an iPad.

Renee Zellweger was totally unrecognisable. Actually, I said that in my 'The Whole Truth' review. But she was good to return as Bridget. Colin Firth looks too older than his actual age, but was great in his part. No Hugh Grant, but a new competitor was introduced which is none other than Patrick Dempsey.

This is not the same kind of narration that we saw a decade ago. Because all the characters are aged, so according to the situation this story takes place. It's a two hour long film, but it had some good jokes. Those who enjoyed the first two would surely enjoy it as well. So choosing it to watch is not a bad idea.

291,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/bridget-joness-baby/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,madmovieman,"Nov 29, 2016",7,"There are few films that irritate me more than the original Bridget Jones’ Diary, and its sequel. Annoying, cheesy and dumb, I never found much enjoyment in them at all, which is the main reason why I was so surprised to like Bridget Jones’ Baby so much. Finally giving the character a likable and interesting persona, whilst also delivering comedy and romance in a confident and fresh way, fortunately moving away from the repetitive first two films, this is by far the best film of the whole series.

To start off, I think the most important reason this film is so enjoyable is because it’s totally different to the first two films. As much as I didn’t like them, I recognise a large audience did. However, 13 years later, it would have been insane to churn out the same formula once again, but I was delighted to see that director Sharon Maguire and writer Helen Fielding managed to provide a different experience.

With Bridget’s now more ‘mature’ and confident persona, this film doesn’t try to be another Pride And Prejudice parody full of awkward slips and mishaps. Yes, there are still a good few clumsy moments, but that’s a part of Bridget’s nature that even I wouldn’t want to see disappear completely, but what this film does so well is manage the balance between idiotic comedy and a genuinely engaging story, making for a far more entertaining watch that allows you to both laugh and get engrossed in Bridget’s various adventures.

One more positive that comes from the story here is that it’s not as insanely focused on Bridget Jones alone. Whilst she’s of course still the main character, a lot of this film is actually dedicated to the characters played by Patrick Dempsey and Colin Firth, both of whom provide excellent comic relief, a different dynamic to Hugh Grant’s bad-boy vibe from the first two films, and an occasional welcome break from Bridget’s inner monologue, which is yet another point that makes this film not only more bearable than the first two, but far more well-rounded and genuinely interesting.

Finally, we can’t ignore Renée Zellweger’s performance here. Along with her character’s maturing, Zellweger gives a far more likable and reasonable performance, making Bridget so much more tolerable than before. Although she was never a huge issue in the first two films, seeing Bridget actually act like an adult throughout, rather than a third edition **** 12 year old girl, was very refreshing, and definitely made her character a lot more accessible and interesting for me.

Overall, I was really surprised by Bridget Jones’ Baby. It’s not only a funnier and more enjoyable watch than its two predecessors, but a welcome evolution for the series, taking Bridget’s ridiculous mishaps down a notch by providing more interesting storytelling, characters and romance, whilst also featuring some of the best acting and directing of the trilogy."

The strong point of the film is the simple fact that it is based, obviously in a very distorted way, on a meeting that really took place between Elvis Presley, one of the most notable music artists ever, and the American President Richard Nixon, remembered by American history for the worst reasons, usually, given that he was one of the few presidents to step down to avoid being forced out from office.

The script is good, and adapts perfectly to a short film like this. In fact, almost everything happens only during one day of the singer's life, who, distressed by drug abuse by young people, decides to collaborate with the authorities as a plain clothed federal agent, secretly, in order to combat the abuses of youth who, for him, corrupted America. Nixon is not a kind of man who adheres to fashions or wants to be with singers, and will naturally pose several objections to the meeting, but he will be overcome by his daughter, who is an Elvis fan.

The cast is as small as the film, but it has a great performance by Kevin Spacey, an actor that I usually don't usually appreciate very much but who did an excellent job as the president. Michael Shannon is an actor I didn't know, I don't remember any of his films, but I think he did an interesting job in the role of Elvis, although I have my doubts about how strict he was in the way he portrayed the King. Obviously, the scenes with the White House advisers stank of comic satire and I don't believe they happened that way. Alex Pettyfer, Colin Hanks and Evan Peters play the secondary roles with dignity and commitment, the latter two with a strong comic streak.

Technically, it is a pleasant film, which entertains and flows smoothly until the end, with good doses of humor and very inspired and colorful dialogues. It has a pleasant cinematography and the costumes make good use of the clothes and fashion of that time. The sets, in turn, are not so visibly dated, but they fit perfectly. The soundtrack is very good and uses iconic songs like ""Hold On, I'm Comming"" by Sam and Dave, or ""Suzy Q"", by Creedence Clearwater Revival, functioning as a true potpourri of the best music of the early Seventies."

Ein Treffen findet tatsächlich statt, das daraus resultierende Foto geht in die Geschichte ein.

In doing so, the film manages to delve into both Elvis and Nixon as people, serving as an interesting look at both of them, even if the story itself is not really true. However, what it lacks in truth, it makes up for with comedy. A smart and witty film, Elvis & Nixon is incredibly well-written as a comedy with lots of little references to real events and outright jokes. The end result of all of this is truly enjoyable hour and a half.

As Elvis, Michael Shannon is loud, boisterous, and magnanimous. However, he does not shy away from the internal struggles facing Elvis and the status of being a celebrity. Though far from unique in this, the film does a good job to evoke feelings of sympathy for ""The King"". Remaining deified to this very day, he is rarely looked at as a person and the film does a good job to make us feel for him on a personal level. He is not just some kooky rock star who wants to be a federal agent, he is a real person and nobody ever gives him that time of day. Shannon's performance is truly magnetic and really carries the film on his shoulders.

As Nixon, Kevin Spacey is equally terrific. Though a lot of it is reminiscent of Frank Underwood in House of Cards, his Nixon feels quite accurate and stoic. Watching his transformation from when he is first told about Elvis wanting to meet him to when he actually meets him is quite comical. Yet, Spacey makes it feel authentic and really captures that ""not cool but want to be cool"" essence that many people have, especially when in the presence of somebody cool. Spacey's turn here also provides many laughs, especially at the end when he is twirling the gun. There is a certain simplicity to the style of comedy in the film and Nixon captures most of the best lines in this one, with Spacey making the most of it with good delivery and timing.

However, in saying this, while the film is quite funny and a good look at both of its real life protagonists, Elvis & Nixon is an incredibly slight film. Coming in at just an hour and a half, Elvis & Nixon is largely just focused on this meeting and setting it up, while pretending to develop of a background relationship/issue for Jerry Schilling (Alex Pettyfer), who is an associate and friend of Elvis. It can certainly drag as you just want them to get to the meeting. The romance background, which is barely looked at, is clearly there to just add some further dimension to the film, but even with that here, Elvis & Nixon rarely makes the case for being a feature-length film. While I did really enjoy my time with it, it probably would have been even better as a short film (40-50 minutes in length maybe), allowing it to be more focused on the photograph and meeting, rather than adding fluff to make it longer.

As a whole, Elvis & Nixon is a very funny film that may be a little too long for its story, but thanks to Shannon's Presley and Spacey's Nixon, the film is incredibly easy to watch."

Shannon portrays The King as a sincere, misunderstood and misguided character, while it's Spacey who gets to satirize the President with hilarious results. The run-up to the encounter unfolds effectively, but isn't especially funny. Actually, other than Spacey, there aren't a lot of laffs. It's more about quiet humor than big comedy.

Sex and the City... both shows were excellent on TV.. and both made for good MOVIES.. but it does not hold the same Quirkiness, Quick and or Constant Nonsense of what makes the show a show.. but its so nice to have two full hours with your favorite characters who do it so well.

It is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and the 23rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts, written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Zendaya, Cobie Smulders, Jon Favreau, J. B. Smoove, Jacob Batalon, Martin Starr, Marisa Tomei, and Jake Gyllenhaal. In the film, Parker is recruited by Nick Fury (Jackson) and Mysterio (Gyllenhaal) to face the Elementals while he is on a school trip to Europe.

Discussions for a sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming began by October 2016, and the project was confirmed later that year. Holland, Watts, and the writers were all set to return by the end of 2017. In 2018, Jackson and Gyllenhaal joined the cast as Fury and Mysterio, respectively. Holland revealed the sequel's title ahead of filming, which began that July and took place in England, the Czech Republic, Italy, and the New York metropolitan area. Production wrapped in October 2018. The marketing campaign is one of the most expensive for a film ever and attempted to avoid revealing spoilers for Avengers: Endgame prior to its April 2019 release.

Spider-Man: Far From Home premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre on June 26, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 2, as the last film in Phase Three of the MCU. The film received positive reviews with praise for its humor, action sequences, visuals, and the performances of Holland and Gyllenhaal. It grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the first Spider-Man film to pass the billion-dollar mark, the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2019, and became Sony Pictures' highest-grossing film and the 24th-highest-grossing film of all time. A sequel, Spider-Man: No Way Home, was released in December 2021."

Based on the 2013 reimagining series that ran on Disney XD, ""Max Steel"" is another entry in the ever-growing superhero film market that is currently being dominated by the comic book bigshots Marvel and DC. Max Steel is an admirable attempt at getting another series going, but was ultimately doomed to be DOA due to the fact that it's a more obscure character and clearly just didn't have the flash or history of it's competition. That's not to say it's all bad though. In fact, Max Steel can be quite entertaining. It's just that a reliance on formula holds it back. It's pretty much your standard superhero origin story. You can see bits of Raimi's Spider-Man as Max McGrath plays around with his newly discovered powers, the plot itself is derivative of those two Amazing Spider-Man movies, and the villain feels like he was pulled straight from 2008's Iron Man. It's a hodgepodge of borrowed ideas tied together with the character's own original lore, which I must say is surprisingly well-handled in that you get an answer to all your questions by the end of the film. Further explanation as to the reasoning behind those explanations, like what actually causes Max's weird powers in the first place isn't something the movie gets into. Oh, so he's filled with Tachyon energy. Why? Because aliens? Okay I guess. The writing is just lacking a little something needed to stand up amongst it's very successful peers.

The action scenes in the movie are fine and the characters themselves are pretty likable. Even believable. Particularly Max himself. Ben Winchell does a great job in the lead role. The dialog itself is surprisingly great as well. The interactions between characters feel real right up until some cheesy dialog during the final showdown. It's this kind of stuff that kept me engaged and entertained even though the movie isn't exactly the next great superhero epic. Even Max's personal dramas of loneliness and an absent father are relatable in a way that this year's Power Ranger's movie was. Luckily, this movie is much better in the action department. The humorous dialog from Josh Brener as ""Steel"" is also much appreciated.

Overall, Max Steel isn't as bad as a lot of movie based on toys have been. It by no means soars to new heights, but can at least prove to be a suitable way to pass the time between the next Marvel and DC film if you really find yourself needing your superhero fix. It should come as no surprise though that the real audience for this movie are the kids who enjoyed the Disney XD show. They'll have a blast watching their once animated hero brought to life in live-action form in his own feature film. Parents and older siblings might even find themselves enjoying it too. So long as they go this knowing it isn't a real standout in any way."

Most Meta reviewers are Caucasians that think right off the bat think that the film is racist and full of stereotypes, but have no idea what it was like living in the ghetto or the projects in California. From La to Oakland drugs, money, and violence has plagued the streets, but nothing matches to what the cartel or Mexican, Hispanic, Chicano gangs are capable of and this film shows that true darkside of it all. Images that you only could find on bestgore rides through this movie keeping focused on every character especially Shia LaBeouf's. Kreeper is just a straight up sicario and just by watching his character you can feel the natural psycho extert off Shia and realize why Hollywood won't give him roles anymore and its just because he makes it feel too really. The gruesomeness throughout film just reminds you of what Mexico deals with on the regular and could not imagine this happening today in California since it takes place in the ghettos of LA. But the movie did fall short with feeling rushed kind of loosing character development and moving so quick that it felt like you missed so much from the main characters that weren't kreeper. But the film was overall enjoyable and not the worst thing that has been released this year and can find yourself relating to the film if you grew around the a ghetto area because thats the only way you'd figure out if they just straight stereotyped everyone in the film which they did not because the main characters wife works for a large company and is actually the smart one since she handles the accounts or if thats really how they act at times. The film could have been better, but i was glad to see something realistic instead of a special effects film that makes no sense for once. So all and all I recommend this film much more than anything Netflix is making at the moment."

The film provides a realistic example of how quickly someone of faith can be tested and tried by society. Melissa Joan Hart was perfect for this role! It was a treat to see Pat Boone again on the big screen!"

However, if you are a unbeliever, you will either hate it or become a christian, there is no other way around it. The gospel message inside this very will made and performed flick is so powerful that it is impossible to see it with a impartial mind. If you are born again, you will cry tears of joy multiple times, if you hate God, you´re going to hate everything about this movie. It is a landmark in spiritual cinema and should be watched by everyone that knows the Lord."
356,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/gods-not-dead-2/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,MrGreenTurtle,"Apr 25, 2016",9,"is is an encouraging movie. It expresses the faithfulness of God, and the real hope found in the name of our savior. Atheists may not like it, but this is a very good representation of their aggression and anger towards Christians every day. It even goes as far as to prove the existence of the man named Jesus (whether or not someone is willing to believe that he is the son of God is another story). Yet, their responses to our faith are understandable, being as the existence ****, and the right to believe in one stands in the way of their awful agendas.  

Man loves darkness, and therefore his works are evil. Light and darkness cannot truly coexist (one will always try to snuff out the other) and God's Not Dead 2 portrays this concept perfectly. The world's persecution of Christians is only going to get worse as time presses on, and one day soon we are going to be forced to make a very hard choice, very much like the main character: Grace Wesley. Do we stand with God and lose everything - maybe even our lives, that we may have life more abundantly in heaven, or do we abandon him for the fleeting, disintegrating lusts of the flesh? Do we let fear of man overthrow our hearts, or the unconditional love of God fill us with overflowing peace and rest in the face of darkness?  

This movie will remind us that we can trust God even when life gets dark. We stand together as the children of God, born again through Jesus' ultimate sacrifice for our sins and we are part of his kingdom. But we need to press in to Christ and let him present his goodness to us in all things. Ask and we will be given, knock and the doors will be opened to us. If we hunger and thirst in the spirit, we will be filled with the bread of life and given living water. Everything we will ever need (physically & spiritually) will be found through resting in God's love. We need to keep our focus on Jesus, lest we sink in the midst of a storm - for storms are coming. But God's love for us all is unmeasurable and he will never leave, nor forsake us. He is always there right beside us, and that is what I got from God's Not Dead 2.

Final Thoughts: If you are a born again believer, this movie will lift you up! I always find it amusing that whenever a great christian movie is released to the public, a parade of Atheists attack it with a storm of hateful reviews. As Christians, we don't send a renegade of nasty reviews everytime a hollywood classic comes out, simply because it doesn't agree with our bible or line up with our spiritual beliefs. It doesn't bother us because we're looking to the light-and the light completely over powers the darkness. Yet, to those living in the darkness, a movie like God's Not Dead 2 shines so brightly on them, that all they can do is try and push it back. It really just goes to show how real of an enemy we actually deal with.

Atheists don't realize it, but the devil uses them like pawns in an obvious attempt to steer believers away from receiving the messages of true Christian movies. He knows the power and effect that they could have in our hearts or in our lives. Infact, the nasty reviews I saw attatched to the first God's Not Dead was the very reason I almost never watched it at all. But a friend later recommended it to me and my parents even asked if I wanted to watch it with them, so I obliged. And afterwards I felt encouraged and desiring a deeper relationship with Jesus. It was an excellent Christian movie, and the sequel is a powerful addition.

Pay absolutely no attention to a single atheist opinion of this title. Don't let them steal the healing message that God has for you here. At the same time, if you are a christian just looking to be entertained, you may still miss the true point of God's Not Dead 2. But if you are looking for an honest word from the heart of God then I can promise that you will not find disappointment. God bless!"
357,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/gods-not-dead-2/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,TheQuietGamer,"Apr 8, 2016",7,"The first ""God's Not Dead"" tried to uplift Christians and convict nonbelievers. The latter of which it largely failed to do thanks to it's awkward nature and a rather harsh depiction of the very people it tried to minister to. For the sequel that issue has been avoided. This time around the focus is solely on entertaining a Christian audience while delivering a message to said Christians with little to no preaching at nonbelievers. As a result it's a better film in several ways.

That's not to say all of the issues from the previous movie have been fixed. It still suffers from awkward moments, pacing, and writing early on before the actual case takes place. The side-plots do a better job this time around of connecting back to the main conflict, but still feel underdeveloped.

As for the movie's message it's all about standing strong in your faith. The court room drama aspect of the film is all about showing ways to defend our views. It's strategies are defense, but somehow the message is offense. There's a bit of a clash there as the film keeps saying ""we're at war"" and ""we need to fight back,"" but it's constantly playing defense. It's telling us to get ahead of the game, but is having it's characters sit back and wait the fight to come to them. The film has a conflict with it's conflict.

God's Not Dead 2 manages to avoid some of the shortcoming of it's predecessor, but adopts some of it's own along the way. Overall though I can't help but feel that it's a better movie seeing as how it almost solely focuses on entertaining Christians, the only audience who will appreciate it anyway. There is perhaps some pandering at times, but overall this is a movie that built around pleasing it's expected audience. No more, no less.

As a result if you aren't of the faith then I can't recommend it. Especially if you didn't enjoy the first. It's got it's issues and really only Christians are going to put up with them. As a Christian I can say that I enjoyed the new direction and was completely aware that this was built from the ground up to please me. It didn't always succeed, but I enjoyed the overall movie. So for Christians, yeah go watch it. For nonbelievers, this isn't something you'll enjoy in the slightest. At least not without a sense of curiosity, forgiveness, and an open-mind."

I know making a different genre out of a show whose star has faded may seem like an odd choice, but they did make two successful comedies based on 21 Jump Street. Plus the nice thing about working with a property that the newer generation was never familiar with is that you get leeway with creative changes. (Note to self: work on script for Petticoat Junction political thriller.) I don't think this is perfect, but it is an interesting watch.

This actually honors the feel of the original far more than the commercials made me thought it was going to. A good part of the beginning and middle is looking at the characters' fantasies before anything goes crazy. (This PG-13 film is kind of more a dark fantasy than full horror.) All the characters have their personal conflicts and lessons. Each fantasy is distinct and I found them all rather interesting. There were a lot more twist and turns than I'd anticipated.

Though there was a lot I liked about this, it could've been better. It's one of those cases where the director/writers had good ideas and came from a positive place but couldn't reach their full potential. The dialogue is often basic or just weak. The actors aren't able to do much with it. We're talking about a cast with experience too, not a bunch of newbies. Pretty Little Liars' Lucy Hale particularly fumbles and Michael Pena as Mr. Roarke, the one running the island, is hit-and-miss.

A lot of people are downright hating this movie. I think that's bit much. Personally, I think it'so-so at worst. I think it's worth your risk seeing it at some point. It feels a little different than most films."

It's combination of silly sci-fi elements and political thriller plot is what keeps the movie going when cities aren't being reduced to rubble by monstrous weather anomalies. It's predictable for sure and the destruction itself is brought to life by some visuals that are slightly below par (the lightning is outright laughable). Yet, even with it's dopey plotting there's still some suitable entertainment to be found in a turn your brain off sort of way.

Outside **** plot hole the biggest issue with the story is the amount of clichéd family drama. The characters are of the cookie cutter variety and rather than focusing on the more effective form of emotional manipulation by delivering more moments between the main character and his daughter, Geostorm places it's emphasis on the sibling rivalry side of things. Some that is hindered greatly by Jim Sturgess' absolute twerp of a character. He is the definitive boogerhead little brother, complete with bad haircut. The dialog in this film is humorously bad at times. There are moments so stupid that you can't help but have fun with them. Part space adventure and part nature-fueled destruction fest, Geostorm can provide a good time if you can appreciate some cinema trash. It's a Gerard Butler movie for crying out loud. If you were expecting anything more than a dumb popcorn flick then you're an idiot. Only not the kind that will be able to appreciate Geostorm's surprisingly fun combination of the familiar and the ridiculous with a dash of good intentions that's all delivered with a straight face when it needs to be, but has no problem showing off it's silly side (like it had a choice)."

The president of the USA, far-reaching conspiracy, the world in danger, a few good (wo)men doing what is right, impending big disaster – if these keywords fit your cup of B, then „Geostorm“ may have what it takes to entertain you for 109 minutes and leave a good aftertaste.

When the network of satellites designed to control the global climate starts to attack the planet instead, it's a race against the clock to uncover the real threat before a worldwide geostorm wipes out everything and everyone.

Most of the story actually takes place in space, so considerable part of the visual effects budget has been spent to show us the International Space Station, satellites and the big cold void that we like to call the universe. And after having your fill of „cosmos porn“, there are big natural disaster scenes to fall back on.

The disasters dominate the promoting materials but are actually in minority, and mostly mercifully short. They look awesome but are not essential to the story and thus tend to even somewhat disrupt the general atmosphere and flow. Especially near finale, which is mercifully short too. Because good entertainment should always know when to end and not stretch over two hours or something.

Starring Gerard Butler – the unsung hero and go-to guy to any self-respecting B- or generic movie – who is joined by a surprisingly large and impressive cast including Jim Sturgess, Abbie Cornish, Talitha Eliana Bateman, Adepero Oduye, Ed Harris, Andy Garcia, Alexandra Maria Lara, Daniel Wu, Eugenio Derbez, and Amr Waked.

It’s also worth noting that almost all major female characters are written as strong individuals and don’t rely on their looks (although they do look good of course).

This approach is something that freshens and updates the general vibe reminiscent of the big dumb 1990’s movie that the director and co-writer Dean Devlin became really famous for originally, meaning „Independence Day“. Back then, of course, he was just a writer and co-creator with Roland Emmerich, here he debuts as director too.

But cool actors, strong female characters and even big-budget special effects will only get you so far, when the movie is lacking the most essential of elements: heart.

And „Geostorm“ has a lot of heart, which is the main reason I liked and enjoyed it so much – in spite of its weak storytelling where things mainly happen because they are ought to, not develop naturally.

It’s a minor miracle that despite all the unrealistic-ness and cheesiness of the story – it's a B-movie, after all – the actors are so spot on, full of heart and conviction that you just have to buy all this what’s happening on screen.

This is probably thanks to Devlin’s brilliance at putting together this kind of big cheesy thing. It was about time he started directing too!

Leading star Gerard Butler, in some movies just a poor man’s Aaron Eckhart, is in especially good form, a shining example of how to breathe life into otherwise generic material, and grab us along with the ride.

If you think that spouting all these silly lines and making it feel believable must be easy, as it seems for him, then you should try acting for youself.

In a way, his charismatic work here feels as much an achievement as Matthew McConaughey’s in „Interstellar“ which is actually not the weirdest association if one was to compare the central themes of the two movies. But if this comparision seems too out-there, there are also parallels with many apocalyptic blockbusters from „Armageddon“ to „The Day After Tomorrow“.

So… I liked it. „Geostorm“ is certainly cheesy, but it does what it does really well. Go catch this!"

Zac Efron is really funny, he has shown that he's got comedic guts over and over again. I am becoming a fan of as I keep on seeing him in these kind of movies .
Robert De Niro is also awesome on the role all throughout. I also really liked the supporting characters, especially Jason Mantzoukas as a drug dealer who had me laughing every time he was on screen.
Sure this movie isn't nowhere near a comedic masterpiece and nor is it trying to be. It is a fun ride from beginning to end, and despite all the cliches, the jokes are what make this ride worth it."

It is for this reason, that people are staying away from this film, and they are making a big mistake, here's why. At 73, with over one hundred films under his belt, is it really that surprising that Robert De Niro is bored and looking to try something new? In reviewing his credits, he's never been in what one would call a raunchy comedy, and for it what it's worth, he was outstanding. De Niro plays a man who has just lost his wife of fifty year, and is looking to reconnect with his Grandson, and of course get laid. After tricking his Grandson into taking him to Florida, the two wind up at Spring Break in South Beach, where the hilarity begins. De Niro's grandson is played by Zac Efron, who took a while to lose the teen idol label and find his niche as the awkward, but lovable guy in these extreme comedies. Their two characters are so different, that just bringing the personalities together is enough to make things funny, but when you throw them into ridiculous situations together the laughter is off the charts. Personally, I am someone who has found some of the most classic comedies of all time to be a waste of time. Humor is something I enjoy, but not something that I understand easily, and I found Dirty Grandpa to be one of the funniest films, I've ever seen. You will not believe just how raunchy it gets or the lengths De Niro is prepared to go to in order to get some good laughs at his age. I too was thinking this film would be ""okay"" at best, but I was wrong, and so are my fellow critics. Dirty Grandpa is hysterical and those who are avoiding it due to bad reviews and similarities to other films, are really missing out."

I have NO IDEA how someone can give this movie a poor score. Carrying that same amazing, haunting, beautiful, touching, moving DNA from 'This is Us', 'Life Itself' is a story that should not be missed.

This movie is beautifully woven, bringing together different stories that, together, tell a tale that is bigger than all its individual parts. Life as the ultimate narrator and all of us as parts of an amazing story that is told through years, generations, through pain and love. First thing I did when I left the theater was to call my mom and tell her how much I love her and how much I appreciate the fact that I have her in my life. This movie has spoken to me and touched me, leaving me in a sore, yet peaceful catharsis.

DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS. Go watch this movie! It will destroy your heart, but I will be worth it in the end, I promise."
413,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/life-itself-2018/user-reviews/?filter=Positive%20Reviews,Trineo99,"Nov 9, 2018",7,"Now the acting in this film was marvelous. Oscar Isaac was the main stand out to me. He could easily switch from a romantic scene to a comedic scene to  finally a depressing scene so well and you really feel for his character. And despite Antonio Banderas’ old age, no offense,  he also did a stellar performance. When I first found out that he was going to be in this film I thought, ‘Oh god no,’ but after  seeing him in the film I now take that back. His character was one that I would love to have as a parent. The final person that I want to give a  shout out to is Olivia Cooke. Her character was one that a lot of teenagers can probably relate to, or at least the ones who  went through  similar/the same experiences/situations like what she did. The humour in this film was definitely directed at  younger people because my friend and I  were laughing a lot when nobody else was, which  can be both a good thing and a bad thing. In addition,  the cinematography was stunning in this film, and each shot had great lighting . The final good thing I want to mention is how well the serious scenes were taken. Some films can’t do serious scenes without making a joke out of it or it being out of place but this film did them so well. This might have come from how the director and writer, Dan Fogelman, also created “This is Us,” so he knows how to do drama. Now for some of the bad things. The pacing in this seemed off, just by a bit. It felt like they would drag on too much of one person's story and then cut it short at some of the others. Now I understand that they probably wanted to keep it short, but maybe a longer movie would have helped it out a bit more. The movie was predictable as well. Sometimes, being predictable is fine but not when you’re trying to make your audience cry. In the end, “Life Itself” really depends on what you look for in a movie. If you like romcoms  then you’ll like this movie, but if you don’t, you’ll probably won’t ."

This story would have been better served by spanning it over several seasons of episodes; there is way way way too much going on.  I'm a staunch sci-fi fan, yet ALL the scifi things just happened/progressed/clicked so quickly; the brilliance of scifi is how people respond and cope and grow (or not) in the face of crisis and change and opportunity and realization.  Because so much was happening and the transitions so blisteringly fast, the human component was likewise skimmed.  I'd watch the same type of film again, though couldn't commend it, and will remain sad that better justice wasn't done to the story, actors, and concepts by giving them a proper format rather than an ultra-abridged movie version."

I know some people seem to dislike the amount of blood and sex but hey, I think they’re just wimps. The sex? Couldn’t care less for BUT at least it was Mads and seemed to serve the greater purpose of murder! I mean sure Duncan survives way more than he should but so what, it’s an action flick who cares.

I feel the reviewers to the left have never experienced a campy shindig before. Polar follows a style of being campy and fun, for the sake of being campy and fun. This even is used to make a couple of hard-hitting emotional moments in the latter half more impactful. It's fun to watch, even if you have a want for deep themes and artsy moments. It feels semi Noir as we follow Mads Mikkelsen in his quest to try and enjoy retirement but there are people who don't want him to. The sexual scenes really shouldn't put you off unless you're over the age of 60, granted I do agree they were probably didn't need to be there, especially the third one. It makes sense but isnt needed.

But the movie is just fun to watch, it's presented in a very self-aware style, it acknowledges the craziness of its characters and doesn't even try to justify that, it just goes with it. As the film lets you have fun with over the top action sequences, fun and relatable personalities. Great locations and set pieces, great visual effects and editing. The film is bloody and it isn't shy about showing that. Our hero Duncan is a 50-year old hitman, the best of the best and to prove that he has to kill a lot of people but it stays fresh with those fun action sequences. With those comedic moments, with that fun style of writing, not deep edgy lines about how hurt and tragic Duncan is, but rather having Duncan being an unwilling badass for the first part of the movie, but then he's forced to defend his life and the life of others and that's when you really start to connect with Duncan, he was cool and fun to watch at first then he became badass, emotional and relatable. It takes the Logan route (Great Film btw) **** old veteran trying to escape his old life but Polar is fun, exciting and hard-hitting towards the end while Logan is heartwrenching and an amazing story to watch.

Polar won't win awards for it's deep themes or characters with tons of depth, but if you're looking for a fun action film? A film that can laugh with you. A film that will impress you in every way possible? Polar is a great choice, it's nothing to rave over, no reason to rave down to the film store and spend 10$ on but if you're on Netflix definitely atleast try this film. It's 20x better than what it seems, it isn't the pure edgy thriller that it seems. It's fun and makes you emotional towards the end. Even if it's held back slightly by a predictable plot and character moments, it's mindless fun and is at least worth a glance"

I watched a lot of movies in my life but I never watched one as great as this one and it makes me so sad that the critics did not get it, because it is truly well made. The world needs to see this and the movie needs to reach a much greater audience. I just happened to see the trailer on Youtube and I am so glad that I did.

Sandler bent over backward to create this rather off-the-wall comedy piece, he knew would probably receive slapback. Obviously many critic haters forgot how to laugh. This movie is hysterical, particularly because Sandler cast the right actors in the right roles again, and the script was great. The man still has it, at his age, and he delivered. And I was never much a fan of David Spade, Rob Schneider, or Steve Zahn, but they are awesome players here. As for the ""stereotyping"", are people truly kidding? Look at all the classic Eastwood westerns and some of the Mel Brooks classics like Blazing Saddles, that rocked box offices in the day. Some of them were considered somewhat racial, ethic, or gender stereotype controversial, in spite being popular films. Particularly Brooks with Blazing Saddles, though the movie was a comedy, but quite hilarious. Sandler is Jewish but knows how to laugh, and at himself and his religion, the same as Brooks, who poked fun at religion in History of the World, etc."

I laughed on more than a few occasions (the baseball scene and the bank-robbing montage in particular) and I really don't see why everybody thinks it's so racist. Sure, there were a few scenes that might seem kind of offensive, but overall, there wasn't anything as racist as Rob Schneider pretending to be a Native American in ""Bedtime Stories"". Some of the jokes were a bit gross, but there were still more laughs than the average Sandler flick.

Las actuaciones no se me hacen la gran cosa, la historia se me hace como un capitulo alargado de la rosa de Guadalupe pero de mayor presupuesto, tiene escenas incomodas e innecesariamente estupidas como en la cual la pareja sexual de la protagonista empieza a hacer una especie de arte marcial completamente desnudo y otra donde detienen un incendio. Ademas de que se siente demasiado lenta y con muchas escenas sin chiste.
Ha sido una de las pocas peliculas que estuve de punto de dejar de ver de lo mala que se me hizo, ademas pienso que la calificacion de la critica esta realmente inflada y solo apoyada porque el director es de renombre, al igual la nota de los usuarios se me hace muy alta.
Sin duda esta fue la pelicula mas sobrevalorada de su respectivo año de estreno.

Could she love that young man? Is she aware that women like her are second class citizens, a fact we in the audience are constantly reminded of.

Critics love it because it doesn’t go for the happy ending.  Casey Affleck will likely win an Oscar for Best Actor.   Affleck plays an average lower-middle working-class guy living in a small coastal fishing town.  Michelle Williams (who is probably too pretty to be believable for the part) plays his wife, and they have three young kids.  Affleck is a happy guy with zero aspirations in life and spends his free time boating, drinking with his buddies and dabbling in recreational drugs.  The movie would have you believe that many people live this kind of life, and that most can get away with living a sloppy and ambitionless life without consequences but, in the dice game of life, Affleck takes a stupid gamble and rolls snake eyes.  He becomes a haunted and angry individual who moves to Boston and ekes out a living as a janitor.  Several years later, his older brother dies and names Affleck the guardian of his high-school age son.  This could have been a movie about redemption.  (It’s the obvious ending choice, and you will find yourself hoping for it, rooting for it.)  Instead, you get a cautionary tale about broken people. Those who like this movie use a lot of adjectives to describe it like: ""heartbreaking, genuine and powerful.""  It is all those things but, it’s also a movie without hope. The ending is sudden and abrupt like a cold slap in the face, a lump of coal in your Christmas stocking, or discovering the Grinch in your living room instead of Santa Claus.

Some very beautiful shots & imagery in this movie. I loved the opening on the boat, gave a sense of raw realism. There were some moments I enjoyed for sure... but they were too far and few between.

Hearing the audience giggle at certain points showed the company I was in.

This revelation, which was brought to light by a team of reporters from a daily sports journal of all things, led to the dissolution of the government and a probing look into the nation's hospital network, exposing system-wide corruption that had been in place long before the catalytic event that spurred this inquiry. ""Collective"" relates the unfolding of these events through unprecedented access to the journalists and reformers who sought to expose a system where patient care was secondary to the self-serving interests of politically connected administrators and their crooked affiliates. However, while director Alexander Nanau's impressive and authentic documentary is indeed a remarkable piece of investigative journalism, its raw footage approach to the presentation of its material is often dry and talky, failing to stoke the kind of outraged emotional response that a work like this should handily accomplish. It thus plays more like a radio report on film than an engaging cinematic presentation, diluting much of the impact that its findings should generate. Sadly, the victims of this tragedy truly deserve more, not only from the government that let them down, but also from the vehicle through which their story was told."

Her ability to make a low-key character as credible as a high-energy character. Or to make a working class woman as believable as a wealthy and powerful women. She's great in pretty much anything, and I've bought movies knowing nothing about them except that they starred Cate Blanchett.

I don't care for her too much in CAROL, and in fact, I don't care much for the film. I can accept a film that is quiet, where passions are banked and never allowed to burst into full flame (or at least, not often). But I don't actually want to be lulled to sleep by the film. But there are long stretches that are infuriating because they are a) slow paced & b) there doesn't really seem to be anything happening in the inner-lives of the characters either. CAROL takes the concept of meaningful glances or the exchange of smoldering looks to a degree where sometimes it feels that this is all the film is really about.

Blanchett plays a bored wife (Carol) of a well-to-do man (Kyle Chandler) who is under something resembling occasional house-arrest for a ""romance"" she had with an old female friend (Sarah Paulsen). Essentially, she had an affair, one exacerbated by the fact that it took place with a woman (oh, did I mention, this is the early '50s). On one of her rare trips ""into the city"", Carol shops in the toy department of a big department store, and exchanges glances with the shopgirl (Rooney Mara) who helps her decide on a gift for her daughter. The scene clearly must mean something, because it goes on for a long time. Yet I never felt any passion stirring or smoldering or any HEAT. But Mara is clearly stricken by Blanchett, and when she realizes the lady has left a personal item behind on accident, she sends it back to Carol, and this small kindness leads to Mara spending more and more time with Carol. Apparently, they have the hots for each other, but we sure don't see it for the LOOONGEST time!

I get **** the '50s, feelings of desire for the same-sex were, shall we say, frowned upon and needed to be kept carefully hidden. But CAROL fumbles because it takes so much time avoiding anything coming to the surface even when the two women are alone together. Mara's character is conceived as a bit of a simpleton (in my mind). I suppose she's supposed to be naive and that these feelings are new to her (except they aren't, as we find out in scenes with her friendly but oblivious boyfriend). She seems somewhat out of touch with her own feelings. And occasionally she sounds like she's **** speech slurs and her articulated thoughts meander.

But Blanchett is the biggest miss here. I would have expected those relentlessly silent scenes, or the ones where characters talk about one thing when clearly they're thinking of something else, to have had more impact thanks to her ability to convey her inner life so well. She's done it before (NOTES ON A SCANDAL jumps to mind). But here she seems nearly vacuous. She seems to be striving towards a sensuousness that she's having to keep **** she certainly keeps it hidden (I feel bad bashing her so much, but in my opinion, she is just simply not that good here.)

The movie essentially follows the development of their relationship and also shows its impact on the lives of the men who love them. The ending is actually interesting and in some ways a bit surprising and unexpected. It might even have been stirring if only we cared one bit about these two characters.

So why do I even give the film as many as 3 stars. Well, first of all, the production & costume design is impeccable. The toy department in which Mara works is a nostalgic delight (I wasn't alive then, but it just felt so completely RIGHT). Mara, despite my overall dislike of her character, has moments that are quite nice. The final 20 minutes or so of the film finally kick into a bit of a higher gear (thank goodness) and rescue it from complete forgetability.

I know that this film just racked up some Oscar nominations, including for Blanchett. So clearly I am not in the majority regarding this film. But when a film is about PASSION, whether on open display or carefully hidden, I still need to feel that passion, either because it's openly represented, or clearly building beneath the surface. Instead, I'm left to infer what these characters are feeling, and if I don't care about them much, I'm not willing to make that kind of effort or investment. When the film was over, my wife and I discussed the film for **** were both in agreement that it was not great, and so our discussion was about why the film was held in such high acclaim. We never settled on a definitive answer, because this is so subjective to start with. But in the end, I have to stick with my gut feelings...CAROL just doesn't work."
505,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/carol/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,kino_avantgarde,"Dec 8, 2022",5,"It is a film that is neither deep enough to be praised nor shallow enough to deserve unfair knocking. While the presence of Cate Blanchett adds value to the film, she shows a bit too much in the foreground, which reduces the depth I believe.

It has been stated that smoking is used as an element of nonverbal communication rather than a masculine symbol. Carol smokes when she is self-confident or she wants to impress someone else. Likewise when she is very tense and distressed. Yet not when she is very happy, calm and content; eg in the car, restaurant, motel / hotel. It is observed that she did not smokes for a long time until she had to return home.

Maybe the book is more impressive, so the movie may have fallen short of expectations. However, for a movie that made such a big impact (77 wins & 255 nomination), it could have been so much better in my opinion."

I wish Anthony Minghella or Sydney Pollack were alive to direct this. The movie had very good art direction and little else going for it. There was little to no chemistry between leads. Sarah Paulson and Ellen Page should've been in the leads as they really are lesbian. And like others have said, there was little to know about Rooney's character so how would Carol even love her so immediately, let alone love her over Paulson's more interesting character? The movie was TOO slow. The music was a little too intrusive at times, though mostly beautiful. And the script needed a lot more subtext; especially for that era. I'm going to have to watch The Talented Mr. Ripley again just to wash the mediocre taste out of my mouth from this. Matt's a lot more convincing as gay than Rooney was in Carol."

""Carol"" was a disappointment and not a movie I would recommend.  The book was far more believable."

510,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/carol/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Jan 9, 2016",5,"""""Carol"" is an excellent movie with one major negative aspect and two minor quibbles but more about those later. There is no finding fault with the cast as Cate Blanchett a wealthy married woman seeking a divorce from her husband Kyle Chandler. Blanchett  has previously had an affair with Sarah Paulson, a school friend, and is now embarking on an affair with young, not rich, department store clerk, Rooney Mara. The latter is going with a dapper, rich, sort of snobbish boy played by Jake Lacey, though it is Blanchette who buys her the expensive camera she needs to further her pursuit of a career as a photographer. There is also John Magaro a poor, nice guy who works at the New York Times who might be able to help Mara get a job there but he also has feelings for her. Along with the minor figures in ""Carol"" each and every performer gives their best and in the case of Blanchett, Mara and Chandler that is high praise indeed.

The director Todd Haynes, the screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, the perfect production design by Judy Becker, the camera work by Ed Lachman along with the costumes by Sandy Powell and the period music by Carter Burwell bring us a perfect picture of the early 1950s. Not only do we see the right cars like Blanchette's Packard and her full length creamy mink coat but the streets of New York, the Oak Room of the Plaza hotel but even more important the morality of that time regarding homosexuality and the blackmail that can ensue even from people who love you. Though wealth and class levels are brought forward they are done in subtle ways still getting the message across.

There is nothing salacious or predatory about the older woman/younger woman really drifting into an affair with the older woman being who she is and the younger woman finding out who she is. Blanchett and Mara are completely believable in this journey they are taking together.

Now we come to the negative aspect and the quibbles mentioning the latter first. It is very perplexing considering her love for her child that Blanchett would allow her child to be driven by Chandler who is drunk. Another 'driving' incident is that though we know they are wealth there is never any hint, suggestion, showing that they have a chauffeur though we do see the other household staff and yet in another scene we see Chandler stepping into the rear of a car and being driven away. Petty? Quibbling? Possibly but this is part of the negative aspect that found my very disappointing in ""Carol"". I am a **** for a love story, whether it be between opposite or same sex couples, and yet, in spite of their top rate performances, and even their non-threatening sex scene, I felt nothing for this couple. I didn't, couldn't, find myself rooting for them.

It is because of this feeling, this lack of being emotionally involved with what was going on in the film I find myself in a very small minority and would only recommend ""Carol"" if you have a 'thing' for the early 1950s!"

Dunkirk ""fixes"" this problem by almost completely eliminating the concept of characters, but it does come with big downsides.

On the one hand, it lets Nolan focus on what he's best at: the technicals.

The cinematography is stunning, the editing and direction are pretty good (althought the constantly changing aspect ratio is very distracting).
And the music is, once again, Hans Zimmer pressing his whole arm on the keyboard.

On the other hand, not having any real character makes many scenes feel like they drag for way too long and makes for a very dull experience.

If we knew something about any of these people maybe it would have been different.

Overall, it's not a terrible movie, but a very unmemorable one.
Like most Nolan movies, it's technically impressive.

The lack of characterization makes it more bearable for me than something like Interstellar,
but it does negatively impact what could have been a very compelling drama, instead of just a series of well shot battle sequences."
523,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dunkirk/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,zNeverSleeping,"Sep 17, 2020",6,"Tecnicamente impecável, mas o que é além disso?

Essa obra me causou uma pequena confusão mental. Por um lado, eu estava impressionado. A fotografia do filme é um tão impactante quanto um diamante refletido. A técnica de alternar as proporções funciona muito bem aqui, mesmo que seja mais aparente na Smart TV. A trilha sonora se encontra muito presente, o que pra mim é um ponto positivo. O cenário é absolutamente lindo, seja em alto mar, na terra ou no ar. O elenco tá bem definido, mesmo que o mesmo não tenha um peso muito grande aqui. Enfim, assistir essa obra em 4k HDR é uma experiencia unica.

O roteiro do filme está em outro nível. A compreensão de Nolan quanto a técnica narrativa vai além do esperado, e aqui, mais uma vez, ele prova isso e brinca com a linha do tempo para nos entregar uma experiencia mais impactante. O clímax, onde as três storylines se encontram é muito bem feita e conduzida. Porém, nem tudo são flores.

Apesar da minha agradável concepção aos aspectos técnicos, o filme não parece ter uma alma. Meu envolvimento emocional foi zero. O desenvolvimento dos personagens acontece, mas simplesmente não é o suficiente para criar uma ligação entre os mesmos e o publico. A trilha sonora passa a sensação de que mil e uma coisas estão acontecendo, ou que há algo grandioso para acontecer,  o problema é que essa tensão soa forçada, pois nada a altura da OST acontece, e você fica se perguntando ""porque???""

O cenário, apesar de lindo, não aparenta ser de um filme de guerra. Os soldados não parecem cansados, e toda aquela situação não aprece tão ruim quanto o filme tenta nos enfiar ""goela abaixo"". Para uma total imersão, decidi rever o filme no fone de ouvido, sem legendas e com o áudio original. Porem eu não contava com uma trilha sonora tão alta. Na maioria das vezes, principalmente se tratando de compositores talentosos como Hans Zimmer, isso não me chateia, mas aqui todos os personagens fazem um esforço ENORME pra... sussurrar. Não sou fluente na língua inglesa, porém a dificuldade que tive pra entender as falas foi fora do normal. O filme já conta com poucas linhas de dialogo, e quando há, eu não as entendo.

No final das contas, assisti o filme mais uma vez, priorizando o máximo a imersão e qualidade  do mesmo, mas ainda assim não fui capaz de dizer o que essa historia veio para contar.

Edit: Depois de me esforçar muito, consegui entender o porque muitas pessoas amaram o filme. A atmosfera criada pelo Nolan é, talvez, inovadora. O vazio, a falta proposital de emoção, expressividade ou até personalidade provam o ponto niilista do filme. Eu fiquei um pouco confuso, pois a OST tecla muito no drama, que ao meu ver, não existe sem pre-requisitos. Porém, eu consigo sim compreender o porque esse filme é autentico em alguns aspectos, e isso merece sim seu reconhecimento - mesmo eu não tendo entrado no filme.

Two questions, though: Why couldn't we have some dialogue between Kate and her female friend, re: what she's learned about Geoff's past? It actually felt a bit strange that she didn't bring it up with her, and the missed opportunity seemed like a case of underwriting.

Also, the choice of a song to open & close the film: Who on earth would choose ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" at their wedding, or anniversary celebration? Do you listen to the lyrics? Again, it was implausible and/or lazy, in my opinion: It fits at the end, but come on!"

It's a very well-acted picture, but with the skillful acting in the service of a slim story premised on the idea that a woman (Charlotte Rampling) could be married to a man (Tom Courtney) for 45 years without ever sensing that he had had a previous love. This seems naive. Furthermore, although the embers are obviously dimmed in old age, you don't get the sense that this relationship was ever so romantic that it would have blinded the woman to the husband's secret for very long. Theirs has been a marriage of companionship and mutual comfort, not passion; without passion, there is no plausibility for her failure of perception. It was only when Rampling surreptitiously viewed some decades-old slides of the young woman taken before her tragic death that I personally felt any sense of dramatic involvement with the movie. The earthy, sensual face that stares out at us in those photographs, Rampling's diametrical opposite in every way, was very well-chosen; and in those moments you do get the sense that she would have been a much better match for Courtney…..

This discovery brings memories of twenty-something passion and optimism into a house imbued with sixty-something acceptance, and the resulting trainwreck grows more interesting and affecting the farther it grinds along the rails.  Takes a while to get there, though, or seems to, despite the film’s 95-minute length.  Rampling is outstanding, and nowhere more than in the film’s masterful last scene. P.S.

DeNiro and Pacino are miscast. Frank Sheehan and Jimmy Hoffa were of Irish heritage. The likes of Liam Neeson would have been more appropriate as Sheehan. The middle section is repetitive and concentrating on Hoffa so much throws the movie off balance. Pacino in a bad hairpiece chewing the scenery doesn’t help.

On re-watching, the jeopardy and stakes in the film felt significantly more contrived. The tension and plot twists that initially thoroughly engaged me now seemed forced and predictable. Additionally, the characters, both human and emotional, were much less likeable this time around. Some, like Joy and Sadness, which I once found endearing, came across as annoying.

Beautifully shot, evocative of a lazy, lovestruck summer month in the gorgeous Italian countryside, it's a thoughtful, peaceful slice of bittersweet romance if not a terribly active one.

Strangely edited, we'll cut away in the middle of a conversation but linger for long stretches of scenery and minor character actions. That does effectively convey the boy's listlessness, his adolescent ennui within a magnificent family estate, but it also leads to major pacing problems. Though it runs just over two hours, I caught myself glancing at the clock after one. Our two leads, Elio (the boy) and Oliver (the intern), share the flicker of chemistry, but initially flirt with so much nuance and subtext that I thought I'd missed something when it came time for their inevitable heart-to-heart.

The climax is excellent, with a charged, open-hearted monologue from Elio's father and an unforgettable close-up during the credits, but by that point I was more than ready to check out. Long, tedious, occasionally rewarding and very, very art house."

The fact that it left tears and smiles on the audience's face at the end explains why he is so identified with the audience.

However, if there is one thing to remember, it is the difference between successful and quality film. In addition, success is subjective, quality (technical) objective data; It would be more rational to compare from this point of view.

Whether la la land is a ""dreamland"" as depicted in the movie, or just a fake paradise, the decision is yours. I only respect the ones which touches my brain, not necessarily or only my heart."

580,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/la-la-land/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,ClariseSamuels,"Sep 18, 2018",6,"Film musicals have a long and venerable history in Hollywood, although we see less of them now in this age of skepticism when viewers are slightly less inclined to be seduced by the magic and the illusion of the big screen. Films based on Marvel Comics, which now rule the industry, have succeeded in resurrecting some of that old wizardry that makes the audience forget themselves as they plunge into a make-believe world. Trying to make a magical musical in the twenty-first century that references the classics of the 40’s and 50’s is a risky business, but La-La Land has succeeded in charming its audiences with its song, dance and simple love story of two young people with a dream. Nevertheless, translating what is basically a stagecraft into a musical film is difficult. The forced artificiality of breaking out into song and dance (the phenomenon known as “I feel a song coming on”) is born of the architecture and design of stage and theatre, which is artificial in and of itself. Suspension of disbelief is required for performances limited by the spatial dimensions of the stage, but with live theatre, we are prepared for this practiced tradition of Western civilization going back to ancient Greece (although props and scenery were not invented until after 1600, and the position of scenic designer did not evolve until the 1920’s).


The risk of too much theatrical artificiality is a lurking threat behind this film, but it is to some extent salvaged by the performances of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Their singing voices are so-so but they dazzle when they dance, and Gosling cuts an eloquent profile at any piano. He is the perfect picture of the artist as a young man—romantic, angry, frustrated, a loner who is misunderstood even by the one woman who loves him. From the moment the characters of Mia and Sebastian meet, setbacks,  misunderstandings and financial concerns delay and frustrate their relationship until finally it fails. At the end of the film, a fantasy sequence replaying their entire romantic history in an idyllic version of how things might have been is a poetic testament to the harsh realities of life and how it interferes with the hopes and dreams of the individual. For the most part, the two lovers both achieve what they wished for, but the personal price was high. The poignant, old-fashioned nostalgia of the film is enhanced by the musical score, most especially the haunting refrains of the song “City of Stars,” sung by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling."

People acclaim this film for being real, but I just did not know how is that real. Only real for a middle-class white girl. Oh she comes from California, she dreams about NYC, she looks pretty, she has the most adorable extracurricular activity, she **** with the most popular boy in her school, so what? All I see is privilege, not universal reality. I highly doubt if any film critic in favor of this has saw A Raisin in the Sun. Beneatha is a self-centered college girl, which is super like Lady Bird. But Beneatha is not the protagonist of A Raisin in the Sun, which reflects the hopeless living condition of African American community in 60s. Moreover, in A Raisin in the Sun, the Youngers have more difficulties, and they can barely find a solution.

Et pourtant, pas mal de choses sonnent juste, comme par exemple cette idée que l'amour filial n'est certainement pas inné et que par ailleurs, des parents totalement irresponsables ont des enfants qu'ils sont incapables d'aimer et d'élever alors que d'autres -qui n'en ont pas-  sont des irresponsables qui savent prodiguer tout l'amour et l'éducation (à leur façon...) dont les mômes peuvent avoir besoin...

Bref, en ce bas monde, tout ne tombe pas à pic comme il faudrait, l'instinct maternel (ou paternel) n'étant pas distribué de façon... idéale ! alors évidemment, le petit bout de chou qui fait ici en quelque sorte la Cosette de service est une gamine touchante et cette ""famille"" de bric et de broc est tout-à-fait attachante ! pendant une bonne heure à peu près...

Mais la légèreté de cette première heure est sans doute précisément... trop légère et superficielle, comme détachée du réel, puis la réalité **** nos irresponsables non pas ""affreux, sales et méchants"" (non, rien à voir ici avec l'ironie viscérale et cruellement drôle du film italien !) mais jolis, propres et gentils !

Ce retour aux contingences du monde réel (et ""normal"" en somme) dans cette seconde partie du film s'avère peu crédible et -lui aussi- déconnecté de la réalité ou alors présenté de telle façon qu'on y croit pas une seule seconde... Finalement, on se demande si on se fout de nous, s'il s'agit d'une simple comédie sociale faite à la va-vite, d'un drame pleurnichard qui ne savait pas où il allait ou le résultat d'une incompétence généralisée...

D'autant que les deux heures sont clairement de trop, alourdissant énormément le propos et le drame familial par sa lenteur abrutissante... Cela étant, j'ignore si c'est volontaire ou non, mais les moments quasi-drolatiques sont assez nombreux, ma foi, notamment grâce aux comédiens très attachants eux aussi..."

El propósito de Shoplifters es importante, complejo y con un valor reflexivo enorme, sin embargo, su valor final está en el dilema moral (que solo propone) y no en la experiencia narrativa y cultural que trata de integrar a ese dilema.
Esta es una familia que puede ayudar y adoptar a una niña con quien solo ganan dilemas morales y económicos.
Con 2 horas de duración, Shoplifters le dedica 3/4 del tiempo a explorar esos dilemas y exponer una gran gama de emociones personales. Al principio es fácil dejare llevar por esa observación y admirar los detalles de un espacio oprimido en una cultura específica, pero la falta de tensión y la gran carga de sensibilidad provoca que la #película se vuelva pesada y menos conmovedora, aun cuando visualmente intriga el hecho de que puede agregar textura, temperatura y tamaño a la historia. Es hasta el último tercio cuando se presentan una serie de enigmas que no se introducen previamente de forma adecuada. A partir de ahí, la actuación se eleva minimamente para cooperar con un suspenso con poco sustento, pero que tiene éxito en plantear un dilema moral que, mientras más inocente sea el espectador del propósito, menos atención ganará.

At the beginning its easy to let go by that observation and admire the details of a repress space in a specific culture, but the lack of tension and the big deal of sensibility provokes that the #movie becomes heavy and each time less moving, even when visually intrigues the fact that it can add texture, temperature, and size to the story. It's until the last third when a series of enigmas are presented without being introduced properly. From there, the acting elevates minimally to cooperate with a suspense with little sustain, but it achieves to stipulate a moral dilemma that, while more innocent the spectator is of the porpoise, less attention it will have."

I read critics comparing this to Ozu, Mike Leigh, the Italian neo-realists or even Bresson. However Ozu and Bresson use a much more focused and minimalist cinematography that convey a far superior poetry and art. Some of the scenes feel as gratuitous and mostly used for shock-value for the Japanese middle-class audience (the introduction to the family home with the granny cutting toenails at the table is so ham-fisted than it becomes too farcical). Other critics say that you have to wait for the second part to see resolution. If that is a case, then the director commits the number crime in art: boredom! As for the other comments on ""humanism"" (heart-wrenching etc...) and ""naturalism"" or ""realism"", these actually confirm the lack of intrinsic artistic value of this film since ""mirroring the reality of those less fortunate"" reeks of the most hypocritical impulse of the middle-class, pity and commiseration."

This is a difficult film to watch for a number of reasons, the most prominent being that the script and the story it tells is confusing and almost impossible to follow. The last third of the film tries to explain who the characters really are and the motivations each has in relation to the other but this places too much of a burden on the audience who, for 2/3 of the film had to sit adrift and at sea in trying to find out exactly what is going on. Much like the critics of the artsy Ingmar Bergman movies, so many of the critics who loved this film saw more in it than I believe the writer/director ever intended. The editing room needed someone in it in addition to Mr. Koreeda in order to give objective cuts, segues and scene placement changes so that the story sought to be told would be more easily understood. In its present form, however, and bearing in mind the kindness of the season, I it a 6.0  with the responsibility for this low rating falling squarely on the shoulders (and probably the ego) of Mr. Koreeda."

His slightly absurd presence seems implausible and her reaction is surprisingly muted, however it's pretty obvious where this is headed.

601,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/toni-erdmann/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Spangle,"May 5, 2017",4,"Toni Erdmann is not a funny movie at all. It is cringe comedy for two hours and forty two minutes. This film is a major misfire that really flew right past me and made me wonder if everybody else was watching the same film I was. Immediately, I knew that this was a film that would likely not be my style once the character of Winfried Conradi / Toni Erdmann (Peter Simonischek) was introduced. With childish jokes left and right that are incomprehensible as jokes in the human realm, the film continuously shows his prank-influenced style of jokes in a nearly three hour long compilation of YouTube pranks. Going to Romania to try and make sure his daughter Ines (Sandra Huller) is enjoying life in the country, the film shows him try to get her cheer up and become less serious. While their relationship is nice, the film itself is really anything but for most of the runtime.

The jokes vary from being completely undetectable to being cringe-inducing when he ruins her business dealings in Romania to being just flat-out childish. Examples of each are when he tells the guy there is a bomb in a package, him creating the alter ego of Toni Erdmann who holds various titles and is all an inside joke where he pretends to be somebody else to creep on his daughter, or when he sits on a whoopy cushion. In essence, whoever conceived of the comedy in the film likely just finished watching an Adam Sandler movie and Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot. Considering I did not like the latter and Sandler movies are universally trash, there is no way Toni Erdmann was going to be a film I was going to enjoy with this style of comedy and awkward humor at its core. There was honestly not really a moment where I chuckled or came near smiling, except in sarcasm when I got progressively more-and-more aggravated that I was wasting nearly three hours of my life watching this schlock.

However, fortunately, its drama is very good at times. I still hate the father character who is one-note and has no idea how to relate to his daughter beyond making childish daughters. Meanwhile, his daughter is a serious businesswoman. Sure, I do not understand having that much passion for your career, but she does. Why is she the bad guy who just will not let her grating father into her life? He ****. I would cut him off too. What is worse is when his influence begins to rub off on her with the cringe-inducing naked party to build team chemistry. A last second decision to cover up her own error, the party is a failure and an intensely awkward at that. However, Toni Erdmann really saves itself in the final act with a raw and emotion-filled scene between Winfried and Ines where they discuss happiness and life. The two have finally come together again and no longer have that great distance between them, which is a nice thing to see. I just wish that Winfried was not eye gougingly annoying, which is he is not in his best moments such as at the egg painting party. Raw and open about who he is and how he wishes his daughter could lighten up, the audience can really root for the guy in this moment. Unfortunately, it is immediately followed up with him showing up to the naked party in a huge mascot outfit, which is a major turn off and plays too heavily on absurdist and awkward humor, considering his daughter is naked right in front of him.

However, the strong dramatic leanings of the film are undone with a gratuitous runtime that never really justifies itself. The film floats by for nearly three hours and I could never really figure out why it had done so. This is a film where I wish some American studio got their hands on it and cut it down from 162 minutes to 90 minutes. It never needed to be that long and needed to go under the knife for some serious liposuction. As it stands, it is a tall task to watch with practically no enjoyment in store whatsoever. It is not funny. Its drama borders on annoying until the final act. Its characters are all one-dimensional with Winfried being nothing but a goof ball who loved his dog and daughter, while Ines is just a stuck up **** of a businesswoman (a character trait that is becoming far too common nowadays, as if there is no middle ground between a woman who is passionate about her career and one who is just a callous **** who cuts jobs without blinking). Thus, even its character study inclinations fall flat and really reveal very little about the nature of the characters as individuals, only in the context of how they behave with one another.

Fortunately, it is this father-daughter relationship and both of their attempts to try and mend that broken link. However, the film is so unrelentingly unfunny, crude, and poorly written, its emotional core is nearly entirely blotted out. Had this film been a tight 90 minutes or a little more, it would have been far more enjoyable, as a lot of the fluff and annoying bits would have been cut out. Unfortunately, it is 162 minutes long and never seems likely to end."

Between Two Ferns: The Movie

I don't want to be that guy that thinks that one should stick to what they do. There is nothing wrong with trying something new. Whether it be physically, changing locations or genres or changing formats. On that note, the co-writer and director Scott Aukerman's film is a fresh peak behind the camera of a lovable show. This might be the pitch at the Netflix office. It should be it. What's best and the worst thing about the film, is the admiration they have for the lead character, the interviewer, Zach. They don't take him for granted. They don't want to lose him. And in order to do so, they are returning back to those old sitcom sugar coated schemes that gathered crowd like controversy does to media.

But it doesn't work. Not the fact that the interviewer Zach and the character Zach are completely different personalities. If anything that should have made it more grounding and fun to watch him play. Watch him juggle the on and off screen face twitch beautifully in the middle of this race against time chaos. And instead what has happened is that the crux, the thrill of those interviews have been snatched away from us.

Now, despite the insults are audaciously wrong and cuts deep to sensitive parts of the lives of these celebrities, the intention, the motif paints itself like a commercial strategy. A strategy that Will Ferrell explains and has based his empire on. The click bait theory is glorified by them inadvertently. And something that is actually menacingly taking over the authenticity over the data, the enormous amount of data flooded out in the world. Between Two Ferns: The Movie should have been a good weekend night out, instead we're stuck on Wednesday, a week day, working laboriously to finish what we have started. I don't need to be reminded that."

Here are the positives. The best part about this movie is that most of the celebrity interviews are pretty funny. The segments with Matthew McConaughey, John Legend, Paul Rudd, and Peter Dinklage are pretty funny while the other celebrity interviews are entertaining at best. There are some outtakes during the end credits that are funnier than most of the film. That’s kind of disappointing that your outtakes are funnier than most of your film. I think Zach Galifianakis does a good job with what he is given and helps keep this film afloat. The film has this mockumentary feel for it and the camera work compliments that. It’s shot in a way a mockumentary would be and it’s refreshing. The film can be self aware at some points and doesn’t try to make itself bigger than what it is supposed to be. The film does what it needs to do and then it is over. Here are the negatives. The story is kind of lame. It’s another one of those “redemption stories because a character did something embarrassing” that has been done to death. The film doesn’t do anything to establish itself as something different.  Everything other than the celebrity interviews is incredibly boring and starts to drag heavily. Fortunately, as it starts to drag even heavily, it switches to another celebrity interview. This also leads to a weird structure issue though. It does start to feel out of place when it changes so suddenly but it does lead to better scenes. About 75% of the jokes aren’t that funny which is unfortunate since it is a comedy film. Like I said earlier, I got a bunch of laughs out of the outtakes than I did most of the film. The editing for this film feels very amateurish. It has a bunch of quick cuts that are distracting and obnoxious. This also leads to a pacing issue. It’s weirdly paced due to the quick cuts and awkward structure. It’s these issues that really drag the film down. Overall, Between Two Ferns: The Movie has some funny sequences but is held back by a cookie cutter story, lots of boring moments, and awkward pacing. I give Between Two Ferns: The Movie a 4/10."

Ian McKellen looked more the part as the earl of Southampton, I thought.
There are definitely some poignant moments but there are relatively dull moments too. Of course the story of Shakespeare's young son dying and him not being there to witness it, is a sad one - its nothing to trivialise at all, certainly. I believe this film was written by Ben Elton and I could see that it perhaps inspired him to go on to write the BBC TV sitcom 'Upstart Crow' - indeed, Shakespeare is called precisely that during the film. There is some nice scenery, so that's a plus as well but I did think the script could perhaps have been improved, as on ocassion it felt a little slow and without a real structure. I reckon it's worth sticking with, as it becomes most poignant right towards the end but if your not keen on period dramas, or interested in Shakespeare, then its not really worth seeing. Also, I should point out that it is a fictionalised account of what happened during the final years of Shakespeare's life, after the famous Globe theatre was burnt to the ground. The irony of the film being called 'All Is True' has not passed me by(!). It does provide food for thought but I wouldn't say its one of my favourite films of this sort (costume/period dramas), no. If your a fan of Judi Dench, however, I would recommend it and if your interested in a pre-Upstart Crow Shakespeare film written by Ben Elton."

Directed, produced by, and starring Kenneth Branagh, All Is True is a pleasant enough film obviously born from great reverence, but is also clumsily episodic in structure, and relatively free of conflict, focusing instead on non-incident. By the very nature of the years during which it takes place (1613-1616), Ben Elton's screenplay is full of interpolations and suppositions, some of which are interesting, but many of which don't work. There's a much better film hidden in the contours of All Is True, a darker story examining Shakespeare's (Branagh) psychology; his inability to process the death of his son Hamnet (Sam Ellis), his guilt over the fact that he put his career ahead of his family, his possible misogyny, his obsession with his legacy. These issues are in the background, but they are not the focus, and whilst All Is True is perfectly fine, it's also perfectly forgettable.

Possibly a palette-cleanser for Branagh, allowing him to return to the familiarity of Shakespeare, after several years working on relatively impersonal projects, and with two blockbusters on the way, All Is True begins on June 29, 1613, as Shakespeare watches the Globe Theatre burn to the ground, after a canon misfired during a performance of All Is True. Devastated, he retires and returns home to Stratford. Coldly received by his wife Anne (Judi Dench) and youngest daughter, Judith (Kathryn Wilder), he gets a slightly better welcome from his eldest, Susanna (Lydia Wilson). Still mourning the death of Judith's twin, his only son, who died from plague aged 11 in 1596, Shakespeare decides to grow a garden to honour his memory. However, he must also try to deal with Judith's hatred for him, stemming from her conviction that he believes the wrong twin died.

Easily the best in the film, involves Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton (Ian McKellen) visiting Stratford. Discussing his identity as the ""fair youth"" to whom Shakespeare addresses the first 126 sonnets, Shakespeare quotes in its entirety Sonnet 29, with Branagh reading it as an agonised ode to an impossible love. Southampton then also recites the poem, with McKellen's intonation changing it into a celebration of the power of art to transcend such foolish distractions as love. It's a beautifully shot, incredibly well acted, and nuanced scene that, if it accomplishes nothing else, serves to remind us just what talented actors can do when reciting the exact same text.

One of the film's main themes is, of course, family, with Elton's script focusing on how resentful Anne and Judith have become of Shakespeare. We don't know a great deal about the real Judith, so much of Elton's characterisation is speculative. The film's Judith is a protofeminist, a brilliant woman railing against the narrow-minded patriarchy her father endorses. The likelihood of this being the case is slim at best, but Wilder is excellent in the part and makes Judith much more believable than the character has any right to be. The film acknowledges that Shakespeare was a neglectful father and husband, and never fully gets behind him as he defends himself by citing the cultivation of his genius. However, by the end, even he doesn't believe this himself, coming to understand the price his family paid for his greatness.

However, there are some considerable problems. First and foremost is the script, which employs an extremely episodic organisational principal, with scene after scene addressing one and only one issue at a time, ensuring each issue is cleared before moving onto the next. Scenes often involve the characters saying only what is necessary to get to the next scene, with little room to breathe, almost as if we're watching a ""previously on"" montage of a TV show.

The casting is also problematic. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Dench and McKellen as much as the next man, but that doesn't change the fact that they are both badly miscast. Both play their characters as elderly, but in 1613-1616, Anne (played by the 84-year-old Dench) was 57-60, and Southampton (played by the 79-year-old McKellen) was only 40-43. Additionally, Anne was six years older than Shakespeare, but Dench is 26 years older than Branagh, and it shows, serving only to distract from the content.

As a Kenneth Branagh fan (and a fan of Ben Elton's Upstart Crow (2016)), I was disappointed with All Is True. The film tries to strike a balance between a laid-back and **** story about a retired writer, and a study of filial grief. Some elements unquestionably work; the Southampton scene, Shakespeare's struggle to reconcile his genius with the personal cost of that genius, Judith's resentment of Hamnet. But a lot doesn't work. It's an inoffensive and perfectly fine film, but given the director and the subject, it could, and should, have been so much better."

638,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/doctor-sleep/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,BryanAndrew,"Apr 9, 2020",6,"'Doctor Sleep' is personally a disappointing sequel to the iconic cult classic 'The Shining', that sways toward being an superhero-eque action thriller rather than a psychological horror, and yet drags on way more than it should have, filled with unfulfilled build-up and directionless dialogue that poorly attempts to convey a deeper meaning. The plot of the film, although comparatively broader than that of 'The Shining', opts for a more shallow and straight-forward storytelling style. The acting was also rather dull and fails to evoke any sense of fear or desperation in the otherwise horrendous situations that the characters find themselves in. The set and costume/makeup design of the film's rendition of the Overlook Hotel and its ghostly residents is certainly nostalgic but fails to bring anything new to the table despite being almost 40 years apart from the original film; the same goes for the movie's run-of-the-mill cinematography and bland sound design. The visual effects of the 'astral projection' scenes toward the early middle of the film were promising and actually entertaining to behold but the film detracts from that later on in the film and we are left with sloppy CGI scenes later on. All-in-all, the film is still an interesting watch for those who enjoy thrillers and those who are fond of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, but don't expect anything that would evoke anywhere close to the same level of disturbance or terror as the classic film did back in 1980. 'Doctor Sleep' scores a 6.25/10."

I mean, I was having a blast once Johnny was busting the keys for 'I'm Still Standing', but the final number was easily my least favourite. And I'm not a big 'Shake it off' fan either. However, I definitely enjoyed this more than 'The Secret Life of Pets', the animation is pretty good, and some of the characters are relatable, even if it feels like Illumination was trying to force some relatability with them. There's some talented voice actors in there, and it's funny enough, overall leading it to be a decent kill of 90 minutes. But I have many problems with this movie. Firstly, why are they animals? They could just as easily be people and the plot would not be different in any way. At least with Zootopia the plot was heavily dependant on the fact that they were all animals, but not here. I also found Buster Moon's financial problems uninteresting, and a lot of the character arks are predictable and mundane. It's also hard to flesh them out given the amount of them there are, with little to no character interaction.

Based around something as universally understood as music, Sing seems to be an appropriate first-time directing effort by the duo Christopher Lourdelet and Garth Jennings (who directed live action before). The result of their hard work brings a passable accomplishment by the studio’s sixth ever full-length feature, even if no studio gamechanger nonetheless.

The feature takes place in an unnamed San Fran-Los Angeles-esque city painted by Miami, home to many anthropomorphic mammals, reptiles, birds, primates, household pets, cephalopods, arachnids, and whales. We focus on six mammals: one a producer, five the lucky choices for his theater-saving singing competition. Plenty celebrity voices deliver occasionally terrific singing, although the minor roles’ unfitting voices draw back the overall quality. Surprisingly however, the anthropomorphic individuals’ subplots are all masterfully balanced in their yearnings on the road to fame and fortune:

Buster Moon the koala (Matthew McConaughey) wants to keep the theater financially stable after his father passed down the torch. Despite being the lead, he is the least interesting cast member, more existing to vocalize the cliché morals. Though he still plays great off the more colorful characters, including his dimwitted senior secretary, Miss Crawly the iguana.

Rosita the pig (Reese Witherspoon) wants to follow her passion away from her uncaring husband and twenty-five children. She soon meets unexpected challenges when the competition pairs her with an overly optimistic pig named Gunter. This widely marketed chunk of ham shockingly gets little stage time; and I should also mention how he flaunts an indistinguishable European accent exaggerated to the point of annoyance. The immature will worship him like Moccus, leaving adults to gag a bit while watching an overweight swine in a unitard stereotyping western culture.

Johnny the gorilla (Taron Egerton) wants to escape his father’s criminal lifestyle, and follow his heart for the microphone. Boys across all ages will relate to this highly soulful musician, despite a phoned in resolution to his subplot.

Ash the porcupine (Scarlett Johansson) seeks public appreciation alongside her boyfriend/musical partner. While her story feels relatively unengaging compared to the others, she still brings a nice voice, especially when her guitar strums electrify her quills to the point of showering out.

Mike the mouse (Seth MacFarlane) needs the prize money to pay back a bear gang who see him as a tasty meal. His ratty account maybe could have benefited from higher stakes against the law; but it does not matter anyway, for this crude comedian providing the voice amazingly makes a tiny crooner so ruggedly lovable with some spice thrown in.

Meena the elephant (Tori Kelly) cannot pursue her love for singing, as her glossophobia gets in the way, with no thanks to her arrogant grandfather. She has the most poorly balanced yet easily relatable experience for all the boys and girls facing a similar fear.

Together, doubt gets conquered in a unified walk to fame and fortune. So who ends up winning the competition?

It doesn’t matter! They are all too introspective to notice one another, as these well-rounded individual stories have zero interweaving amongst one another. In the end, Sing cares less about teamwork, and more about getting children to worship the most popular hits by Lady GaGa, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Carly Rae Jepsen, and everyone else out there (just stay through the credits, the list of songs used lasts over a minute). It doesn’t matter if the human artist singles are sung by cute little animals; accompanied by predictable fart jokes, evidence proves why this movie aims squarely toward kids with an affinity of music over rules, offering the parents nothing more than a few scattered chuckles to at least manage without booing the artist offstage."
648,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sing/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,LeopoldTheBrave,"Apr 2, 2017",6,"I like this movie A LOT for some reason. I know it's only mediocre at best. But there's something that keeps making me come back to it. There's LOTS of positives, but a negative for each one.

For example, all the characters are very likable, but because there are so many, we barely get to spend a lot of time with them.

The movie is paced very well at the start, letting us get to know all the characters we'll be seeing throughout the movie. But it falls a bit at the end when it focuses a bit too much on Meena, the most generic of the lovable cast as she just plays the role of ""The shy girl.""

The animation is fantastic. There's a wide variety in character design, and the environment looks great. You can really see yourself in the city or town where the movie takes place. But that's also a problem. While it's pretty, it has no creativity. You could replace all the animals with humans, and they could live in this world perfectly fine. While I do prefer this movie over Zootopia's overly forced message, predictability, and mediocre characters, they at least got the creativity in the animation correct.

Overall, I find Sing to be a very enjoyable movie, but I am aware of its flaws. I'd definitely recommend it over Secret Life of Pets, Zootopia, or any other talking animal movie that came out in 2016. (Except Kung fu Panda 3. Nothing beats that. Ever.) Without borrowing the plot of Toy Story like Secret Life of Pets, or a forced message that reminds you how **** the world is for 100 minutes and makes you feel all melancholy like Zootopia, Sing is able to pull you into its happy world and distract you for a good bit. Not the kind of distraction that you'd sit your kids in front of to quiet them down for a while, but a good distraction that you'd enjoy watching with your kids to pass some time on a rainy day."

650,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lizzie/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,Bertaut1,"Jan 1, 2019",6,"Could do with a bit more vitality, but the acting is superb

Written by Bryce Kass, and directed by Craig William Macneill, Lizzie is based on the case of Lizzie Borden, who was accused and subsequently acquitted of the axe murders of her father and stepmother in Massachusetts in 1892. A revisionist take on the material, the film presents Borden as a protofeminist lashing out against patriarchal oppression, homophobia, and sexual assault. And although the languid pace will alienate many, whilst the liberties it takes with historical facts will irk others, there is much to praise here.

One of most interesting aspects of Lizzie is its narrative structure. Beginning on August 4 just as the (unseen) bodies are discovered, it then flashes back six months to the arrival of housemaid Bridget Sullivan (Kristen Stewart), building up to August 4 again. This time we see the bodies, but not the murders. It then jumps forward to the trial, before once again flashing back to August 4, this time showing us the actual killing. This structure allows the film to briefly cover the trial, whilst still employing the murders as the dénouement. It also allows the narrative to build tension around an event which the audience already knows is coming.

Aesthetically, Noah Greenberg's cinematography is particularly laudable. The film rarely ventures outside the Borden house, with the photography giving rise to a restrictive and claustrophobic mise en scène. Often framing Borden in windows, doorways, and behind railings, whilst using shallow focus to flatten backgrounds, the sense is that this is a woman living a confined life with little room to move. When she first kisses the maid, Bridget Sullivan (Kristen Stewart), the camera pulls back to reveal that Lizzie's father Andrew (Jamey Sheridan) is watching them - even in this moment of release, they are still trapped in his domain.

Assisting Greenberg's photography is Ruy García's sound design. Of particular note are the floorboards, which creak with the slightest touch, making any kind of clandestine interaction between Borden and Sullivan virtually impossible, and thus contributing to the sense of the household as a prison. Enhancing this even further, is the lack of aural warmth, with footsteps and voices echoing and bouncing off the walls due to the lack of soft surfaces.

As a narrative of female empowerment (albeit of the homicidal variety), most of the film's main themes relate to combating the patriarchal strictures of the Gilded Age, represented primarily by Andrew, his brother-in-law John (Denis O'Hare), and his wife Abby (Fiona Shaw), who reinforces patriarchal hypocrisy by unquestioningly submitting to it. Presenting Borden as a woman driven to her wit's end, with few practical options in a society that looks down on her because she is unwed and in her 30s, the film depicts a free-spirit living in a cage, yearning for agency, a protofeminist actively rebelling against the dominion of men. Presenting her and Sullivan's relationship as an illicit romance which they had to hide because of the moral bigotry of the age, the film adopts a #MeToo sensibility, as they fight back against self-righteous judgement, unchecked abuse, and socially sanctioned oppression.

There are, however, some sizeable problems. For one, the film lacks energy, and the slow pacing will leave some viewers bored to tears. Additionally, apart from Sevigny and Stewart, the rest of the cast is wasted. Perhaps the most egregious problem, however, is that the film seems as war with itself. On the one hand, it wants to be an elegant, period-appropriate tale of women attempting to take their destinies into their own hands, but on the other, it wants to present a modern story of murder and homosexual women. At times, such as the superb depiction of the murders themselves, you can feel the modern sensibilities rise to the surface, but for the most part, they're stifled by the hushed austerity of a more muted milieu. Additionally, Kass's script tips the scale in Borden's favour too much (Andrew is not just an authoritarian homophobe, but a rapist; there's also John's creepy intimations, Abby's refusal to stand up for her step-daughters, and Borden's protofeminist humanitarianism). Weighing the scales so decisively drains the film of ambiguity and much of its vitality, presenting a binary story of righteous good slaying hypocritical evil, rather than a murder with many facets. Lizzie tells the story of an initially powerless victim who lashes out and, quite literally, slays patriarchal authority. A Gothic tale told from a #MeToo perspective, it tries to be many things at once - a revisionist history, a feminist tract, a championing of homosexuality, a murder mystery, a period drama - but ends up kind of falling into a no man's land between genres. Still though, there are aspects that are enjoyable, if you can look past the enervating pace."

That's the angle of this latest take on notorious axe murderer Lizzie Borden. Chloë Sevigny plays the frustrated daughter with her typically flat delivery. The combination of her amorous relationship with the house maid (Kristen Stewart) and the increasingly cruel actions of her father drive her to the legendary hacking. There's a lovely period ambience that's echoed by the subdued period pacing. While danger bubbles under the surface, it never builds to any sort of boiling point. Somber and subdued makes for an interesting story, but not much of an emotionally compelling one."

I can say for a Netflix movie it isn't terrible. I know that is glowing praise, but if I were to pay to see this in theaters I would be less then generous to it. The Lovebirds is a romantic comedy where if you watch the trailer you have seen all the jokes basically. That is a huge problem that trailer had me thinking that this film was going to be a side splitting good time. Instead I got a passable comedy. I do mean it is passable due to the fact you will laugh at some of the jokes... but not many. The plot focuses on a couple who end up being accessories to a murder from a guy claiming to be a cop, and the comedy ensues. Some may find Kumail Nanjiani annoying due to how he is complaining the entire film. It didn't bother me, but be warned he is the exact character he was in Stuber.

This was a little hard to rate as the film equally has stuff I liked and disliked.

Jokes are hit-and-miss. The funniest parts are derived from investigating the mystery (we know who did it but not why.) Things can get dark, and it is at the sure unexpectedness of this darkness that the movie works best.

The jokes that don't work are often at the points that the focus is more on the personal lives of the characters, which isn't as strong. There is a conflict set up between the couple that never feels real enough. It doesn't help that the jokes are often stretched. So if you don't like one, expect it to go on for a while. There is a little too much observational humor and the characters overreacting to things.

Though they can't make the weak bit work, Rae and Nanjiani are good in this and have chemistry together.

I was on the fence about how I felt about this. I actually recommend you watch this because I feel that there'd be a good amount of people who'd prefer this more than me. Even if you don't like it, I think it's more likely to be a miss with you rather than something you outright dislike."

After all, the screenplay was written by Ginsburg’s nephew, Daniel Stiepelman, whose script was discussed, reviewed and edited by Ginsburg and her daughter, Jane.  Despite this inside information and the artistic license granted this fictionalized version of Ginsburg’s life, the resulting movie does not compare favorably to last year’s more comprehensive, more powerful documentary “R.B.G.”

It’s curious that the film focuses so narrowly – a few scenes of Ginsburg at Harvard Law, her early days in NYC beginning in 1959 and an emphasis on her first major gender equality case, Moritz v. IRS, which was argued before the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in 1972.  Between 1973 and 1976, Ginsburg argued six gender discrimination cases before the US Supreme Court, five of them successfully.  One wonders why the film focuses solely on the beginning of her work on gender equality, while giving no real attention to the legal precedents she helped create for women over succeeding years.  For many, it is Ginsburg’s relentless pursuit of gender equality, accomplished case by case, brick by brick, that has made her so admired.  However, this narrow focus does allow the film to paint a painfully vivid picture of the barriers she had to overcome.  According to this film, women didn’t just cope with glass ceilings, in many cases they lived in glass cages.

In general, the cast is first-rate.  As Marty Ginsburg, the ever-supportive spouse, Armie Hammer taps into the same thoughtful, soulful character for which he received a Golden Globe nomination last year for “Call Me By Your Name.”  At key points, Cailee Spaeny, as Ginsburg’s daughter Jane, offers a refreshingly in-your-face activism and assertiveness.  Jane’s personal power shows clearly that the gift of independent thought and capacity to question everything – which RBG received from her mother – was passed on to the next generation.  Unfortunately, Felicity Jones in the lead role just seems out of place.  Jones was wonderful as Stephen Hawking’s wife in “The Theory of Everything” (2014).  Here, she seems to be laboring to tone down her irrepressible perkiness.  Or, perhaps, it’s just that RBG, in this rendering, is just so humorless.

The film is particularly incapable of treating the traditionalists who oppose feminism as anything other than bad caricatures.  In one early scene, Law School Dean Erwin Griswold (Sam Waterston) invites the nine female member of the incoming class to dinner at his home.  Once seated, he asks each to introduce herself and explain why she is taking the place of a deserving man.  It all comes across with the subtle nuance of Gallagher hitting a watermelon with a sledgehammer.

Many years ago, I recall my father, a thoughtful, decent man, saying that he would be willing to help fund higher educator for his granddaughters “should they prove educable.”  From today’s perspective, it’s jarring to think about that stereotype permeating the thinking of reasonable people.  As much as any other individual today, Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been responsible for changing that point of view.  Unfortunately, “On the Basis of Sex,” fails to do her justice."
664,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/on-the-basis-of-sex/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Jan 7, 2019",6,"On the evening news they announced, that for the first time in her 25 years as a Supreme Court Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg would miss hearing oral arguments but would read all the notes taken and vote as was expected of her. After two operations for cancer and bouts of chemo she still shows the fortitude that saw her through a life of having to prove herself.

""On The Basis of Sex"" opens with Ginsberg attending a class of Harvard Law School, only one of nine women in a class of more than 500 men. We see the happy and equal, possibly more equal for her, marriage with her loving, smart husband who knows his wife can do anything she wants and he is there to back her up. For the first hour of the film we see had badly women were treated in the work force, along in many other aspects of everyday life, the comfortable marriage of the Ginsbergs, their children of which the oldest is a daughter who seems to motivate her mother to go a step further than she might be ready to go and how it lead to the Supreme Court.

It is in the last 45 minutes that we see Ginsburg in 1975 arguing her first case regarding gender equality but it is for a man, not a woman, who as a caretaker for his mother has been denied $296 as a tax deduction.

""On The Basis of Sex"" is written by Ruth Bader Ginsberg's nephew, Daniel Stiepleman, but as much research as I did I wasn't able to find out who his parents were but he obviously admired, if not worshiped, Martin and Ruth Ginsburg so both are presented as perfect people.

Felicity Jones as Ruth Bader Ginsburg really has a one note role but adds what she can to it. Anyone who saw last years documentary ""RBG"" or has seen her interviewed knows the lady is certainly not a one note person. Armie Hammer, as Martin, is excellent as the man who believes in his wife while Cailee Spaeny does a standout job as their teenage daughter Jane.

Though it is hard, at first, to accept Sam Waterston as the hard, condescending Dean of Harvard Erwin Griswold, he is just one of the men who thought as he did, including the 3 judges who hear Ginsburg's gender discrimination case.

Along with Hammer, Justin Theroux, as a ACLU lawyer, and Christian Mulkey, as the defendant in the  case, are effective in playing the 'good guys'.

Kathy Bates in the role of Dorothy Kenyon, an early civil liberties fighter, lawyer and judge, shines in her two scenes.

The director, Mimi Leder, does a by the numbers job and somewhere along the line the production staff saw a 'blue' New York. Clothes, signs, lights, door fronts, let alone Ginsburg's major outfit, is blue!

""On The Basis of Sex"" is an enjoyable love story, an interesting gender civil rights lesson, but most of all it shows how a person, a woman, lead a successful life in spite of all that was thrown in her way and gave us a woman who today is admired by many, including her enemies who want to get her off the Court which is a compliment.

I recommend a double bill movie night of ""On The Basis of Sex"" for a Hollywood version of Ruth Baded Ginsburg and ""RBG"" to discover who the woman was yesterday and is today."

Or à la suite d'un concours de circonstances impromptu, voilà-t-y pas qu'il flingue le fiston très con de son parrain... pour protéger son fiston à lui qu'il ne voit plus depuis des années !

Alors, pensez donc, le parrain a beau être un pote de 30 ans de notre pauvre Liam, il n'en est pas moins super vénère : il réclame sa tête mais aussi celle de son fils (le fils de l'alcoolo irlandais -pléonasme-, j'espère que vous suivez quand même) parce qu'il est du genre ""dent pour dent"" et qu'en plus il a la dent dure, le vieux mafieux.

Et putain, il est vieux le parrain incarné avec aplomb par Ed Harris, dans les 80 piges au compteur environ mais on ne compte plus à cet âge-là. D'ailleurs, notre grand Liam ne se fait plus tout jeune lui non plus et le retraité enchaîne les bastons et les fusillades comme un jeune chien fou dans un jeu de quilles. Papy, tu vois, il envoit du bois.

Un flicard a aussi la dent dure à son égard, joué par Vincent D'Onofrio, préretraité ou presque, vétéran de ""New York section criminelle"", mais également le marquant ""Engagé Baleine"" de... Full Metal Jacket ! oué ça remonte à... pffiou !

Attendez, ce n'est pas terminé, un autre Papy fait une apparition, quasi-fantomatique : on dirait Dieu le père en personne, environ 90 balais... ouais, c'est bien Nick Nolte, vous ne rêvez pas ! il m'a fait peur.

Alors le film qui se déroule surtout la nuit se veut un modèle de rédemption des truands à qui on apprend plus à faire la grimace... et bien sûr la rivalité de deux fortes personnalités qui se respectent mais s'affrontent à cause des circonstances. Certes, ce n'est pas Heat mais on sent une inspiration assez nette à cet égard.

Si l'histoire tient ma foi tout-à-fait debout, elle titube sensiblement dans la psychologie de ses personnages trop exagérée, trop forcée et le scénario qui aligne poursuites et bastons sans crier gare est du même acabit : on se sent un peu trop souvent dans une stathamerie ou autre production Luc Besson, ce qui n'est pas un compliment, non, non...

Pour autant, on ne s'ennuie jamais là-dedans et nos vieux donnent le meilleur d'eux-mêmes, Liam et Ed en premier : leur expérience crève l'écran. On passerait même l'éponge sur le caractère outrancier du film si sa réalisation était au moins à la hauteur, ce qu'elle n'est pas avec son montage cut et zoomé, rendant l'action confuse et désordonnée.

Il reste un film pas désagréable avec quelques moments touchants mais globalement dépassé par son ambition : la rédemption du truand est en effet un sujet difficile et délicat qui ne souffre pas la médiocrité... Trop emporté, Night Run n'a pas acquis la sagesse nécessaire."

Overall, I liked this movie, and I think it represents a decent ending to the Bridget Jones trilogy. It's not a very good movie, but it's warm, it has a funny story and gives us back most of the characters we like. Personally, I like this movie more than its predecessor, which seemed more worn and soulless. In this movie, the unthinkable happens and Bridget got pregnant… but she doesn't know who the father is! On the one hand, it could be Mark Darcy, her eternal love, but it could also be Jack, a one-night stand she had at a festival.

The movie is predictably the last in which we'll see Bridget Jones and her adventures. Not only is the formula already quite worn out, but the actors have also aged and are now on another level of their lives. The biggest problem with this film, in fact, is the predictability of its script, where we can foresee with some certainty what will happen. Even who is the child's father! The jokes are nothing new, but sometimes they work, and the film is not happy about making us laugh, but it also doesn't upset us either. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the same chemistry among the trio of main actors that was observed in the past. The film has a series of uninteresting sub-plots, placed to fill time and space, because nothing relevant comes from any of them.

Again, Renee Zellwegger returns to one of the characters that brought her notoriety and fortune, but the actress already accuses her age, with visible wrinkles and a lack of joviality that the character also gradually assumes. She is a good actress, however, and gives us another very competent job, closing in the best way her work. At his side, a mature but elegant Colin Firth remains fresh and impeccable in the role of Darcy. Cast in this film, Patrick Dempsey did a satisfying job, but somewhat lukewarm, as was his character, an algorithmic intellectual who made his fortune with a social networking site. Emma Thompson is a good comedian, but the character is too serious for her to really put to use the comedic skills we recognize in her. Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent are safe bets, but they are rarely really taken advantage of. Sarah Solemani is also a nice addition, but also adds little to the film.

Once again, the film takes on its British credits with a discreet but effective and functional cinematography, making the best use of the good scenery and also the excellent filming locations selected for the film. We have a good balance of light and shadow, good colors and excellent editing, with the film not wasting time or dragging. The costumes are also very good, and the soundtrack does its job well, without standing out or disappointing."

Helen Fielding’s down-to-earth 20/30/40-something creation is back, still struggling with life, and about to embark on her most extravagant adventure yet – a baby, whose paternal genes she’s not quite sure.

What did I think?

Let me start with a disclaimer – I hate Renee Zellweger in this role. I loved the books, and always thought the casting was deeply offensive to legions of great British actresses – her ridiculously twitching terribly-accented Bridget did nothing for me. Surprising, then, that I found this sequel to be rather good. Zellweger’s now utterly-toxin-ravaged face is difficult to watch, and she still overplays Jones obscenely, but there are some seriously funny – proper “pah!” LOL moments – and some brilliant turns from Colin Firth, Patrick Dempsey and, particularly, Emma Thompson as the obstetrician who, God bless her, is aging beautifully (i.e. naturally).

It drags a bit – two hours?? – but it’s got just enough of the good stuff to keep you going, thanks in no small part to Fielding’s work on the screenplay and Shazzer picking up the director’s reins once again. I’m shocking myself by saying this, but it’s worth a watch!"

She is thinner than before, has a good job as a TV producer and without any prospects in the romance department. One of her past suitors, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) has died and she broke up with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) who got married.

As only as movies can do it Mark reappears in her life just as a new man Jack Qwant (Patrick Dempsey) appears, she goes to bed with both (NO! Not at the same time!) and guess what happens! (Read the title of the film folks!) We, she and they spend the next hour and a half (out of 2 hours) trying to figure which one is the father. Yes there is an easy way to find out who the father is but then there would be no movie.

Should you not be able to figure out who the father is by the scene in the Italian restaurant you haven’t seen a lot of movies.

Zellweger’s British accent gets a little too heavy at times, Dempsey seems to never have shaved during the movie constantly having that ugly 5 o’clock shadow and Firth’s saving grace is that he holds back with the smiles so when he shows one he lights up the film.

The supporting cast does their job and the film provides a few, very few, laughs, some slapstick and almost no feelings.

Kevin Spacey being cast as Richard Nixon was a perfect fit. Michael Shannon as Elvis was a odd choice but Michael is a great actor and he pulled it off. The movie was surprisingly very funny.

684,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/elvis-nixon/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,ScarlettMi,"Nov 23, 2016",6,"This movie is saved by the strength of Michael Shannon's performance. Kevin Spacey is good as well, but if it weren't for the deep sense of melancholy that surrounds Shannon's Elvis, I don't think the film would have had any weight to it at all.

There are a couple of chuckles to be had here and there based around the absurdity of the life that Elvis leads and the juxtaposition of him and Nixon. Certainly that has to be part of the reason why the picture of the two of them that inspired this movie proves so popular. The way Elvis disarms and interacts with Nixon made for an entertaining exchange. Neither man comes across as very relatable but we can understand why they might relate to one another.

The movie never really takes off, but in the end it does work to paint a sad and affecting portrait of Elvis. I haven't checked, but it felt as though it was adapted from a stage play. Whenever Michael Shannon was given the opportunity to just talk for a bit, the movie was at its strongest. I also thought the relationship with Jerry was well done in showing what it would be like to live alongside someone who constantly **** up all the oxygen in whatever room he's in but still makes you feel special for having been there.

It's a solid character study of Elvis but whenever the story veers away from Shannon, the film gets weaker."

Much more in-line with the original film, to the point that nothing is mentioned of the wacky sequel, Cars 3 is a natural, role-reversing progression of the themes presented during the franchise's first lap. It can be blunt and obvious, but at heart this is a kid's movie and I appreciate the effort to mix a little extra meaning into the destruction derbies and Hot Wheel paint jobs.

The whole package looks great, as one might expect from a major Pixar effort. There's a ton of variety in the scenery, which is just stunning (the cars themselves occasionally seem glaringly flat by contrast), and the race scenes (particularly McQueen's big crash at the end of the first act) are vivid enough that you'd be forgiven for overlooking the giant eyeballs behind each windscreen.

I wouldn't place it in the pantheon of studio greats, but it's at least a deserving successor to Cars 1, if not an essential conclusion to that story. They could've just doubled down on Tow Mater and his international slapstick hijinx, raked in the bucks and called it a day, but instead we received something a little more contemplative and deserving of a feature-length.

The racing sequences are particularly well-executed, capturing the speed and intensity of the track. However, it's not a groundbreaking leap forward from the first film, feeling more like a pit stop for the animation studio rather than a triumphant return to form.

Soundtrack:
Now, the soundtrack. Much like the first film, ""Cars 3"" sticks with a country-tinged sound, bringing back the familiar tones of Americana. While it may not reach the heights of Pixar's best musical offerings, it complements the film's racing theme and provides a steady backdrop without becoming a distracting pit crew member.

Story and Characters
Let's talk about the narrative. ""Cars 3"" brings Lightning McQueen back into the driver's seat, but this time he's facing the inevitable: aging and newer, sleeker models. The film attempts to explore themes of mentorship, legacy, and the passage of time, injecting some much-needed depth into the series. However, the narrative feels somewhat formulaic, hitting familiar beats that we've seen in countless sports movies. It's like they took a page from the underdog playbook and followed it to the letter.

Themes
Now, the themes. Cars 3 tries to deliver a message about the importance of passing the torch, but it occasionally veers into overly sentimental territory. 

The film's attempt to balance nostalgia with a fresh perspective is commendable, but it doesn't quite achieve the emotional resonance of Pixar's more impactful **** the grand Pixar spectrum, ""Cars 3"" is a respectable comeback after the wrong turn of ""Cars 2."" It steers the franchise back towards the emotional resonance that Pixar is known for, even if it doesn't break any new ground. 

It's a solid conclusion to the trilogy, giving Lightning McQueen a fitting farewell lap. It's a competent sequel that puts the series back on track, but it lacks the innovative spark of Pixar's best work."

Again, I blame myself for missing out the fun for not knowing them very well. It never occurred to me before. I have seen many films that proceeded by its television series which I haven't seen. It looked short and the pace was excellent, so I did not get bored, except not getting the overall film properly. Otherwise, I would have rated it better. I think the people like me should be careful while picking it. Other than that it is an okay film, not a bad film.

705,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/absolutely-fabulous-the-movie/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,madmovieman,"Nov 29, 2016",5,"It’s very rare for a sitcom to really translate well onto the big screen, and this is unfortunately yet another example. Whilst I think the original Ab Fab series is great fun, this feature-length edition a good decade and and a half later on from the original run’s end is far from any of the laughs that made the show so fun. With a dull screenplay and poor comedy (not to mention the cardinal sin of celebrity cameos), Absolutely Fabulous The Movie is anything but.

Now, the biggest issue with the film is that it’s just not that funny. I’ll admit there are a couple of laughs here and there, but nothing hugely memorable or good enough to get you in the mood for a great comedy. In the show, so much of the humour came from Patsy and Eddie’s excessively narcissistic personalities, as well as their unorthodox relationship with Saffy, Eddie’s daughter.

However, rather than being able to laugh at all of that, this film makes all of the show’s best qualities simply irritating. Similarly to a couple of revival episodes over the past few years, the film is a consistently underwhelming and irritating watch, because it rehashes old jokes again and again, and also indulges itself in the modern era in a way that doesn’t suit its characters or situation at all. It’s a format that seemed to work back in the 90s, but doesn’t translate well into the present.

Whilst Joanna Lumley, Jennifer Saunders and Julia Sawalha all put in the same shifts as they did in the original show, the script here just means they’re not as entertaining. The predictability of so many of the jokes right from the start makes everything feel so lacklustre, and it’s very difficult to keep interested or hopeful over the course of 90 minutes, instead of 30.

This film is in general a big mess. The script’s comedy is very poor, and the story isn’t much better, featuring a billion conveniences just to get the characters into ‘hilarious’ situations. It used to feel so organic and simple, but the plot here feels incredibly manufactured and predictable, another hugely disappointing element.

And then, there’s the nail in the coffin: the celebrity cameos. Of all the worst things a film can do, this always shows a script that’s got no ideas, and is simply relying on an equivalent of fan service to get laughs out of you. In a horribly similar way to this year’s other celebrity overdose, Zoolander 2, Ab Fab The Movie keeps throwing hordes of celebrities at you in an attempt to mask the script’s complete lack of comedic class, but it never works, and makes for an even more dull and underwhelming watch.

Overall, I thought that this was a really disappointing film. With so much talent coming from the original series, this film is perfect evidence of how a sitcom doesn’t work stretched to 90 minutes, thanks to its dull, unoriginal screenplay, poor comedy, and excess of celebrity cameos."

If you're a fan of the movie you'll appreciate that most things are exactly the same: the family is back, their habits haven't changed and the humor ranges from clever to broad to absurd. There are dozens of cameos, but if you're not up on English pop culture many may go unappreciated. The costumes are wonderfully over the top. Other than a parade of celebs, nothing about the big screen version is stepped up…just more semi-outrageous antics from the women who made it fun to be degenerate."

Being a B movie, it is not that bad. It is eligible for some minor exceptions and if you consider that while watching it, then it does not disappoint much. Yes, there are many similar films like this, but what makes it somewhat special is that it is quite freely explored its contents without stressing out on detailing everything. I meant it was a simple road adventure film and you would feel it very familiar yet you will realise that it is not worth criticing it.

The actors were decent, but expected much better. Directed by a newcomer who had written many screenplays similar this theme. Like I said it was quite predictable, at a time decently enjoyable with a few laughs now and then, especially that Mexican police station scene was hilarious. You might get a million reasons to dislike it, but you achieve nothing from it. According to me it was surely a decent watch, hence not a must see, but if you do, then don't take it seriously, try to have fun within its limits.

I am not saying the film was terrible, but the timing was bad. There are loads of great sci-fi films were made recently and still coming out. So to compete with them, they have to go through alteration, even if they loose the origins of their film's theme concept. This story is same as many similar themed flicks. For me, it looked like a mini Superman film, but made for kids.

The best thing about it was, keeping everything simple. And then the pace, which actually somewhat saved the film. I hooked to it from the beginning till the conclusion, but familiarity is what killed my interest and entertainment. The characters were okay, not developed well enough. But keeping young audience in mind, it does good. Because going deep is unnecessary stretch.

The story of a high school boy who transferred back to a small town where has born. As he begins to hear a lot about his father from the local people, he becomes motivated to know more about him. But one day when something goes wrong, the next day he wakes up with great power. Not knowing how to handle it, he befriends with an unusual creature and together they fight those who are after them.

Initially I thought it was related to 'Real Steel', but realised only while watching it it is completely different. From the director of 'Sorority Row', I think he did nothing wrong. Those who watch less films would enjoy it better. Visually okay, with all those graphics. Since it is PG13, I would say the target audience is the little ones. So from their perspective, it is acceptable. But I warn the grownups, stay away, or be like them while watching it, in order to get entertained.

I enjoyed watching it in parts, but frankly I am disappointed for this potential theme was misused for ineffectual narration.

Looks like inspired by 'Serial Mom'. When a little, strange but a happy family who are living by the storybook of their own was threatened by the dark side of the life, they are ready to jump into the hell to save it. They have ignited it, but the only concern is how to end it all for good.

Other than IMDb where it stands average, the movie was slammed very badly by the critics and moviegoers. I have seen even worse than this one. So to me it is an average except the end, otherwise below average. Yes, the conclusion was terrible, seems like they don't want a continuation. I mean they wanted to end it all here itself. It is a watchable, but simply not the best one.

Apart from the performances of a couple of actors I was entertained more often then not.

It was fine. Entertaining even. The cast is solid and while the premiss gets lost in the slippery plot, it sticks to their mythos and features some perfectly fine twists as to what is going on. The big reveal was what brought the movie down for me personally, but I thought that it fit well with the narrative that they had designed for the back story. I will say though that they also borrowed heavily from the TV series ""Lost."" Right down to the casting of someone who I thought for a second was a digitally de-aged Matthew Fox at the first shot he was in. All in all if you like lite-horror and can handle a slight grade above a B movie then this should be an okay watch. Fun even with the scenes with Dax and Jimmy.

This one’s about a headhunter whose life revolves around closing deals in survival-of-the-fittest boiler room. He battles his top rival for control of the company, but then his oldest child falls seriously ill.
Also starring, Gretchen Mol as the loving but ever-suffering wife, Willem Dafoe as the ruthless boss, Alison Brie as the rival and Alfred Molina as the token solid supporting male character.
First and foremost, „A Family Man“ is a genre movie, which means it’s produced and put together of cliches in hope of finding a suitable mainstream audience.
The approach is pretty solid one, using several drama subgenres in order to appeal to wider circle of cinema-goers, including sick child story, a middle class American success story, finding yourself again story and some „Wall Street“ type high-octane competence porn.
The execution is actually pretty solid too. The able cast are doing their darndest best to act through all the material, and there’s a lot of it.
108 minute movie may feel quite a bit longer, at least for those who have seen way too many movies to take all these cliches and workmanlike storytelling seriously.
On the other hand, those who still watch movies as just a nice way of passing time, or aren’t tired of bland dramas made of middle-class dreams and aspirations, can definitely find some entertainment here.
They don’t even have to think how to feel because the movie manipulates you in all the right directions at the right time.
I am taking a wild guess that ""A Family Man"" is most suitable for girlish audience, but it will also surely feel in the right place when it’s 2 am and you’re desperately trying to find something new to watch with Butler starring in it.
He’s a doing a fine job too, the whole result relies on his manly charm and grunting.
All in all, there’s nothing wrong with „A Family Man“. It’s just there’s nothing terribly exciting either, with the creative bar set relatively low and all.
I hope I didn’t sound too ironic here or something, I quite liked the movie for what it is."

The directors style in cinematography was just the usual stuff, nothing new. Despite the two protagonists the rest of the characters writing was painfully average, and the script was cliche. The visual looked very weird in some instances when it was CGI, because of the poor way it was generated.

The movie is about the crudity, everything else second. While this does lead to a rather cheap feeling experience, it's something that probably works in Dirty Grandpa's favor. It's evident that the people behind this aren't exactly the deepest of people. **** jokes are right up their alley, and hey, they're good at making them. Mostly. While it's not always the funniest or even the most original film out there in the ever-widening sea of R-rated comedies, there are some laughs to be had. Plus, all of the actors were totally on board with the project. There are some surprisingly good performances here. The supporting cast is also pretty great. Particularly Jason Mantzoukas, who regularly brings some of the biggest laughs. Everyone onscreen is so good you almost want to see them in something with more brains behind it. For a movie this vulgar, raunchy, immature, inappropriate, and sex-obsessed, I can't think of a score any more fitting of it than a 6.9/10."

On the other, it's not nearly funny enough by half and so ridiculously homophobic, sexist, etc that it isn't challenging stereotypes it's just exploiting them for personal gain. And what little gain it is. So much of this feels so clearly ad-libbed that it's basically a parody of an Apatow movie - call it Raunch Movie.

The actors's performances, despite being all very renown actors was not as great as expected, in fact the emotions and jokes where pretty dull as well. It's just another ordinary average performance because of the script writing and movie directing style affected their roles. I would say a lousy writing and script is what leads to these great actors not performing  well. The was there but sadly it was a disaster as it was to serious in that aspect and sarcastic and hard to get sometimes. The sounds where great but the complete lack of music in certain scenes did not help the movie overall. It was a rushed plot-less movie which would have done a lot better if it where a TV short, because the plot was lacking a lot of content to the base. Overall this is a flawed movie down to the core and it is very disappointing even despite having some elements as entertainment and fun handled well.

764,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/just-getting-started/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,TheQuietGamer,"Jun 1, 2018",5,"A Christmas comedy for those of retirement age. As odd as it's holiday setting is, it does a decent job of showing those who are entering the final chapter of their lives having some fun. The plot centers around the rivalry between Morgan Freeman and Tommy Lee Jones and the former's mysterious past that eventually leads to them becoming friends. The humor is rather uneven and the pacing is quite slow. The whole thing is really just a series of competitions between the two leads broken up by awkward bits of unsuccessful flirting with Rene Russo's character before the more action-oriented (and absurd) final act.


The duo's battle for popularity and female attention is largely carried by Freeman. It's nice to see the actor being able to cut loose like this. Even in other movies like Last Vegas where the main idea is to watch everyone cut up, Freeman has always played one of the more restrained and mature characters onscreen. Here he's just a total playboy. Jones is decent as the straight man. His over-serious nature and constant grim stare make his one-liners more amusing than they otherwise would have been. A shame these two great and respectable leads weren't given better material.


For those just entering or already partaking in their later years, Just Getting Started will likely prove to be a good time. It's a middle-of-the-road comedy that wants to show that getting old doesn't necessarily mean that the good times are at an end. As the movie says, ""Happiness is not a condition. It's a choice."" Still, the choice might be somewhat out of people's hands when it comes to watching this one. Particularly in the case of more youthful viewers. The material is quite weak and no amount of pandering to a specific audience can cover it up. Plus there's how it comes off as more of a TV movie than something that made it's way into theaters. Overall, there is an audience for this film. Unfortunately I can't count myself among them, but maybe those who have gotten on up in the years can."

First, the various stories seem unrelated with only minor interactions. The transitions are abrupt, ending one story and then moving onto the next. While the plot ties them all together in the end, waiting for it takes some effort.

Second, all of the stories are centered around tragedy and I just stopped caring at some point.

Third, with the amount of time spent on the ""unreliable narrator"" device in the beginning, I expected (or even hoped for) it to play a significant role in the movie, but it doesn't. Sure, there is a little twist in the end that ties it all together, but it is ineffective and unimportant.

Finally, the resolution at the end that ties everything together was a disappointment."

I think the film gets better with time. The film seems to be saying without love, there is nothing, though if one persists in their life, they will find everlasting love; Life Itself makes love the ever connecting fabric between the dead and the living.

I always like to remember as a part of the audience I am agreeing to view the content as-is in comparison to its full potential (which helps fulfill my critiquing) and if I want to view different forms of content then I should create or seek them. The film as-is is decent though leaves me as an audience member with the assignment of listening to Bob Dylan's return project to potentially fully grasp the essence of the film (if Bob Dylan really contributes to it as much as the film makes it seem). Life Itself is not meant to be a serious film (you have to experience the narrating for yourself) though deals with serious situations. 

The film shows that dialogue really affects actors and must be written well for effective scenes in film. Life Itself is showing life without expectations and relays life as uncontrollable in a great mysteriousness. I mean, yeah… death is our only guarantee (as far as I think anyone knows so far, that's all anyone knows of life that really isn't life, it's post life?).

Cinematically, the plot was cliched and offensive and the production aspects were boring, but the film had an excuse. This film was technically directed by David O.

It was in the pre-production for over a decade, before reshuffle and recasting happened with the existing one. It was supposed to be an Indo-Aussie joint production, but later the Belgium production company joined the project. After the several hurdles it managed to get completed. It was an Anglo-Indian historical romance-drama, during the British raj in India about betrayal, coup, revenge and a journey movie. Also simultaneously set in the modern world focusing an archaeological couple who discovers a lost ancient Indian jewel in a shipwreck. From there the story gets a perfect beginning, later moves back to India.

I don't understand what's with the Chinese music where the actual story take place in the 18th century India. It was so good and blends well, but that does define India or Indian culture while narrating its story. If you are not familiar with both Chinese and Indian musics, then it's not an issue at all. But that does not it, the names are Hindu and Indian soldiers with the Persian costumes, swords and other gadgets.

How the name 'Dragon's Throat' came to Indian geographical area and surname for the Indian characters in a wrong princely state. Like that, many stuffs make no sense, especially if you are from that part of the Earth. I think the research was very poor for making this movie. They should have hired an Indian musician and costume designer with an historian.

""Love has many faces,
and one of them is jealousy.""

The quality was top notch, the cast and their performances were excellent. But I could not stand for Bipasha Basu's facial expressions. She was always been in a sad face look, so depressing. That is the way her character was developed, so nothing wrong in her display. It was her international debut flick as well, and the launch was so disappointing. Because the story was very weak, maybe very silly. I have never seen the narration set in the ancient India other than in the Indian films. Quite amazing locations, and convinced with the visuals that how the 1700s' subcontinent would have looked like.

The major problem with this flick is that people can't get ending. How the time barrier was broken to pass through another timeline was never explained. The Hindu priest/saint/sadhu who blabbers about the space and time was a ridiculous than intellectual briefing. So this film owes lots of explanation to the viewers than entertaining them. I want to favour it, but I also want to be honest. The film was not like I was hoping for, very excited for the merge of historical subject with sci-fi, but did not stand tall. Thankfully, either it was not a bad movie of the year, I've seen even worse that I felt not to review. I won't recommend it, but there's a slim chance that you might like it, so choose it carefully.

This is why you're seeing reviews run hot and cold. The basic premise is a good, scifi-mind-transference one, but a short 100-min film demands unacceptable compromises. This needs A LOT of run room to properly play out, so it needed to be an 8 to 13 episode streaming series. Shoehorning this story into 100-mins results in ridiculous timelines and implausibilities. And Keanu's infamous wooden acting doesn't help to sell this either. Thank god for Middleditch's character that attempted to call into question so much of the ridiculosity going on. (Can't wait for the next season of him in Silicon Valley.)

With iffy effects, mediocre acting from all involved (including Keanu Reeves unfortunately), unintentionally humorous scenes, and countless sci-fi tropes and cliches thrown into one jumbled mess of a film, it's definitely easily forgettable and disposable.

I really wonder how this was made for a whopping 30m budget and turned out so laughably mediocre especially with Keanu Reeves involved. It truly plays out like a VOD type 3m budget film with some awful acting, messy plotting, dull dialogue, and worst of all abhorrent mid 90s like CGI. While the intro abruptly intrigues somewhat with an ambitious enough sequence of events, it unravels into ridiculous yet watchable territory quickly. Most of the film drags on until an insane conclusion which at least swings for the fence with some exciting moments albeit nonsensical. Overall it's a very forgettable film that doesn't deliver much ultimately, that happens to have Keanu in it. If you're a fan of Keanu, it's worth watching but don't expect much."

This turns out to be super convenient as the scientist loses his wife and kids in a car crash. Grief-stricken, he clones their bodies and transfers their consciousnesses (as one does). What results is a surprisingly amateurish effort considering the lead.

The dialogue is pretty weak. People do things that don't feel natural. Weirdly enough, the movie explains certain things pretty thoroughly and interestingly, such as the whole lazarus/rebirth process, while other plot points are just revealed abruptly and sloppily.

The acting doesn't help things either. Keanu is on autopilot here. The guy who plays his boss is hit-and-miss. But it's Alice Eve (She's Out of my League; Star Trek into Darkness) who has the worst performance. She acts like an animatronic. (And yes this is even before the cloning. It isn't a something-went-wrong-type situation.) She has two facial expressions: slightly happy and slightly worried. On the plus side, Silicon Valley's Ben Middleditch is the only one who manages to make all the dialogue work. My hat off to him.

It's sad that this movie was botched so badly because the actual general story could have worked. The concepts they explore here are fun and fascinating. A lot of thought did go into how they brought the family back.

To it's credit, the film does look really good. It has excellent color use and picturesque filming locations.

Overall, this is a bad film, but I wouldn't say it was downright painful. I didn't leave regretting having watched it. If you like making fun of bad movies, then you might want to check this out. Otherwise, I can't recommend this."

The low-rent camerawork and costuming don't help. A lot of scenes looks like a bunch of Eurotrash rejects from The Matrix stepped into a student film. At one point the evil villain goes over his master plan. He literally just explains how retirement plans work, and then the Matrix rejects say ""please explain"". I think most 18-year-olds with a decent job can already follow the plot kid, but the director really thinks he sounds like a genius. It's like in a low-rent horror movie when a ""scientist"" tries to sound smart by reading a page from a gradeschool science book.

Director Jonas Akerlund is famous for his music videos which I've personally never thought were very well-made. They're usually just very weird, which works for music. But they weren't very technically well-shot. In a film, all his flaws are amplified.

It's sad because Mads Mikkelsen is amazing. Fans of his later performance in Hannibal already know how amazing Mads is as the sort of quiet intimidation that makes for a perfect assassin. He really acts the pants off his role, even while the Eurotrash around him stumble over lines and bad makeup and worse accents.

People will say ""just turn off your brain"". An enjoyable movie shouldn't have to involve absolutely insulting drivel. Here's a quick example. The bad guy needs exactly $29 million or whatever. So he decides to enact a giant plan to steal - wait for it - exactly $29 million. Except to do this, he's going to have to hire an absurd number of top-notch hitmen from around the world. That's going to cost, what, $29 million? So this job - at best - is going to break even? Come on. It isn't hard to write yourself out of this hole either - just make the payoff something absurd like a billion dollars. Why not?

Sigh. So this is a really stupid movie with annoying direction. Only watch it if you want to see Mads Mikkelsen kick some ass, and don't be afraid to fast forward the dumb Eurotrash nonsense between the action scenes. You won't miss anything."

However, I'm often left perplexed by Fred Durst's lyrics. Sometimes there's a clear message there and others all I can gather is that it's just a bunch word vomit where confusion seems to be the only rational reaction. You can probably guess which type The Fanatic more closely resembles...

In this clash between action movie star and obsessed fan it's never clear who you're supposed to be rooting for. ""Moose"" is a clearly autistic man who just doesn't know any better, but that doesn't make him any less dangerous. ""Hunter Dunbar"" is world-class jerk who definitely could handled the situation better, but it's hard to fault him for getting aggressive when faced with a stalker that crossed the line. Perhaps we're not supposed to sympathize with either of them in the end. Which would have been acceptable had there been some kind of meaning to all of this, but alas there doesn't appear to be any. So that violent conclusion just ends up leaving a bad taste in your mouth.

The humor it tries to mine from Moose's childlike behavior feels out of place and may not sit well with some as it comes at the expense of the mentally ill, but I wouldn't straight garbage or anything like that. It's just that without anything to say for itself the film's most notable qualities end up being John Travolta's all in, yet strangely terrible performance and the fact that it's entirely the brainchild of Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst. Both of which are certainly interesting, but not enough to make the movie worth watching given the considerable lack of substance.

796,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-ridiculous-6/user-reviews/?filter=Mixed%20Reviews,IAmTech,"Jun 18, 2016",5,"Yes that's right, I've seen the fabled one time controversial Adam Sandler movie, all the way through! who wants to touch me? (yes I also realise I just totally dated my own review with this dated gag reference, had to be done). So **** a dumb western filled with blatant stereotypes, corny routines, obvious gags and it treats women as nothing more than sexual objects, but in all honesty what did you expect? Firstly its an Adam Sandler movie, and secondly, it has 'ridiculous' in the bloody title! its literately saying to you, this movie is gonna be daft as ****, you have been warned. So why all the fuss I don't know.

Plot wise its your typical western fare about revenge ****, more revenge. Tommy Stockburn (Sandler) has been raised by native Americans (or red Indians to be politically incorrect) because way back as a child his mother was shot dead by a mysterious stranger. His father Frank (Nick Nolte) was an infamous bank robber and just happens to come by Tommy's village to tell him he's his father because plot convenience. Frank speaks of 50K he's buried away and intends to share with Tommy, but before you can say rootin-tootin outlaws, some outlaws turn up that used to be in a gang with Frank and claim the money. Frank lies about the moneys whereabouts as the gang take him hostage to go find it, this gives Tommy time to find the loot in its real location. Alas Tommy is unable to find the loot so he must come up with another way to raise 50K to pay the outlaws and save his dad. The clock is ticking before the outlaws realise that Frank was lying about the moneys location.

Now the main lure here must be the stereotypical ridiculous six characters that are all hilariously related to each other, no really its **** its not. Sandler is obviously the leader of the gang, the low gravely Eastwood voiced, ice cool loner, raised by native Americans and is super hot with knives. Terry Crews is Chico, a black piano player who hasn't ever admitted to anyone he's actually, possibly, slightly black, and of course despite the fact he's ****'s actually a real softie. Jorge Garcia plays Herm, a role that probably would have gone to John Belushi or John Candy if they were alive. A big fat slobby, dirty, feral type bloke who can't speak English but everyone understands him anyway. Taylor Lautner embarrasses himself immensely here as the gangs redneck simpleton complete with braces and buckteeth. Luke Wilson plays the dandy type, good looking, athletic, well dressed, but a miserable failure with his last occupation as a bodyguard for Abe Lincoln. Lastly good old Rob Schneider plays the greasy dirty Mexican Ramon who owns a donkey with super powered diarrhea. So there you have a complete array of stereotypes, the white man raised by Indians, the token black guy, the fat slob, the doofus, the dandy and the dirty Mexican. Oh and Nolte, can't understand a bloody word he's saying, not one.

Now whilst many might be expecting the biggest load of horse **** this side of the Rio Grande, in all fairness, its not that **** places. The gang sets out to pinch 50K from various people and places that they consider to be bad or immoral, so they don't feel bad about stealing basically. As you might expect what you get is pretty predictable stuff with some pretty daft action. They rob a bank utilising Ramon's diarrhea filled donkey as a diversion, yes this means the donkey **** all over someone. They steal a huge gold nugget from a casino owned by Smiley Harris (Harvey Keitel), this involved much silly hijinks from the whole gang such as Chico and his piano playing and Tommy with his knife skills. They also steal a huge sum of cash from Ezekiel Grant (Jon Lovitz), Mark Twain (Vanilla Ice) and General Custer (David Spade) in a poker game which involves the whole gang. Yes I did just mention Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain, yes it was unbelievably insane casting, yes I admit I quite liked it yet I do not know why, yes I am ashamed of myself.

Another rather quirky scene involved John Turturro as Abner Doubleday, the man who apparently came up with the all American national past time of rounde...errr baseball. I don't know the history behind this actual person, nor do I know the rules of baseball inside out, however I do have a basic knowledge of the game, not that that's necessary to enjoy this scene though...I digress. Anywho, this scene is actually quite amusing as Turturro literately makes up the rules of baseball as he goes along, but only because he's trying to not lose at his own creation. It sounds childish but the fact that Doubleday is useless at his own sport creation, whilst everyone else is getting the hang of it, was actually reasonably funny, mainly because of Turturro's performance.

This movie is pretty much like any throwaway silly comedy I've ever seen through my life, it has its moments, it does make you smile at times, and to that **** done its job essentially (much like the gloriously stu"

I think the questions to ask us are:
- Is it necessary to pay a ticket to observe someone else's life, like on a social network?
- Does the time spent yield anything in return?
I might understand the concept, but for my taste, entirely unnecessary, leaving the feeling, minute by minute, of a constant loss of time.

If anything about good and evil, right or wrong, morality in general is touched upon, it is strictly restrained to moral relativism, where it's always ""up to the viewer"" to form their own feelings, the filmmaker tries not to offer the slightest clue about his or her stance on the issues. Pretty much every last ""critically acclaimed"" TV show these days falls under this category, and a plethora of movies, Manchester by the Sea being the most recent example of the ones I have seen, though it's really not about one or two examples.

The issue I have with this ""non judgmental"" trend is that I firmly believe art, truly great art, should in some shape or form benefit society, not simply present it ""as is."" When society celebrates stories of moral relativism, it adopts moral relativism. Things that were, and for good reason, seen as clearly wrong, suddenly become ""complex,"" up for personal interpretation, depending on ""circumstance."" And if challenged, the excuse is always ""oh I'm not endorsing this, I'm just portraying real life without judging. This is what people do.""

But when art abandons teaching moral messages, that contributes to society becoming morally anchorless and losing its scope of what's right or wrong. No, this definitely is not an argument about ""violent movies influence violence in real life"" or anything of the sort - it's not about what is portrayed, but how it is portrayed. And morality seems to have been sacrificed by many filmmakers on the altar of realism, with both public and critical acclaim embracing this with both arms."

My concern has grown since going to watch it. I'm glad the masses found it enjoyable. I, unfortunately, find myself to be one of few (at least vocal) cinemagoers who did not like the film. Leaving the cinema, I was offended. I felt gypped, cheated, mislead, though, happy to see the back of it. To evoke the saying ""throw me a bone"", this movie showed me its bones, one by one, placed them clumsily into its various pockets and tripped into the sea. I waited for this movie to give me anything, something I could leave with, something to shock me, something I haven't seen before. It gave me the latter, perhaps the most tedious, plodding, most unenjoyable cinema experience in recent memory.  I found myself counting the seconds between each line of dialogue delivered. It was comical. I was grasping for threads to follow, themes of substance, anything, I was starving. Maybe that was the point, a realist approach, showing it as it were, I had surmised. I tossed and turned in this manner until I had no longer cared as to construe purpose in the film. Resorting to taking in the pretty pictures, I landed at the conclusion that this was what the film was, and just that. Just as I relaxed uncomfortably, a thought of Barry Lyndon came to my head. Perhaps this film excels at nothing.

As I do with any art related enterprise, I give props to the filmmakers for making art, participating in the craft, and for throwing in their two cents. Offended as I was by the lack of substance within the picture, they provided me with something to get passionate about, even if that may be the distaste for the picture itself. I see this picture called ""The perfect film"", to that I must conclude this is your first time, there's much more in store for you."

And I simply couldn't believe that any mother would react so lightly to learning that her husband intended to petition for full child custody.

What did she see in Blanchett's character that was so appealing? What did Blanchett see in her? Until their later scene of passion, I just never felt any chemistry between them.

There is a fixation on a white stick inside the English planes on the left hand side which gets multiple close in shots but it's never made clear what this stick does or why it is given so much prominence. In general I was somewhat mystified by how few of anything, except English soldiers, were shown in the film.

Totally the opposite of Saving private Ryan, Hacksaw ridge etc.
Christopher Nolan wanted a suspense film, and not a war film as such, and yet this is a failure too, as I had no empathy with any of the characters weather they lived or died. Hans Zimmer is a great music composer, however the music  was supposed to add some intensity and suspense to the film and yet I just found it annoying as it was constant throughout.

871,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/45-years/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,GreatMartin,"Jan 29, 2016",1,"Where do I start? There is nothing wrong with Charlotte Rampling's performance but certainly not worth an Oscar nomination over either Lily Tomlin in ""Grandma"" or Charlize Theron in ""Mad Max"" just to name possible other candidates. Do I say that the film is 'much ado about nothing' and would have been served better being a one hour TV movie on Lifetime or Netflex?

""45 Years"" seems just that long in spite of the running time being only 95 minutes but it is padded with many scenes of Rampling, sometimes with a dog, sometimes not, walking on the admitted beautiful shots of Norfolk landscapes where the story takes place or one extended scene of her playing the piano.

The conflict, that took place before they met, seemingly upends all that they have had is really a flimsy reason for what takes place. She was a teacher, he a factory manager and they have had a 45 year loving, comfortable, childless marriage with both being retired now, she still very active and he slowing down to illness.Without giving anything away it seems very far fetched that things always available are now seen and read for the first time.

Watching the performances of Charlotte Rampling and Tim Courtenay, who have been stars for over 50 years, are always a joy to watch and even though their silences can say a lot here they really aren't given substantial material to work with.  There is a scene between the two having sex that is very funny and could be real to life but it isn't enough.

""45 Years"" is one of the very few films that I would recommend seeing on the small screen instead of a theatre screen."

If the awful pacing wasn't bad enough, the plotting--if you could call it that--was even worse.  This film was based on a short story and it showed--not enough plot there for a feature film.  And finally, the conflict between the two characters was left completely unresolved.  I guess that's artsy, but if you ask me, it's lazy storytelling, the issues were not explored so it's not surprising they were not resolved.  Was the acting fantastic?

It has no social importance or, more seriously, redemption. It is a movie about white men killing white men. There are no women, no blacks, no other ethnicities but Italians (even the “Irishman” is played by an Italian). Movies like this have littered the film landscape for 38 years since 1972’s The Godfather (which did the same thing but so much better, mainly because the genre was new). On a broader brush I say: Scorsese and Tarantino and the ilk should no longer have the power to make their pointless glorification of murder stories. It is long past time to let new voices with new visions into the boys club of directing and producing movies. I am a movie lover fed up with decades of stories about murderers. Make it stop.

Since statistics show that ""arranged marriages"" last longer than ""love marriages"", this nineteenth-century and Victorian invention of ours would deserve at least a minimum of deepening. The suggested hypothesis is that interpersonal affective relationships can't not fail because, before that, there would be an unresolved **** conflict, the ""Spaltung"" a.k.a. inner splitting. Therefore a mumblecore that merely describes the phenomenology of such failure as already too many previous film is just useful to mitigate the frustration of those who identify with the couple of protagonists."

Well, how about for the first time ever, metacritic has let me down. Can I ask them for a refund? Lol! For those of you who are interested in my opinion, I just found the movie boring. It's basically snapshots **** life and they just weren't that interesting or compelling. I found myself checking the time, shifting in my seat, eating too much popcorn to try and stave off the boredom. It just wasn't for me.

Christine (oh squeeze me, ""Lady Bird""), was everything her mother said she was. Selfish, ungrateful, argumentative and a bit of a user. As the lead character, she wasn't a very nice person. Her mother was mean, a bully, controlling and miserable. Welcome to the 2 lead characters! On the plus side, the supporting characters were mostly delightful! Christine's best friend Jules was so lovely, I want her for my best friend. The father was just a gorgeous, supportive person and even her belligerent brother and his strange girlfriend were more interesting and more open to criticism than ""Lady Bird"" herself. If this is autobiographical in any way, I don't think Greta Gerwig was a very nice teenager! (That's right, I said it, come at me!!!)  In short, I found the movie stale. Nothing new or interesting here. How the hell it got a 94 is still beyond me. That's a bloody high score!!! At least the user score has it lower down the totem pole, with Phantom Thread, The Greatest Showman and Paddington 2 rating higher. I think I'll have to pay more attention to the userscore and less to the metascore in the future. Maybe, if it had a score of 60/70, I wouldn't be so scathing but I feel royally ripped off and I'm never gonna get those 90 mins back.

The leader of that pack was Tree of Life, which was laughably bad.  We go to movies virtually every week, and we always check Metacritic ratings which provide guidance, but not strong enough to be a sole determinant of our interest.  These kinds of movies are, in my view, actually  produced for critics, perhaps to win one of those esoteric Cannes-type festival awards, irrespective of commercial success.  This movie was 165 minutes L  O  N  G and could have been half as long. The final scene was so very typical, dwelling on Ines still and emotionless face for what seemed like a minute. There were several shots like that.  And the movie pinballed all over the place and was difficult to follow. It was mostly in Germany, switching sort of seamlessly to French, English and Romanian, making it even more difficult to follow.  We sort of get the message, having worked in corporations and as a consultant. And we've all seen or been part of dysfunctional relationships between adult children and their parents.  Nothing particular was illuminated here. Perhaps the reason I gave this a 2 was Metacritic's professional critics averaged 93, which is ludicrous.  We have seen movies in the 50s that were far more entertaining."

What was the last funny German comedy you saw? What was the last 3 hour funny comedy you saw?

At the Gateway Theatre in Fort Lauderdale they have a section where audience members can post cards with what they thought of the movie they just saw and I put “Awful—even worse than “Neruda”—see my review of Tuesday February 7th.

In a running time of 2 hours and 45 minutes I found a total of 6 to7 minutes that got me to smile and in those 6 to 7 minutes, maybe 2 minutes, which were old fashioned slapstick making it seem like a comedy.

The film is primarily a daughter, Ines, played by Sandra Huller, and father, Winifred alias Toni, played by Peter Simonischek, story. The father is a child who never grew up and the daughter a workaholic always wheeling and dealing, a lot on the phone, and having to put up with the sexism of the work place.

Winifred puts on a wild wig and uses false teeth to bring some fun into his daughter’s life whether it is at the workplace where she seems to play along in order to avoid embarrassment or in what little private life she has. The film takes that 2 hour and 45 minutes to show the results.

There are a couple of full frontal/rear male/female scenes with one really generating a good laugh but if you think watching a guy **** on a petit-four or another one sitting on whoopee cushion is funny than maybe this movie is for you.

“Toni Erdmann” does have a couple of touching scenes but what film dealing with a father and daughter at odds with each other doesn’t?

It is only the 7th week into the new year and I already have 2 of the worst films on my yearly list."

But of course, how could any of this be known when it all took place so very long ago and, so little survives or had been recorded about the famous Bard. Writer Ben Elton has donned both his creative hats for this concoction – that of total fictional fabrication and ‘what we think to know’ presumptions. Director/actor Kenneth Branagh while wanting to accurately transcribe the times may have forgotten that it’s also important to entertain his audience and allow them to enjoy the visual treats of sets, costumes, and creating a mood via creative lighting. His sets are so gloomily lit there’s a tenancy to lull the viewer to sleep. A particularly slow pace could even leave some reaching for the 2 x times remote.  This need not have been - broad subjects such as this, set in dark times, under other great lighting/cameramen have allowed us to be transported back to bygone candle/gaslight days by using deep blacks and well-lit subjects that allowed viewers to feel the era and enjoy the rich moods simultaneously. For an artificial interpretation of reality, a thinking audience will forgive any production that considers their visual appreciation over sombre moods.

Modern liberties seem to have been catered for by suggesting that Will’s Sonnets may have been written for another bloke – in this case, the Earle of Southampton. Not sure where Elton came up with this suggestion as there doesn’t appear all that much documentation to build on that assumption.  We learn that Mr Shakespeare did not attend University, somewhat proving that a University degree can’t always account for intelligence, and that his wife Anne was illiterate. There are other family intrigues to offer personal interest but what promised to be an enlightening experience comes across as a tad too heavy-handed and at times inaccessible.

It dived away from its original movie The Shining and its unique Hotel experience and they turned it into a superhero movie with such dull characters and a stupid story. The movie was too long and so damn boring, the only part where i enjoyed it was in the last chapter where it finally felt a bit like The Shining and the flashbacks were good as well.

Don't watch this movie thinking it will be anywhere similar to The Shining or to its story it's far from it.

Everything from the color correction, the acting, the editing, the laughable CGI, to the set design looked like a cheap television show. The characters were hilariously underwritten and poorly developed. Lets take a look at the main characters of Doctor Sleep. First we have hipster witch **** who was the most cliché and uninspired villain Hollywood has seen in a long while. Her costume design alone was enough to send shivers down my spine. Next we have teenage supergirl who was completely lifeless, poorly acted, and was a constant reminder that this movie was very likely intended for a much younger audience. Then we have a generic alcoholic version of Renton from Trainspotting who really did a great job playing an addict. (Just kidding go watch **** Trainspotting) What really busted my nut was the recurring homages to Kubrick which served as constant reminders of how good The Shining is and how bad this movie is. I laughed out loud when I saw the continued attempts to recreate iconic shots from The Shining as if it would trick the audience into believing the two films were even close to being on the same level. I know it’s most likely not fair to compare this film to one of the greatest horror movies of all time but it’s incredibly difficult not to when you see the repeated attempts to recreate what Kubrick envisioned. How can the audience be expected not to compare these two films when the only moments of genuine cinematic style in Doctor Sleep are blatant recreations of scenes from The Shining. Not one moment of this movie was interesting, thrilling, unique, or necessary."

Other than that, Sing is a rushed movie on so many aspects.  One being that the whole story changes because of something so stupid and unrealistic (an eyeball falling out of a lizards head), they should have put more thought into that. Another being that they use animals instead of humans, and they don't even act like Animals.  Disney's ""Zootopia"" at least follows the basis that they are still animals, even though they are basically human, they still have animal traits that have a roll on the story of Zootopia, Sing falls short in that.  The characters really feel bland and not interesting and hard to love.  Sing is one movie that is very forgettable and Illumination better pick up their act soon or just stick to Despicable Me, and even that they can't do.

Thus every character in this film comes off as one dimensional and boring. with one exception, Johnny  the Gorilla. The only other good part about this movie is the ending scene which is when, shock of all shock, the characters actually preform full musical numbers. you see in the majority of the film we don't get full musical numbers just pits of the characters singing.

The production itself is mainly dark, which is understandable in a film like this and the director Craig William Macneill handles both the frontal nudity and the mother getting the ’40 wacks and her father 41’ discreetly up to a point. By the way, if the wacks are a spoiler you are too young to see this movie.

Chloe Sevigny, as Lizzie, is okay but she has yet to really impress me. Kristen Stewart, as the maid Bridget, adds another intriguing acting job in an independent film as she has done since playing Bella Swan in The Twilight Saga.

The cast including Jamey Sheridan as the father, Fiona Shaw as his wife, Kim **** as Lizzie’s sister Emma and Dennis O’Hare as an uncle all deliver the goods.

Run All Night

And we meet again. The writer Brad Ingelsby fascinates me. His writing procedure, his character and the way they travel in his plot tracks is equally intriguing. They take detours, they take uncalled stops, they bump into randomness and they also ask us to stop this everlasting train. And I know I usually give credit, at first. to the director who in this case is Jaume Collet-Serra. I just wanted to swoon over Brad's filmography and how it has caught my eye over the years. Not that I have anything new to add to those already said and observed things. This project, the stereotypical action thriller and it is extremely typical in its genre, has something else that I'd loved and exhaled over. It is its irrelevantly fast edited scenarios.

And not some physical action sequence but even a conversation is crisply edited out. No. Not crisply, but wrongly. Multiple times we can see the dialogues lapped over physical sequences to pace up the film in a briskly adventurous night. What it instead results into is a disappointing questionable set of scenarios that doesn't respect anything. Neither the action nor the characters nor the actors and what they are diving or dying or performing for is accounted into a disrespectful character.

Character, I say, for it repeatedly pops up on screen and also has his own arc in the sense that it gets less and less visible and annoying. Run All Night seems, is simply terribly edited. It cuts to another frame within a blink or like a blink. It feels unintentional, wrong and doesn't quite add up. There is a disturbance between conversation. This violence is much louder than any other explosives and bangs. And on the other hand, the final act is incredibly slow and settling which in its own way makes up for that uncalled editing that jumps back and forth."

Granted, the basic plotline is not too bad: Edie and Patsy are old and slowly losing their fabulous lifestyle they used to enjoy. There is quite a few important issues here: ageing, careers, sexism, materialism, etc. However, that is where the ingenuity ends. The execution of the film is utterly ridiculous. While the show used to be very sarcastic and basically make fun of people like Edie and Patsy, now that aspect of the story is lost. Their characters are shallow. There was no *real* character development from when the show ended in the 90's up until this moment - something that was supposed to happen.
Otherwise, the acting is a bit too slapsticky from everyone, as well as the entire production just seemed somehow as fake as the CGI background behind Kate Moss.

Gloria Bing could have lost Kate Moss as a client and Eddy and Gloria could have had a battle of butt kissing that would have been hilarious. On the plane, they could have thought they had first class tickets, sat down in FC, be treated llike royalty until it is discovered they are on the wrong plane and are forced to fly a low cost carrier and sit with whinny kids, a person with BO, etc. They could have employed their Little Britain friends to do the Come Fly With Me characters.There should have been a confrontation between Safron and Patsy. The police chasing Patsy and Eddy should have been drawn out and comical. Leaving Safron's daughter at the hotel to work as a maid should have been as meaningful as when Patsy sold Saffy in Morocco. They should have been detained at the airport for Patsy's suspicious items and had her inspected to where she enjoys it. A bomb threat at the airport or a fire alarm provides their escape or something from the airport. The one Patsy was going to marry should have been drawn out. Patsy gets to go to bed with him and dies in the middle of love making or something, spoiling their plans. She steals what she can from the house and makes a get away. When she marries the richest woman, she has to put a strap-on and doesn't know how to use. A comical scene could happen when she uses other items - a banana, a shoe, something funny.

The main character Max McGrath (Ben Winchell) is completely boring, poorly acted, and has no depth and the rest of the characters have no depth either. Max's crush/girlfriend, Sophia Martinez (Ana Villafañe) didn't really have a purpose in the story and didn't even feel like a character. Steel was very annoying and Josh Brener (voice actor of Steel) did a **** job at voice acting. The villain twist was so painfully predictable from the start. This movie was very extremely boring from start to finish. Worst movie of 2016."

What comes to mind watching this movie is a lame attempt from the early 2000's to try out something new before superhero movies were big.  But now superhero movies have been taken seriously for over a decade and there's no excuse for this kind of bad writing.

It starts out interesting enough but soon delves into a snorefest.  The first half of the movie I feel like Max is constantly running from something. STOP RUNNING AND DO SOMETHING INTERESTING, DAMN IT. When agents are chasing him there's nothing interesting to it. No badass fights...just Max doing what he does best, running. The first real fight he has is with a wind-like creature and like everything else, is uneventful. He does an energy blast to take it down and that's it. The fight seems very pointless and even by the end of the movie it has you scratching your head. The second fight is the last and with the main villain.  This fight is also uneventful where nothing cool happens. Most of it is the villain monologuing. When a villain has to explain the movie to you in one of the last scenes it shows how lazy the writers are. Don't have a character explain it all to me at the end, show me the story throughout the movie. Make me care about the villain and his motives, don't just vomit the point during the last fight. Give them interesting dialogue instead. Some other points:
I'm not sure what tone they were going for. It seemed to have a semi-serious tone but when Steel shows up the tone changes to a corny comedy. If it was going to be a corny comedy it should have started out as such. When Steel shows up Max's mom shouts from downstairs, ""dinner is ready"" (or something along those lines) but she can't hear Max when he's yelling and breaking stuff because he's freaked out when Steel appears? Also, nobody in the film seems to notice Steel. When Max keeps him in his backpack, Steel will be talking and Max can hear him but nobody else seems to really notice.  It's supposed to be for comedic relief  but it doesn't work if it doesn't make sense. The whole movie screams of crappy lazy writing.
Why did Max get his powers when they moved to that specific place? I don't think it was explained in the movie. The movie would have been so much better if it focused less on story and just tried to be a fun action-packed beat em up superhero movie. The story was so boring, didn't make sense, so obviously lazy, and devoid of any good action. They should have given just a little bit of story (that made sense) and made Max into a badass instead. Wrecking the day of the agents, having cool boss battles, etc.  Even if it ended up being mediocre it would have been a fun afternoon watch.

There's a lot more that's wrong with the movie but this is the stuff that comes to mind right now."

Max Steel is the worst movie i've seen this year.  It's unbelievably lazily thrown together, with choppy editing, some of the worst acting of the year, terrible writing, and an incomprehensible story that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Max himself is so unlikable, stupid, cowardly, and whiny.  When he learns that he has this weird new power, and meets this weird robot, he doesn't even freak out that much.  It's not: ""JESUS, WHAT THE F!@# IS HAPPENING WITH ME?!""  It's: ""Woah... what's going on?""  Max himself is so bland and unoriginal, it's hard to really emphasize with the guy.  Plus, the story is slow and boring, I actually almost fell asleep.  At 4 in the afternoon.  That's not a good sign when you're supposed to be a cool superhero movie.  Aside from terrible cinematography and awful editing, there really isn't much else to talk about.  Max Steel is the most forgettable, uninteresting, unfunny, and terribly made movie i've seen in 2016 so far.  Avoid at all costs.

Max Steel gets a 1/10."

Perhaps I should start with the mindset of the people on set. Word is that they wanted this movie to be PG, but they lost the appeal. Perhaps if they cut out the image of someone pulling out a piece of glass from their leg, maybe this movie would have been PG-rated. While I painfully go through this review, keep in mind that these are the people we're dealing with. Their thought process appears to be topsy-turvy.
Max Steel is the thankfully ill-fated adaptation of a line of action figure toys brought to us by Mattel, and if I had to sum up the plot, I would point to Transformers (2007), saying that the two movie have a rather similar plot (not the same, but somewhat similar). Good grief, this movie is cinematic cyanide through and through.
The plotline is continually stupid, followed by the cinematography, which is even worse (especially during one particular scene where the camera couldn't stop cutting from one place to another every 10 or so seconds). The characters are not only bland, but inert and completely weak. Yet, the movie expects me to like a romance between two characters that proves to be even more bland, formulaic, and stupid. These issues are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the problems with this sci-fi time-waster. Even a 12 minute video rant won't be enough for me to summarize this atrocity that deliberately pursued the Golden Raspberry Awards with a seal of disavowal."

Another problem results from its Latino cast, which gets the opportunity to be the lead characters and unfortunately re-nurtures the idea that in the Latino community everyone is either a gardener, a gang member or a cartel member.

The Tax Collector doesn't contribute anything relevant or exciting and is perhaps David Ayer's most disappointing work to date.

One actor (Jesse Metcalfe) even has his own Television show (Dallas) on network TV for crying out loud. The court cases listed in the credits have nothing to do with Christians being persecuted, but have everything to do with Christians doing the persecution. As for the choices made in the story, why on god's green Earth would a teacher need a public defender to defend her in a civil court? And why on great Zeus' Olympus would a teacher be in trouble for uttering the name Jesus? The court cases that have been mentioned in the end credits were examples of Christians doing the persecuting. The real message of the 'God's not Dead' franchise, I believe is this: ""If you don't allow me to persecute you, then you are persecuting me.""

This and the previous instalment of the 'God's not Dead' franchise is trying too hard to get people to believe in Christianity. It's like a sales representative trying too hard to convince a customer to get an extended warranty even after the customer repeatedly says no.

Believe it or not, there is going to be a third 'God's not Dead' instalment coming out sometime this year, and god forbid, we're going to see the same persecution mentality.

To be completely honest with you, this film and Christian films like this, do not resonate in any positive way, shape or form."

Unlike a cheesy fun disaster movie like Armageddon or 2012, Geostorms serious tone doesn't suit the cheesy fun set pieces. Armageddon was fun with plenty of cheese but that felt right in that movie because it didn't take itself too seriously and had comedy elements. Geostorm is super serious in its delivery and would have been less rubbish if it had stayed grounded and intelligent like Deep Impact or Twister instead of going wild with the plot and over the top scenarios. The acting is alright just bland characters with dull dialogue. The parts that made me go from disliking this to hating it was the nonsense Science, the cringe action scenes and the stupid twist halfway through. The science in this movie doesn't make sense and logic is out the window. If you like science you will hate this film. The action is mindless and cringy. During the action you end up internally saying ""Yeah right, like that would happen"" because what you see is something ridiculous happening in a dead serious all be it bad movie. The twist of who done it and why that happens is so stupid and face palming bad, I laughed out loud. Worst big budget disaster movie to date, Sharknado of the big screen !"

1076,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-grandpa/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,AndrewBurge,"May 3, 2018",0,"Let me just get this out of the way first: I have no problem with offensive humor. As long as something which aims to be funny is funny, it means it has served its purpose. The offensiveness is almost always worth it. On that note, Dan Mazer's 'Dirty Grandpa' manages to be offensive without being funny. Seriously, there are barely any jokes here which land. The best of which being one involving a scatophilic fantasy by retired Army veteran **** Kelly (Robert De Niro) involving Queen Latifah and a hot air balloon, but only because De Niro used every single of his acting chops to deliver it as wacky and sudden as possible.

Alas, though! Not ever double Oscar winner Robert De Niro can save this sick and disgusting mess. It seems that writer John Phillips has the philosophy that as long as something is offensive, it has to be funny. But, of course! We love laughing at a drawing of a **** swastika shown to a rabbi, or mindless and absurd drug consumption or even accidental child pornography! We are a bunch of sick pervs! We do not require any attempt at trying to control this controversial scenes through humor. I mean, hey - its offensive so its gotta be funny. Right?

And this is not even the worst part! What really makes this film implode upon itself is the failure of its director of getting the best out of scenes which could have intelligent humor potential. One such example is when well-cut and straight as an arrow lawyer Jason Kelly (Zac Efron) ends up in jail after being led into drug consumption. He starts a conversation with the local police guards about human rights and law all while the two policemen mock him all while favoring the local drug dealer. But this scene progressively gets worse and worse and instead of dropping out of it, director Mazer keeps pushing transforming it into senseless, illogical and, at times, even disturbing gibberish.

To be honest, at the start, this looked like a pretty mediocre film. But close to the end, it gets messy and straight-up racist making a mockery of the African-American culture's use of the N-word, among others. It is offensive but not funny, aims to give family principles but ends up pairing an old retiree with a teenage girl and worst, is De Niro's worst screen choice yet... God knows we need 'The Irishman' now more than ever."

There's really not an underuse of characters, but the overuse of a few characters and the 'idiot cop gag' lead to gaps in the film being completely laugh free. Audrey Plaza, Zac Efron, and Robert De Niro all give wacky, completely unrealistic character performances and deliver lines with the attempt to create belly laughs, but John M Phillips writing services them nothing interesting to say. The most problematic issue was the over-the-top drama towards the end of the film that felt incredibly forced and unnatural. Overall, each actor in this 'comedy' deserves the respect that none of their performances felt like this film was just another pay check for them. Plus the editing and cinematography is well done for the most part. Dirty Grandpa, however, is just too unfunny to be considered even a decent comedy, since very little of the dialogue and visuals provide much more than uncomfortable chuckles."

Basically it boils down to an old widowed ""grandpa"" who just wants to do all the ""dirty"" stuff he could not do while he was faithfully married to grandma. If you sit back and do not take anything too seriously - as in plot line or script - it is very funny from beginning to **** grandpa relives a frat party kinda way! 9 for acting - especially from Deniro, 7 for script and 5 for the predictable plot line...

The movie is a great way to escape into 90 minutes of a ridiculously raunchy funny ""dirty grandpa"" leading his buttoned up grandson from one obscenely raunchy scene to another. What made it work for me was Deniro! He is a veteran genius actor who - no matter what movie he is in - can still carry any scene or movie he wants! Considering the plot line and script was predictable Efron and Deniro played well off each other as the movie jumped from one ridiculous scene to another.

In the end it is a great movie to just sit back drink a beer or two and laugh without expecting much more other than funny acting from Deniro. 90 minutes of grandpa acting and talking like a dirty old man - while his grandson trys to understand what the heck is wrong with my grandpa! I laughed from beginning to end and at least in the past most raunchy frat style movies - ranging from Porky's to Bad Grandpa - made me laugh far less.

1084,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/211/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,MeritCoba,"Mar 10, 2019",3,"It is one of those Netflix flicks I saw because I wanted to see Nicholas Cage act.  Weird, I admit, as Cage isn't known for sublime performances. But that is precisely why! Someone pointed out that Cage's acting could be seen as deliberately anti-acting. Like, let's say, the Joker as played by Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight Cage is over the top, but while Ledger pulls it off marvelously, Cages over-acting is often a dud. Perhaps often is an understatement. But with 211 Cage surprises again by putting in a such a run-of-the-mill performance that one can only giggle.. and giggle and giggle some more.

Cage is in good company(or is that bad?) as the rest of the cast is as bland as used teabags.  There is kind of attempt to make us care for them as the various non-entities get introduced during the long winded first part of the movie, but it doesn't pay off when it should. It is a half-assed attempt anyway, which is why some of the people have no names at all. Oh yes, the fat bloke is shot in the head. Ah yes, the son-in-law is on the verge of dying after being shot(and boo-hoo he has just heard that he has become a father). It makes me pause to consider what makes us connect to **** feel the hurt they feel. Or at least sympathize. Using tropes like: man-hears-he-becomes-a-father-just-before-facing-mortal-peril puts me off. Come on! And of course he doesn't die. It isn't even a spoiler to say so.. it is that kind of movie.(It would at least have been inspired if she wasn't pregnant as he turns out to be infertile. Or she ups and leaves. You know, like real life people sometimes do).

The movie tries to take the serious angle by declaring to be inspired by real life events, but it is just that: inspired, not based on. If they would have based it on the North Hollywood Shootout(which is the one they mean), they would have altered the movie significantly. For one, there was never a pause. The two dudes(not four) came out and the fight was on: what you would call a running battle. There were also no hostages. But the movie has the robbers sit inside the bank for some time with hostages, so where the heck is the negotiator? And why show the police as having AR-15 as the lack of them was the whole point in the real shootout: that the police did not have the necessary firepower to stop the heavily armed and armored robbers?(It is just infuriating when you watch an interview with a former LAPD Swat team member who explains just that and why it can not happen now and this movie gets exactly this point wrong).

Then the Swat team does arrive - which takes ages unlike with the real shootout -, they get time to set up the assault and do so is a very clumsy way. As said: there is no negotiator but there are also no snipers and the teams only use what must be a smoke grenade. And why they heck do they press the assault when the hostages are send out?

But possibly the worst part of the movie is the utter unrealistic carelessness for human suffering with the cops. When the backup arrives with their AR-15's, they waist no time to shower the bank with a hail of bullets while it is obvious that they have hostages in there and it is very likely they hit them first. In addition they leave one of the survivors of the coffee cup bombing unattended while it is clear she is in a terrible state. And finally they don't give a rats ass that Cage has an obvious nervous breakdown after being on the receiving end of a barrage of bullets and thinking his son-in-law has died. But the only thing the officer in charge does is telling him to calm down. It is almost like the slap-in-the-face trope, without the slap in the face. But anyway, in this movie it works as Cage then takes charge and goes Rambo.

There is an utter lack of seriousness in the whole movie that tries to pawn itself off as being serious. And there lies the issue. There is so much unrealism in this movie(a band of experienced mercenaries robbing a bank for a trifle?) that the whole inspiration becomes silly. If this is inspired by real life events, then Lord of the Rings is inspired by the First World War, Star wars by the American revolution, and Pearl Harbor by Pearl Harbor(and one of these might actually be true). It would have been better if they had not taken this all too serious, but just made a stupid action flick with an over the top bad/good guy. Cage can do that. That is his thing.

This is another Netflix dud. Netflix Orginal is becoming a byword for underperforming. Netflix: get a hold of yourself. Merit"

The fact is that Cage is one of the most active stars in Hollywood, willing to take on any role, and there in lies the problem. His most recent film, 211, may be one of the most pointless and uninteresting action films ever made. Four mercenaries who are looking to get back at their corrupt boss, start robbing banks where he keeps his money. This leads them to the small town of Chesterfield, where a job is interrupted by the police, leading to a stand-off. Cage stars as Mike Chandler, an officer nearing his retirement, saddled with his son-in-law as a partner. What made 211 so bad is that the stand-off and shoot outs take over the majority of the time and Dog Day Afternoon, this film is not. Aside from the occasional expletives, there are long shoot out sequences with no dialogue. When the action cools down and people finally do speak, it's actually worse, because then the lack of experience and talent of the supporting cast is painfully evident. Action movies are supposed to be exciting and get the blood pumping, even if the story isn't all that great, it's something the genre has lived on since the 1970s, but 211 is an action filmed that bored me. When one is watching an action film and nodding off, it is an indicator that something is seriously wrong with that film.

The fact that it wasn’t pre-screened for critics, opening cold Friday was sort of a hint that it wasn’t good and it isn’t. There is about one minute with a limbo contest between Freeman and Jones that may give you a hint of a smile but that is it! Freeman fares the best but that is strictly due to his persona.

I seldom, if ever, negative about performers looks but I have to make a few general comments here. Both Freeman and Jones are aging fine up to this point but of the women I wish Elizabeth Ashley hadn’t appeared on the screen as I once thought this woman was beautiful but, to me, that’s not true anymore. I didn’t, gratefully, recognize Jane Seymour during the movie and had to check the credits out to see what part she played.

I am not just picking on the women as I am still shaking my head over my ‘idol’, for many reasons, Johnny Mathis! We are both the same age but he looks 20 years older than he should plus the two songs he sang didn’t sound like the Mathis I know.

The biggest problem with Life Itself is that it doesn't trust the audience to understand and make connections with the characters. It sets up contrived plot devices and tragedies with no originality and then has the balls to laud itself unironically as ""unique and original."" It has the unmitigated STONES to compare itself to Pulp Fiction. This movie is nothing like Pulp Fiction. If anything, Life Itself is a less-good rip-off of 500 Days of Summer and Manchester By The Sea, but it doesn't even understand how those two movies work.

The premise of Life Itself is that there are two families tied together by a single traumatic event. Characters are drowned in horrible tragedies, there is a Spanish sub-plot that feels tacked on, and the fact that the script tries to tie it all together at the end to make a profound statement is so degrading that the only real tragedy is that I wasted my time watching this movie at all. The movie's theme is ""Life Itself is the ultimate unreliable narrator."" The movie has no problem spoon-feeding you this theme and saying it out loud word-for-word multiple times during the movie.

by JOAN ALPERIN on SEPTEMBER 18, 2018

A CELEBRATION OF LIFE ITSELF
Writer/director Dan Fogelman is currently represented on TV with his creation This Is Us, which follows two parents and their three children, born on the same day as their father. Now entering its third season, the NBC show takes place in the present but also utilizes flashbacks so we see how events in the past shape who the characters are today.

In Life Itself – which opens in cinemas this week — Fogelman uses a similar technique, but now weaves together a story that concerns multiple couples over numerous generations and how they are all connected by one event.

It begins with Will (excellent Oscar Isaac) and Abby (Olivia Wilde), who are first shown at a college party, where Will says he’s “just waiting for the right moment” to ask her out. “Because when I ask you out, there’s not going to be any turning back for me.” At one point, he becomes the narrator of his story informing us that “he loves her like a stalker.”
We then find a disheveled Will at the office of his shrink (Annette Bening), where he relates that it’s strange to think about how a completely random moment would shape an entire life. Then it’s back to Abby and Will, now madly in love, married and pregnant.

Fate will link them to Dylan (Olivia Cooke) a troubled young woman trying to find her way in the world, and her grandfather Irwin (Mandy Patinkin). Then it’s off to Spain where we meet a rich plantation owner, Mr. Saccione (the wonderful Antonio Banderas), his plantation manager Javier (Sergio Peris-Mencheta), and Javier’s wife Isabel (Laia Costa) and their son Rodrigo (Alex Monner). It’s their poignant story that will take one of them back to where the film began — the streets of New York City.

Spanning decades as well as continents, the film explores the human condition and all its complications: love, family, tragedy, joy, fate and — in the end — life itself. While some may see this tearjerker as manipulative, I absolutely loved every second of it, my favorite of the year so far.

Barf."

Also love the fact that the pull quote they used for the physical media packaging was taken so far out of context that the reviewer felt compelled to post a follow up article to publicly shame the media company responsible. The director had his name removed from this project for a very good reason. Do not rent it under any circumstances.

The movie is even politically stupid because its message is not well delivered. Skip it while you're still alive"

The post-production process must have been a mess, as everything was jumbled and largely nonsensical. A shame."
1104,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lovers/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,quincytheodore,"Jul 19, 2015",3,"For such cosmetically grand movie, The Lovers is unbearably bland. In a way the movie reminds me of Jackie Chan's The Myth. Both follow the story of a researcher in a quest to find ancient artifact. Along the way his consciousness is mysteriously and magically transported across space and time. Thus, he relives the past life in awkward parallel perspective. It has all sorts of epic romance fantasy elements, all of them are merely skin deep, and most importantly it lacks any charm on the characters.

The main problem is the movie tries so hard to pack beautiful scenery, it sporadically shift sequences without establishing the character in any meaningful manner. First act alone sees myriad of subplots, it immediately enters a conspiracy, political and love banters. Note that it opens with two different timelines and stories, so when the movie introduces predicament so suddenly, it barely gives any sense of familiarity for the characters and audience probably wouldn’t care much for them.

Writing is similar to astrology reading, fortune telling, or straight up fortune cookie gibberish. It wants to be a romantic lore, yet it sounds very pretentious with its ""love conquers all"" cliché. This ultimately ruins the characters as even though the cast is good, the material barely give them any depth or recognizable trait other than fantasy wannabes. The drive for relationship is simply absent.

It doesn't create momentum, and the drab pace continues, or even worsens towards the end. It's as though the vistas are the actual star and these people are the background. There are some good views here, it's clearly an above average production with costumes, intricate sets and occasional action scattered between. However, without amiable personalities, it becomes a boring escapade with cheap plastic romance.

Flair for aesthetic won't help much if the core human drama is overwhelmingly barren."

The acting, all of it, is pretty bland. And the second act? Not good but the second half of the second act might be the best part of the whole movie. The pacing doesn’t seem off at all. In fact, this movie is paced well after the first act. Once again, the child actors are highlights. They might be better than any performance in this film. So I dislike it more after rewatching.

Verdict:
Replicas is much worse than what I said last time. It  does everything you expect it to do and does absolutely nothing special. It’s a waste of time.

Rating:
4/10 - Bad"
1113,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/replicas-2018/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,Live2Rise,"Mar 5, 2019",1,"It really does boggle my mind to see a film this messy, this incoherent, this lacking in substance and plot, so rampantly silly and so clueless in story direction this early in 2019. But this is what “Replicas” gives us and it’s the first big steaming heap of feces this year has given us. It’s mundane, it’s carelessly stupid, the film is only funny when it’s unintentional, the acting is completely flat, the dialogue is just UGH, there’s no coherent direction due to the film not sticking to one story, so many gaping plot points and questions are shown and asked, none of which actually get answered or resolved, every attempt at forced emotion fails and if anything, Keanu Reeves is basically acting like a parody of himself in a half-assed performance, like how he was in the 80’s and 90’s. Speaking of 80’s and 90’s, I think that’s the best way to describe this movie: it’s a bad 80’s sci-fi flick, 90’s sci-fi flick released in the dumping grounds of January. And boy does it feel like it. Nothing in this film makes any sense. And you wanna know what also doesn’t make sense? The fact that this film has the audacity, the nerve to try and leave a cliffhanger for a potential sequel that’s never gonna see the light of day, it’s just—if this thing does get a sequel......I—

I have no words. I’m done."

With ""Replicas"", we have an unbelievably stupid sci-fi flick with some of Keanu's worst acting ever (and that's saying a lot). It's unintentionally hilarious and just everything was horrible. It's the worst film of 2019, and at the time of writing, it's only 17 January."

Horrible waste of time.

The movie looked like it had some promise, with an interesting story line, but it turns awful, and the ending is infuriating.  I guarantee you say, ""That's it?"" at the ending.

The character in the red/yellow coat is ridiculous, and a lot of the assassins and assassinations are ridiculous, too.  So mad I wasted time on this."
1118,https://www.metacritic.com/movie/polar/user-reviews/?filter=Negative%20Reviews,Broyax,"Jul 21, 2021",3,"Dans ce « polar », on a surtout bien des clichés comme celui du tueur d’élite désireux de prendre une retraite (bien méritée…) mais qui doit se heurter à l’insu de son plein gré à la drôle d’humeur de son employeur, lequel ne voit certainement pas d’un bon oeil la prime de départ… qu’il lui doit !

En vérité, rien de très sérieux là-dedans, sauf vers la fin via un rebondissement ou plutôt une révélation moisie de derrière les poubelles dont la grognasse insipide Vanessa Hudgens se fait la porte-parole… ridicule de bout en bout, d’ailleurs ! Par contre, on apprécie la belle Katheryn Winnick dans ce rôle secondaire de femme fatale d’une ironie cynique bien agréable. Elle seule et bien entendu l’excellent Mads Mikkelsen (comme d’habitude) tirent un brin leur épingle du jeu dans ce film qui se traîne un tantinet quand même.

Un film qui peut faire sourire de temps en temps par ses excentricités et sa violence exagérée, lesquelles sont nettement inspirées des tarantinades et autres ritchieries volontiers provocatrices qui plaisent tant aux ados (idiots). Notons par ailleurs que l’on voit ici et là de la chair plus ou moins fraîche de bonnasses plus ou moins bonnes mais nous ne ferons pas la fine bouche à cet égard, car… c’est plutôt rare par les temps qui courent !

La réalisation est dans l’ensemble très moyenne, pour ne pas dire pire, la faute à un montage trop souvent cut dans l’action (sanglante certes) qui aurait mérité bien plus d’attention. Souvent débile, parfois drolatique (mais rarement) très brutal et un peu voyeur, « Polar » reste ce qu’il est, à savoir un gros nanar !"

I can’t believe the user score is this high. It must be a bunch of apologists swarming in to defend this absolutely horrible ripoff of John Wick. This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I’m giving this a 3 because I want my review to stand out from the 0 scores that flood just about everything. This is not worth your time, it’s awful, terrible, trash. It’s a completely worthless piece of garbage. Avoid at all costs. Yes, it even includes a dog for about 5 minutes.

Except Polar is a Polish shooter in the world of AAA projects. In it seems everything is not submitted seriously, characters cartoon. The script was written by a 5 of the first class, and the characters are completely not specified characters. In general, it turns out that the film is one big parody. And even you watch it to the end not because the actors play perfectly, or the script is so fascinating, but because it is just interesting how this circus will develop further. By the result in the film there is only one element that succeeded - acting Mads Mikkelsen."

The film centers around a famous young novelist with a negligible life until a couple of melodramatically tragic twists, to which he reacts by deciding to return to anonymity (Mr. Nobody). Such an empty existence of an embarrassing presumption is depicted with a non-linear narrative, through elliptical flashbacks and flash-forwards on three different timelines. In the absence of a substantial content, the expressive form is messed up."

Sure some people may found this film as new cult classic and even I had some some laughs while watching it but overall this work is one very headache making product.
Travolta was here awful and his carrere just falls down and down with zero chance of return.
Devon Sawa was also very disposable and even though he gived some good acting abbilities ,his character was just to forgettable and not so good to.
Story was full of idioticy and scenes that will leave you in cringe inducing coma.

Whoever sanctioned its production must have had their family held at gunpoint because I cannot think of any other reason why such a dire film would make it off a script checking level.
The portrayal of First People in this film are truly horrendous not to mention a complete travesty of any sort of accuracy (I am aware it was supposed to be a comedy) this wouldn’t be a problem if it were done in a clever ,self aware way a la Snatch but I got no hint that this film was even aware of quite how offensive and damaging it’s abuse of a nations people it was trashing.
I know sandler has some sort of watertight deal to make films akin to Princes record deal but holy **** this stinker was a new low for him and that really is saying something. If you are reading this avoid this film like you would a maggot filled corpse dangerously bloated in the full sun.

There is literally nothing redeemable about this movie, yeah you may chuckle here and there but there is literally nothing redeemable about Adam Sandler's latest attempt to make a even mildly entertaining movie. Thats the frustrating thing, I believe Adam Sandler can act and can make a good movie. Hes proven it in in the past with good movies like Reign Over Me, Spanglish, Punchdrunk Love, Funny People, or even Click but he continues to waste away his career with these pointless and downright lazy films that he actually thinks people will find funny. His performance in this movie even seems phoned in,  Taylor Lautner is bad and while the rest of the cast manage to do a decent job at being not as bad. It almost doesn't help their case that the film has almost no story of substance, the dialogue is laughable, and the characters are lower than anything youd come to expect in an adam sandler flick. Its lazy film making and a perfect example of just how lazy Adam Sandler has become."

While none of the characters in this film nail biting obnoxious as in previous Madison films like Eight Crazy Nights and Jack & Jill it’s still not enough. After the six are assembled they go from one distraction to another on their slow journey most of which is unmemorable and leads to a dull a film. None of the Ridiculous Six are entertaining each of which leading to one the Happy Madison comedy wheel of poop, race, and stupid voices. Except for Sandler who plays the role surprisingly serious contrasting to the supposed comedic tone of the film. The deadpan role is so serious you’ll somewhat miss his stupid voices or at least wish he was doing red-face. While last year’s western comedy A Million Ways to Die in the West occasional found some gold in its dry river The Ridiculous Six is as dull and dry as the desert it is set in."
